REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF KALANGALA DISTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Kalangala District Local Government which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Kalangala District Local Government for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of the District in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below as the key audit matters to be communicated in my report:











As a result, I considered payroll management in LGs a Key Audit Matter and identified crosscutting risks including; unrealistic budgeting for employees and pension costs, under absorption of wage funds, delayed access to the payroll, over payment of salaries, non-payment of salary and pension arrears, among others.

I analysed the approved budget and releases to Kalangala District for salary, pension and gratuity in the period under review, as shown below;

Category	Initial Approved budget (UGX)	Revised budget (UGX)	Amount released (UGX)	%age funding received	
Salary	8,210,136,750	8,897,396,514	8,897,396,514	100

Salary Arrears	-	-	-	-

The wage and Pension Pay roll of UGX.10,481,809,810 constituted 52.1% of the District’s budget for 2020/2021 of UGX.20,128,919,532.

I am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of payroll management activities. A number of Districts did not carry out planned recruitments resulting into huge unspent balances.

Based on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;

No	Observations								Recommendati ons	
1.1	Payment of Salaries, Pension and Gratuity i) Absorption of Funds I reviewed funds absorption and noted that UGX.9.40 billion (89.7%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.10.48 billion, resulting in an unabsorbed balance of UGX.1.08 billion.Billion was subsequently swept back to the consolidatedExpenditure (C)Unspent (B-C)% absorp tionGeneral staff salaries PensionGratuity(UGX ’bns) (UGX ’bns) 8.90 8.90 7.83 1.070.301.280.301.280. 291.270.010.01889799to the table below; Approv ed Estima tes (A) (UGX ’bns)Releases / Warrant (B) (UGX ’bns)fund account.UGX.1.08Refer								advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that there is adequate payroll planning and that funds are utilized for the intended purpose.I

Three positions were advertised but were not filled, accumulating UGX.67,774,212.  Staff under disciplinary measures especially porters were not paid a total of UGX.5,404,948 because of abandonment of duty.appointments were terminated in May 2021 leading to unspent balance which was swept back to treasury.delivery.Under TheTheir

It also requires salaries to be paid correctly, promptly and as a lump sum in accordance with the approved salary structure for the Public Service.review of the payroll data (IPPS) and IFMS payments revealed variances between amounts on the approved payroll and payments to individual employees, leading to Over payments of UGX.1,265,254, contrary to Section B-a (7) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010, as shown in Appendix 1.payment of salaries leads to loss of Government funds.Accounting Officer explained that this was due to IFMS network being slow and duplicating payments.AOverThe									I advised the Accounting Officer to recover the funds from the concerned officers.

directs his/her removal from the payroll.										
iv) Payment of salary using wrong scales A comparison of base pay in the IPPS payroll registers with the salary structure for 2020/21, revealed that 24 staff were paid using wrong salary scales, leading to under payments of UGX.1,281,833, contrary to Section B–a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2010, as shown in Appendix 3.of salary using wrong scales causes creates opportunity for misappropriation of funds and also leads to misstatements of salary expenditure in the financial statements.Accounting Officer attributed this to the following;  Interrupted IPPS internet network throughout the financial year 2020/2021 as a result of new upgrades made by MOPS  Non automatic increment of the segment whenever incremental date is reached.PaymentThe									I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that salary amounts are reconciled periodically to salary scales before effecting payments	
										
v) Delayed deletion of staff from payroll Section B-a (12) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010 requires the payment of salary to public officers to be stopped immediately they cease rendering services to Government under whatever circumstances, including death.noted that UGX.1,480,155 was paid to one staff who had retired, as detailed in table below; Employ ee NameSN.

1.2 Management of Payroll Deductions i) Over/Under remittance of deductions Section B-a (17) requires a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations to be deducted from his or her salary, in accordance with the regulations.noted that whereas UGX.2,448,664,141 was deducted from employees’ salaries to different beneficiaries, UGX.2,446,635,255 was remitted, leading to an under remittance amounting to UGX.73,649,208, as shown in the table below;to be remittedI									I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure his team verifies accuracy of information on Payroll and timely reconcile the results with payment on the IFMS.

	Under remittances could lead to misappropriations of funds not paid to the beneficiaries Additionally, Over remittance of funds could lead to loss of District funds.Accounting Officer attributed under remmittance to the following;  The challenge of the IFMS network which duplicates and at times hides payments after they are validated and then returns them at the closure of Financial year as unpaid.  A result of non remittance of deductions on suspended salary for staff under disciplinary proceedures.The									
ii) Un-authorized loans deductions Section 2.1.2 & 2.1.4 of the service agreement between the Government Uganda Lenders' Association/Uganda Bankers' Association letter of undertaking for each Government employee before making an employee reservation on the PDMS.Consumer requires a(MoPS) andaddition, only deductions consented to by employees, in writing, should be submitted to the MoPS for timely monthly payroll processing or as advised by the employer.Lack of letters of undertaking I noted that the District made unauthorised loan deductions totalling UGX.100,753,524 . The deductions were from 57 employees that did not have letters of undertaking, as shown in Appendix 4(a).is a risk of making deductions from staff that have no loans, which deprives them of their earnings.Accounting Officer explained that this was due to the fact that Financial Institutions offer loans to employees using phones, where management has no control, since an employee receives money before being approved on the PCA. Additionally, financial institutions offer Topup loans without signing new Letters of undertaking.In a) ThereThe									I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all loan applications are backed by letters of undertaking as well as letters of consent by the applicants.the Accounting Officer should liaise with responsible officers to ensure that loans are approved through the PDMS.Additionally,

	iii) Delayed/non-remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA Paragraph 4.6.1 of Establishment Notice No. 2 of 2019 requires payroll deductions to be remitted concurrently with salary payments. I noted that the District made payroll deductions of UGX.317,931,647, but did not remit UGX.22,107,654 to UCLA/UBA. I noted that the District made payroll deductions of UGX.317,931,647 and did not concurrently remitted it with the salary payments in six months with delays of up-to 56 days, as shown in Appendix 5.non remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA could lead to litigation due to delays in payments to the lending institutions.Accounting Officer attributed this to poor IFMS network which slowed down the payment system causing a delay in remitting deductions.Delayed/The	I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that Salary payments and Deductions to respective beneficiaries are approved and paid concurrently.	
	iv) Delayed/ non-remittance of PAYE deductions to URA Section 123(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1997 (as amended) requires withholding agents to URA any tax that has been withheld or that should have been withheld within fifteen days after the end of the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the withholding agent.  I noted that the Management made PAYE deductions of UGX.1,498,987,622, but under remitted UGX.51,366,809 to URA.  I noted delays in the remittance of PAYE deductions to URA deductions of four months with a notable delay of 45 days from April 2021 deductions, as shown in Appendix 6.remittance of PAYE attracts fines and penalties from the Revenue Authority.Accounting Officer attributed this to poor ifms network which slows down the payment system causing a delay in remitting deductions.DelayedThe	putI advised the Accounting Officer to strong internal controls to ensure that officers effect payments promptly invoices created.after are	














	v) Non-deduction of PAYE from political leaders I noted that the District did not subject political leaders’ gratuity totalling to UGX.51,416,102 to the computation of PAYE in IPPS, leading to an under deduction of UGX UGX.11,323,785 contrary to section 19(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act. Details are shown in the Appendix 7.of political leaders’ and commissioner’s gratuity from the computation of PAYE leads to financial loss to Government.Accounting Officer responded that IPPS system does not insert a formula for calculating PAYE from contract gratuity therefore they recalculate PAYE leaders and Chairperson District Service Commission and pay it off IPPS.from gratuity District PoliticalOmissionThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that political leaders’ gratuity is subjected to tax by including in the gross taxable income when computing PAYE	
1.3	Access to Payrolls i) Delayed access to Salary Payroll Section B-a (11) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010, requires Accounting Officers to ensure that Public Officers access the payroll within four (4) weeks from date of assumption of duty.noted that 16 newly recruited/transferred employees delayed to access payroll, with one delay of up-to 150 days (21 weeks), as shown in Appendix 8.access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears.Accounting Officer responded that this was due to the following;  Delay for new employees to obtain TINs due to high transport costs since it was COVID period.  Mismatch of names with NIRA and IPPS  Some transferred teachers report to their duty stations but fail to report to the district in time to affect payroll changes.IDelayedThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to increase monitoring and supervision over the head of human resource to promptly include new staff on the payroll for subsequent payment on IFMS.	
	ii) Delayed access to Pension payroll Paragraph 5.1 of establishment notice no. 1 of 2020 requires responsible officers to initiate and complete the processing of retirement benefits within six months to the mandatory retirement date. In case of death or early retirement, the process should be initiated immediately the Letters of Administration are issued and/or the early retirement has been granted.noted that that three pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays ranging from 31 to 62 days and one case who was expected to access the payroll in August 2020 but by June 2021, he had not as shown in Appendix 9.access to the pension payroll affects the wellbeing of the retirees and also leads to accumulation of pension arrears.Accounting Officer attributed this to mismatches in dates of birth and names between IPPS and NIRA which made it difficult forIDelayedThe	startI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that prospective pensioners submitting pension documentation six months before retirement to ensure timely access to pension payroll.

The Accounting Officer promised to start documenting challenges with the system so that they can be forwarded to relevant authorities for a solution.

2.0

Implementation of the approved budget

A review of the entity’s approved work plans, and budgets revealed that the Kalangala District had an approved budget of UGX.19.3Bn, out of which UGX.17.6Bn was warranted/availed by the end of the financial year. The total expenditure for the year was UGX.16.9Bn out of which UGX.4.4Bn was spent on non-service delivery activities, such as employee costs and transfers to other units (i.e. Town Councils, Sub-counties, Schools), implying that only UGX.12.5Bn was available for implementation of service delivery outputs.

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following significant observation:

No	Observation	Recommendation	
2.1	Existence of Strategic plans that are aligned to NDP- III Regulation 26 (1) of the National Planning Authority (Development of Plans) regulations require entities to submit to NPA their five-year development plans for certification before approval.13 (6) of the PFMA requires the annual budget of all votes to be consistent with the National Development Plan (NDP). In the budget execution circular for 2020/2021, the PS/ST points out that the alignment of Government budgets with the NDP has been poor and was prioritised for improvement during financial year 2020/2021.being the first year of implementation of the NDP-III, the entity was expected to have prepared a strategic plan that is aligned to NDP III and had it approved. It is from this strategic plan that the annual plans would be based to achieve the objectives of NDP-III.noted that the entity had not prepared and approved its strategic plans.There is a risk that activities implemented during the financialISectionThis	I advised the Accounting Officer to urgently prepare a strategic plan aligned to NDP-III and have to facilitate the achievement of the NDP objectives the preparation of annual budgets.it approvedand

2.2.1 Local Revenue (LR) Performance I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX.1,379,547,000 during the year but collected UGX.512,435,984 representing (37%) performance. The of UGX.867,111,016 (63%) were recorded in Local Service Tax, Business Licences and other tax revenues.shortfalls in Local Revenue collectionsin NTR collections at the vote level result in aggregate revenue shortfalls at the treasury level, which negatively affects the implementation of planned activities at a Government-wide level.Accounting Officer explained that due to effects of Covid-19 pandemic the District was under lockdown and businesses at all landing sites collapsed, as well as all fishing activities. 2.2.2 Transfers from other Government Units/Other Government Transfers The entity budgeted to receive UGX.2,549,359,196 as transfers from other Government Units.

Implementation of Uganda Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers Program (UgIFT)

During last year’s audit, it was noted that the district had commenced construction works on Kachanga seed school under the Education Sector and Site clearing of Mulabana Seed School. During my audit of 2021, I carried out audit inspectins at Kachanga Seed Secondary School under this program on 20/10/2021 and made the following observations with details in Appendix 13.

- Construction Works were not yet complete for the two science laboratories, Mult- purpose hall, and class room block.
- Furniture for the class rooms had not yet been supplied.
- Out of the seven (7) classroom blocks only three (3) had windows fitted with glass.
- There was partial supply of laboratory equipment and Computers.

Delayed completion of the project denies the community the intended services.

The Accounting Officer explained that some works were not yet complete due to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the total closure of the site for the sometime. However, the contractor has been working non-stop to ensure that the construction process is completed within the shortest time possible. He also stated that, the partial supply of laboratory equipment and computers arose out the failure of the service provider to deliver items that meet the specifications of the contract and were rejected.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure close supervision of the contractors to complete the project.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer; the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer; and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.











The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the District’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the District’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also;

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts’ internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the District’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However,











future events or conditions may cause the District to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

There were no material findings in respect of the compliance criteria.
