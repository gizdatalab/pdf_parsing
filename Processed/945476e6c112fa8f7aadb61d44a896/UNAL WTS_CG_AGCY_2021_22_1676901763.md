# REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF UGANDA NATIONAL AIRLINES COMPANY LIMITED

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE, 2022**

# THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

# Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive for the year ended 30 th June, 2022, the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June, 2022, the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited for the year ended 30 th June, 2022 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 30 th June, 2022 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and the Companies’ Act 2012.

**Basis for Opinion**  
I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of the Company in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

**Key Audit Matter**  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matter described below to be a key audit matter communicated in my report.

**1.0**

# Implementation of the Approved Budget

Over the years, I have observed improvements in the performance regarding implementation of the budget but entities still face a number of challenges including COVID-19, which continue to affect implementation of activities, service delivery and credibility of the budget. It is against this background that budget performance was considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning. I reviewed documents such as work plans, performance reports, conducted interviews and physical inspection in arriving at my findings.

---

Uganda National Airlines was incorporated on 30th January 2018 under the Companies’ Act, 2001 as a Limited Liability Company. This choice of incorporation was to allow for an eventual listing and floatation of the Company’s shares to the public. The Company set up to enhance the country’s competitiveness by reducing the cost of air transport and easing connectivity to and from Uganda, support faster harnessing of opportunities in the economy (tourism, agriculture, minerals, oil and gas) and fulfil the requirement to establish air transport infrastructure to meet the growing demand for air transport (passenger and cargo).

The entity had an approved budget of UGX.466.010Bn comprising equity financing of UGX.117.626Bn by GOU and revenue financing of UGX.348.384Bn.

The Company’s key deliverables for the financial year under review were as indicated in the table below.

I reviewed the implementation of the approved 2021/2022 GOU funded budget and noted the following;

| **No** | **Observation** | **Recommendation** |  
|---|---|---|  
| **1.1** | **Revenue Performance**  **Performance of Entity Sourced Revenue**  I reviewed the entity sourced revenue estimates for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity budgeted  revenue of UGX.348.384Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.141.750Bn was earned, representing performance of only 40.7%. to earn Revenue shortfalls imply that the company may not finance the activities aimed at attainment of its short term and long term objectives. budget shortfall on revenues was mainly due to non-operationalized routes. The delays on operationalization of the London route which is the major contributor to the budget deficit were mainly regulatory in nature and beyond the Airline’s control. This greatly impacted passenger and cargo revenues. **Implication** The | advised the Accounting Officer to make the necessary lobbying so that the regulatory issues that delayed the launch of the London route are cleared as soon as possible. I |  
| **1.2** | **Lack of approved departmental costed** **work plans supporting the annual budget.**  I observed that the annual budget of the Company was not supported by approved departmental costed work plans. of work plans implies that an assessment of the performance of the Company is not possible. Accounting Officer explained that all departments submit their work plans that are eventually consolidated into one overall Company annual work plan and submitted to the Board for approval. She further explained that due to the suspension of the Board and inauguration of the interim Board, a work plan covering only the period June, July and August was requested for in line with the initial term of the interim Board. She  the departmental work plans would be approved and signed off alongside the overall Company work plan. pledged that going forward; Lack The | advised the Accounting Officer to make the necessary lobbying so that the regulatory issues that delayed the launch of the London route are cleared as soon as possible. I |  
| **1.3** | **Implementation of activities**  I assessed the implementation of a sample of eighteen (18) activities worth UGX.54.866Bn and noted that;   Ten (10) activities worth UGX.46.028Bn were fully implemented,   Three (3) activities worth UGX.2.561Bn were partially implemented and | advised the Accounting Officer to always follow up the availability of funds by GOU in line with the annual cash flow plan issued in accordance with section 15 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 as amended.

- Five (5) activities worth UGX.6.277Bn were not implemented.

Details are in **Appendix I**  
Non-implementation of planned activities despite the entity having realized the entire GOU budget implies that the planned services were not delivered.  
The Accounting Officer explained that implementation of the activities is also dependent on timely receipt of funds from Government. In the year under audit, 58% of the funds were only released to the Airline in the last Quarter of the Financial Year.

**Emphasis of Matter**  
Without modifying my opinion, I would like to draw the readers’ attention to the following matters which have been disclosed in the financial statements.

# 2.0 Long outstanding payables to Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) - UGX.22,824,523,000

Note 23 to the financial statement shows that UGX.23,638,067,000 as payables to Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) remained outstanding as at 30 th June, 2022. At the beginning of the year under audit, a total of UGX.22,834,523,000 was outstanding. The outstanding payables are for unremitted airport taxes that were collected from travellers and were not passed over to UCAA.

Delay to remit the collected taxes due to UCAA may hamper UCAA’s implementation of its planned activities based on the expected receipts.

The Accounting Officer explained that the obligations to UCCA for the FY 2021/2022 were being settled on a monthly basis in the subsequent month apart from the arrears that had been accrued since inception to 30 th June, 2021 of UGX.22,824,523,000 These arrears were submitted to the Ministry of Works and Transport as highlighted in the prior year audit but no funds were released to facilitate their settlement.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the line Ministry to ensure that the liability is settled as soon as possible to enable UCAA to implement its operations smoothly.

---

# 3.0 Failure to transfer revenue collections from the Republic of Burundi- USD.1,233,318

A review of the bank statements indicated that revenue totalling BIF.7,069,969,279 equivalent to USD.3,465,671 (equivalent to UGX.13,051,716,986) was collected by the Company’s station in Bujumbura during the year under review.

Out of the above collection, a total of USD.882,353 (equivalent to UGX.3,322,941,398) was transferred to the station’s operations bank account for its operations while only USD.1,350,000 (equivalent to UGX.5,084,100,000) was remitted to UNACL. This resulted into unremitted revenue of USD.1,233,318 (equivalent to UGX.4,644,675,588)

The Company has limited accessibility to revenues generated in the Republic of Burundi to cater for its requirements which may affect appropriate planning and operations.

The Accounting Officer explained that through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, management has engaged the Governor of the Central Bank of Burundi and it was agreed that portions of the accrued revenue are to be periodically remitted to Uganda Airlines. However, no commitment was obtained as to the amounts and the frequency of remittance as this was subject to different factors at the Burundi Macro level.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the relevant stakeholders to ensure that revenue collected in the Republic of Burundi is transferred to UNACL to enable implementation of company operations.

# Other Matter

In addition to the matters raised above, I consider it necessary to communicate the following matter other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements.

**4.0**

# Financial Analysis and Assessment of the Company's Performance

Financial analysis is a useful tool to draw attention to a number of managerial issues and provides clues to investigate those issues in detail. I carried out financial analysis of Financial Information and the following were identified for the attention of management in order to improve the Company's competitiveness and ensure sustainability of services. The table below refers:

##### Table 3: Financial analysis and assessment of the Company's performance

|---|---|---|---|---|

![](assets_AuditReports%5CMW&T%5CMW&T%5CUNAL%20WTS_CG_AGCY_2021_22_1676901763/img-2101.jpg)

The company's two-year losses and the ratios computed are an indication that Uganda National Airlines Company Ltd is not performing well in terms of profitability and ability to sustain provision of services

The Accounting Officer explained that a detailed Company Strategy has been developed and approved by the Ministry of Works Top Management Team.

I advised the Accounting Officer to fast track the implementation of the detailed Company Strategy that was approved to improve the profitability and ability to sustain provision of services.

**5.0** Lack of a documented policy and procedures for charging charter and cargo** **revenue**  
A review of revenue management framework for charter and cargo revealed that during the financial year, UNACL collected USD.2,082,210 (equivalent to UGX.7,841,602,860) from charter of its air crafts for different destinations and USD.3,422,186 (equivalent to UGX.12,887,952,476) from cargo transporting.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CMW&T%5CMW&T%5CUNAL%20WTS_CG_AGCY_2021_22_1676901763/img-2100.jpg)

According to the management, the charter charges depend on the length of the period for the charter and the charter distance the aircraft is to fly while cargo charges depends on;

- A particular route used,
- Assessment of market at a particular time,
- cargo weight of a particular cargo,
- Cargo type (say perishables or dangerous cargo) and
- Route distance to be travelled.

---

However, I noted that there were no documented policy and procedures approved by the Board to guide the charging of charter and cargo revenue. I further noted that because of the nature of the airline industry which requires flexibility to respond timely to market conditions, the decisions on charge rates are made by the responsible heads of departments with no approved guiding revenue management framework for charter and cargo services.

For instance, many clients, both government departments and private institutions, have been paying uniform amounts of fees yet the time taken is not uniform while others are paying lower than the normal rates charged for similar journeys.

In the absence of a revenue management framework, there is a risk that discretionary decisions for charge rates may be made which may not be in the best interest of the Company. This may result into revenue losses.

The Accounting Officer explained that the air cargo rates are either IATA rates or market rates (rate-sheet and adhoc) and depend on several factors including nature of cargo, the actual and volume weight of the cargo, route and competition environment. At commencement, market rates were set after survey of prevailing rates by the competition. The rates were set to ensure market entry and penetration. The Charter quotes are determined using a quotation template that takes into consideration the unique variables for each Charter request.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that a revenue management framework for cargo and charter revenues collection is streamlined and approved by the Board.

**6.0**

# Lack of an IT Cargo Management System

Section 12.3 (a) of UNACL Finance Processes and Procedures Manual 2020 requires that the revenue system shall operate through interface of the following ERP:

- Cash Management - for recording receipts. Any cash sales received in any of Uganda Airlines' offices will have to be banked by 10:00am of the next day.
- Accounts Receivables — for recording revenue earned on credit basis.
- General Ledger — for maintaining revenue control accounts.

However, I observed that UNACL did not have an IT package for cargo revenue management. According to the management, the system of cargo revenue management was still manual. Cargo revenue agents in different locations/ countries collect, receipt and bank the cargo revenue and then send periodic revenue reports.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CMW&T%5CMW&T%5CUNAL%20WTS_CG_AGCY_2021_22_1676901763/img-2103.jpg)

Without a cargo revenue management IT system, the management cannot carry out on spot system check to monitor the cargo revenue collected. Revenue fraud may go undetected.

The Accounting Officer explained that the contract for the procurement of the cargo management system software was on-going. She further explained that in the interim, management accesses the same system, which has the Revenue Management Module, through DAS Handling Services at a fee of USD.5 per Airway bill and charge the customer USD.15 as Airway bill fees, offsetting the cost and ensuring compliance with all requirements except the revenue accounting function.

---

I urged management to ensure that the procurement of Cargo Management system software is expedited to save the Corporation the fees being charged by DAS handling Services.

# 7.0 Understaffing

UNACL has an approved staff structure of 953 staff which are anticipated to effectively and efficiently enable the Company to execute and achieve its objectives. Out of that approved staffing level, only 502 positions were filled (53%) leaving a staffing gap of 451 positions (47%) as indicated in the table below.

##### Table 4: Understaffing

| **Department** | **Approved** | **Filled** | **Vacant** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| Executive | 2 | 2 | 0 |  
| Flight Operations | 268 | 155 | 113 |  
| Human Resources | 6 | 3 | 3 |  
| Finance & Support Services | 65 | 35 | 30 |

| Dubai | 7 | 3 | 4 |  
| India | 1 | 1 | 0 |  
| Total | 953 | 502 | 451 |  


Understaffing results into heavy workloads on existing staff and affects the Company’s performance, which in turn affects the overall achievement of the Company’s objectives.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Company had run a number of adverts to ensure that staffing levels are improved. It was further explained that as a growing business enterprise, positions are filled as and when funding allows in order not to deplete the meagre revenue and to avoid having redundant staff, i.e. recruitment is made when a new destination is launched, which had not happened in the recent past.  
For other destinations that were launched without substantive staff, contracts were signed with Ground Handling Agents to handle business on behalf of the Company as planning for away forward was being made.

I advised the Accounting Officer to improve the Company’s revenue generation to ensure that the organization's staffing gaps are filled.

# Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ report and responsibility for the financial statements and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

# Accounting Officer’s Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended), and Sections 155 and 233 of the Companies Act, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament and the general meeting of the Company for the funds and resources of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of IFRS and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Company\`s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also;

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

---

- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

**Other Reporting Responsibilities**  
In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

# Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

In accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of the Company with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

# Management Of Information Technology (IT) Investment In Government

The Government of Uganda (GOU) is making large investments in Information Technology (IT) systems because of the tremendous benefits that IT can bring to its operations and services. One of the key programmes of NDPIII 2020/21-2024/25 is D i g i tal Transformation, in which Government of Uganda, aims to increase Information, Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use of digital services for enhancing social and economic development.

As a result of national prioritization of ICT, I undertook a thematic audit covering three financial years’ expenditure (2019/20 to 2021/22) to scrutinize the management of IT Investments across Government. The overall objective was to assess whether the IT investments in Government are strategically aligned, managed appropriately and focused on achieving the NDP III objectives. The procedures undertaken covered: planning and budgeting; procurement, utilization, maintenance and disposal of IT systems; governance, and financial reporting.

For the current year 2021/2022, the entity budgeted for UGX. 6,337,071,664 for acquisition and implementation of IT systems and equipment but spent only UGX. 2,911,322,645 resulting into an under-funding of UGX. 3,425,749,019.

A review of ICT activities implemented during the period revealed the following;

# 9.0 Procurements

**9.1**

# Implementation of Un-Planned Procurements

Section 58(7) of the PPDA Act states that “Procurement shall not be carried out outside the procurement plan except in cases of emergency situations”. Section 3 interprets emergency situation to mean a circumstance which is urgent or unforeseeable or a situation which is not caused by dilatory conduct where:

a) Uganda is seriously threatened by or actually confronted with a disaster, catastrophe, war or an act of God;  
b)  
life or the quality of life or environment may be seriously compromised;  
c)  
the conditions or quality of goods, equipment, buildings or publicly owned capital goods may seriously deteriorate unless action is urgently and necessarily taken to maintain them in their actual value or usefulness;  
d)  
an investment project is seriously delayed for want of minor items; or  
e) a Government programme would be delayed or seriously compromised unless a procurement is undertaken within the required time frame.

However, a review of procurement activities for the year revealed that procurements worth UGX.18,609,252,694 were undertaken outside the procurement plan.

Implementation of unplanned procurements may result into diversion of funds, procurement of goods and services that are not needed or accumulation of unnecessary payables.

Although the Accounting Officer explained that the procurements arise as emergency procurements because there are some aircraft related requirements that cannot be predicted, I noted from a review of the procurements that most of the items including tires, Business class seats, routine spares and tires, self-handling equipment, cargo management system and Microsoft updates are predictable and could have been planned for at the beginning of the financial year.

I advise the Accounting Officer to always undertake a comprehensive needs assessment before coming up with procurement plans. It is also a requirement to update the procurement plan whenever such emergency procurements are made and

have the plan approved in accordance with section 58(4-5) of the PPDA Act (as amended).

# Delayed delivery of one unit of Kayoola Diesel Coach

A review of procurement reference No. UNACL/SUPLS/21-22/00122 indicated that Uganda National Airlines Company Ltd used the direct procurement method and entered into a contract with M/S Kiira Motor Corporation to supply one (1) unit of Kayoola Diesel Coach at a contract price of UGX. 519,687,420 on 28 th February 2022. The contract provided for the bus to be delivered within 120 days after contract signing, i.e. before the end of the year under review.

However, the bus had not been delivered by the time of audit in October 2022, which was four months after expiry of the agreed delivery timeline. It was also noted that the supplier wrote to the Company a letter Ref CEO/22/08/032 dated 30 th August, 2022 indicating that the Company was not able to deliver on schedule due to the need to consolidate a batch of at least five (5) units to make economic sense.

By not delivering Kayoola bus in time, the Company is being denied usage of the priority item. As a result they opt to hire from third parties which further strains the meagre resources of the Company.

The Accounting Officer explained that management had engaged Kayoola management on numerous occasions during the Financial Year and the Company was given a temporary alternative of an electric bus as the ordered one was being assembled.

The Accounting Officer should continue to engage the management of Kiira Motors and ensure that the bus is delivered.

# Lack of an investment and liquidity management policy

The Company made fixed deposits with one Bank to the tune of UGX.14,272,498,800 during the year under review without the existence of an investment and liquidity management policy.  
In the absence of a policy and by investing in only one bank, the company could have missed opportunities of diversification and the funds may have been invested at non- competitive interest rates, resulting into loss of revenue to the Company  
Accounting Officer explained that investment of Company funds and liquidity management is guided by Section 11 of the Risk Management Policy. This will however be reviewed to enhance it with detailed procedures on treasury management.

I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place a comprehensive investment and liquidity management policy in line with the principles of diversification, risk management and profitability.

# Delayed Certification of an Air Maintenance Organization (AMO) and IATA

**membership**  
In compliance with the Uganda Civil Aviation Regulations (2014), the National Airline is required to ensure that its aircraft and related tools, ground support and other equipment are calibrated, maintained and certified by a maintenance organization approved by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA).

---

However, by the time of reporting the AMO approval process which started in 2021 had taken longer than had been planned. The Accounting Officer stated that the UCAA has declined to proceed with the AMO certification project until the Airline appoints a substantive Accountable Manager.

The airline is faced with increased maintenance costs that affect profitability and this would go a long way in curbing increase in direct costs.  
Relatedly the UNACL has not yet obtained membership to IATA. IATA certification helps airlines access its financial settlement systems (ISS) which are the backbone of the global air transport industry, helping to contain costs, improve cash flow and maximize efficiency. IATA also helps members archive cost reductions related to air transport charges, fuel and taxation. The airline was unable to access the planned route to London due to membership requirements.

The Accounting Officer explained that the IATA certification is in progress and set to start in the financial year 2022/2023 with appointment of a consultant who will work with the Airline and be complete by the end of that financial year.

The Accounting Officer should prioritize and fast track the approval and membership of AMO and IATA respectively.
