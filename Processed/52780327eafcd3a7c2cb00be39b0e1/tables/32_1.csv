0,1.0,"Rehabilitation/upgrading of the access road(3.1km) to Busoga College Mwiri in Jinja and paving the parking area at the central materials laboratory in Kireka, Kampala.","Inadequate feasibility studies during design, and increased quantities; Audit noted that the original geometric design was shifted at sections 1+150 to 1+410, and 1+600 to 1+700 with an intention of reducing on the earthworks as indicated in progress reports. It was however noted that the quantities of Cut to spoil, imported subgrade fill material, and stone pitching exceeded the original by 561%, 163.2%, and 31.2% respectively. This is a clear indicator that thorough investigations were not carried out at the design stage."
1, , ,"The omission of essential components in the contract; Audit review of project bills of quantities, and inspection of the implemented project revealed that LHS road edge protection and guard rails were not provided for in the contract."

5, , ,"Quality of Works; Audit undertook DCP tests, and noted that the Subbase layer passed, while there are some weak points in the base layer on the right-hand side of the road. The average CBR for the base layer is 68% on the LHS, and 54.26% on RHS."
6, , ,"Quantity Verification; A comparison of the quantities of the items assessed by the audit team and those certified for payment revealed inconsistencies in some of the quantities of the measured items resulting in an overpayment of UGX.17,486,856"
7, , ,"Insufficient progress reports; Review of availed project documentation revealed that out of the ten (10) reports expected on file, six had been prepared."
