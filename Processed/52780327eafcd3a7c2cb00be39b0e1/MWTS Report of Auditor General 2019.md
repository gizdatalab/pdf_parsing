##### REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MINISTRY OF WORKS AND TRANSPORT

**FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2019**

**THE RT HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT**

##### Opinion

#### I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Ministry of Works and Transport which comprise the statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2019, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together

with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Ministry of Works and Transport for the year ended

## 30 th June 2019 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the

Public Finance Management, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

##### Basis for Opinion

## I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions

(ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s

#### Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Ministry in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme

Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for

#### Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I

believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

##### Key Audit Matters

#### Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were

addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.

**1.0**

##### Implementation of the approved budget

## The Public Finance Management Act 2015, Section 13 (1) and (2) requires preparation

#### of a National Budget in consultation with stakeholders. Section 13 (6) requires that the annual budget is consistent with the National Development Plan. In addition, Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act, 2015, requires the Accounting Officer to

control the regularity and proper use of the money appropriated to the vote.

Further, Section 21(1) of the Public Finance Management Act entrusts the Accounting Officers with the responsibility of planning and managing the entity activities as indicated in the policy statement of the votes based on the annual cash flow plan issued by the Secretary to Treasury during budget execution. Budget estimates are based on outputs to be achieved for the financial year and during implementation,

---

effort should be made to achieve the agreed objectives or targets of the entity within the availed resources.

## The mandate of the Ministry is to plan, develop and maintain an economic, efficient and

effective transport infrastructure and service; manage public works and develop and

#### enforce standards in the construction industry. The Ministry provides policy and strategic guidance to Government parastatal bodies under its supervision, namely; Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Uganda Road

Fund (URF) and Uganda Railways Corporation (URC).

## During the audit, a detailed review of the performance of the Ministry’s approved

budget for the financial year 2018/19 was undertaken with the objective of assessing the extent of delivery of planned outputs. The following matters were observed:

##### 1.1 Revenue performance

The Ministry’s approved budget for the year amounted to UGX.881.billion expected to

## be received from GoU (UGX.455.6bn) and external financing (UGX.425.4 bn) as

indicated table below.

| **No** | **Item** | **GOU (UGX Bn)** | **Donor (UGX Bn)** | **Total (UGX Bn)** |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Budgeted Revenue | 455.6 | 425.4 | **881** |  
| 2 | Receipts | 718.3 | 344.8 | **1,063.1** |  
|| Revenue Performance | 157.7% | 81% | **124.9%** |  


#### Of the projected funding, the ministry realized UGX.718.3 bn from GOU and UGX.344.8 bn in respect of external financing representing 157% and 81% respectively. The funds

received from external financing were transferred by the Ministry to the respective projects, such as upgrading and expansion of Entebbe International Airport under CAA.

**1.2** Implementation of planned activities**

## A review of the implementation of activities revealed that the Ministry planned to

implement a total of 30 outputs during the year. Of these, the audit team sampled 18 outputs representing 60% of the planned outputs for review. The review established that only 1 output representing 5.56% was fully achieved, 16 outputs (88.88%) were partially achieved, while 1 output (5.56%) was not achieved or implemented at all. Details are in **Appendix I.**

## The overall performance of the Ministry in terms of delivery of the expected outputs is

attributed to the following factors:

|| **Observation** | **Recommendation** |  
|---|---|---|  
| **1.3** | **Planning and Budgeting**  The MoWT performance indicators and targets in the MPS vary from those in NDPII.  For a number of indicators, the targets are much lower or higher than the NDPII targets. For instance, the NDPII target for the local motor- vehicle inspection scheme was 600,000 vehicles but 50,000 vehicles were captured in  instrument. Furthermore, a number of  that were prioritized in the NDPII by the Ministry have not been budgeted for. the budget interventions lack of standardization of indicator setting makes it difficult for the Ministry to relate the expenditure activities to outputs/outcome indicators in the various performance reports.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry is engaging MoFPED in liaison with OPM so that the sector targets are in agreement with the National indicators. In addition, the Ministry has engaged MoFPED to increase its budget ceilings to accommodate the prioritized institutional interventions as outlined in NDP11. Therefore the implementation of these interventions remains unfunded.

###### 1.4 Diversion of Funds

There were instances of diversion of funds to other outputs I  
advised the with no relation to the output in question. This impacted on Accounting Officer to the financing of the planned activities resulting in some develop a more activities not being implemented. A total of UGX realistic budget to 1,050,532,082 was found to have been diverted by the avoid

As a result, Management was constrained to

##### Emphasis of Matter

## Without qualifying my opinion, I draw attention to the following matters presented in

the financial statements that, in my judgment, are of such importance and fundamental to users’ understanding of the financial statements:

**2.0 Outstanding domestic arrears**

## Section 21(2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 states that a vote shall not

take any credit from any local company or body unless it has no unpaid domestic arrears from a debt in the previous financial year, and it has the capacity to pay the

#### expenditure from the approved estimates as appropriated by Parliament for that financial year. Further paragraph 10.10.17 of the Treasury Accounting Instructions 2017 states that “An Accounting Officer will ensure that no payments due in any financial year remain unpaid at the end of that year. Towards the close of each financial year, the Head of Finance and Accounts function will take steps to obtain bills

from any persons to whom money may be due, and submit payment vouchers for them to the appropriate Accounting Officer for payment”.

#### A trend analysis of the domestic arrears showed a movement of arrears from UGX. 68,791,650,844 in the previous year to UGX.27,450,457,680 in the year under review, a decrease of 60.1%. The arrears remained unsettled at the close of the year. The table

below shows the trend analysis of the domestic arrears for the past three years:

| **No** | **Year End** | **Amount (UGX)** | **% increase/decrease** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| **1** | 30 th June 2017 | 63,806,298,032 ||  
| **2** | 30 th June 2018 | 68,791,650,844 | 7.8% |  
| **3** | 30 th June 2019 | 27,450,457,680 | -60.1% |  


## I noted that the major component of the arrears outstanding related to pension for

former employees of the Uganda Railways Corporation (URC). In the financial year

---

#### 2017/18, the Ministry took over the payment of salary arrears for 1,200 Uganda Railways Corporation pensioners and these pension amounts were to be budgeted

under the Ministry.

At the close of the financial year 2018/19, the Ministry received a court order to pay

## URC pensioners arrears amounting to UGX. 14.42 billion. These had not been budgeted

for and have been accrued in the financial statements.

## Accrued domestic arrears negatively impact on budget performance in the subsequent

year as outputs anticipated in the appropriated budget cannot be attained due to

## settlement of the arrears. They also present a risk of litigation for non-payment. In

addition, delayed payment of retired staff denies them the right to their social benefits and deprives them of a good social life after retirement.

#### The Accounting Officer explained that a request to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MOFPED) to release funds amounting to UGX 14.42 bn to

pay URC Pension arrears had been made.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that sufficient budget provisions are made to

enable settlement of the outstanding arrears.

##### Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information

#### comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer and other supplementary information. The

other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a

## material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have

nothing to report in this regard.

**Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements**

## Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and

#### Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Ministry of Works and Transport.

#### The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such

internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

#### In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Ministry’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer

has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Ministry’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

## My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a

whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an

---

## auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a

## material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

## As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain

professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:-

##  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether

due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

## The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

##  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

#### expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Ministry’s internal control.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

##  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty

## exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Ministry’s

ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial

## statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions

are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However,

## future events or conditions may cause the Ministry to cease to continue as a going

concern.

##  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

## I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope

and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in

## internal control that I identify during my audit.

## I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

## From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that

were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare

## circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because

the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

##### Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my

---

opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

##### Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

## The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters

are as follows;

##### 3.0 Engineering Audit of a Selected Sample of Road and Bridge Projects implemented by the Ministry of Works and Transport during the Financial Year 2018/19

During the financial year 2018/19, the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) implemented 155 public works projects whose contracts amounted to

#### UGX.1,652,739,749,464. The OAG undertook technical audits on a sample of fourteen (14) projects worth UGX 27,195,600,966 representing 1.64% of the total value of the

projects.

## The projects consisted of eleven road construction/rehabilitation projects, of which six

were under the road interconnectivity program, one from the urban roads sealing

#### program while four were under the Low Cost Sealing (LCS) program. In addition, three bridge projects of which one is a swamp crossing were assessed. The list of projects

audited is presented below;

## Below is a summary of key audit findings. Details including the management responses

and recommendations can be obtained in the detailed technical report which was issued separately and forms an integral part of this report.

##### 3.1.1 Planning and Design (i) Inadequate Feasibility Studies

It was observed that on the projects of the upgrading of the access road to Busoga

## College Mwiri and rehabilitation of Bulucheke-Muchomo-Nyende Road, there was a

substantial increase in the quantities of some of the items implemented (as shown in the table below) which is indicative of inadequate feasibility studies during the planning and design phase.

| **S/No** | **Project** | **Item** | **% Increase** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Rehabilitation/Upgrading of the Access Road(3.1km) to Busoga College Mwiri in Jinja and Paving the Parking Area at Central Materials Laboratory in Kireka Kampala | Cut to Spoil | 561% |  
|^|^| Imported Subgrade Fill | 163.2% |  
|^|^| Stone Pitching | 31.2% |  
| 2 | Rehabilitation of Bulucheke- Muchomo-Nyende Road | Common excavation or cut to spoil of soft material | 161% |  
|^|^| Rock excavation or cut to spoil in rock | 2,456% |  
|^|^| Fill as instructed by the engineer | 197% |  


## It was further observed that for the construction of Kisaigi Bridge in Kakumiro District,

the design of the project was changed majorly from 15m to 17m span due to the

#### widening of the river banks. This implies that feasibility studies were insufficient during the design process. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that for future projects

and especially for projects in hilly terrain, feasibility studies are properly undertaken so as to avoid a substantial increase in quantities of executed items.

---

##### (ii) The omission of Essential Work Items

Essential items such as speed control infrastructure, stone pitching and river training

#### were noted to have been omitted on the low cost sealing projects for Kisozi – Nawanyago Road Sections A and B while Left Hand Side (LHS) road edge protection, and guard rails were not provided for in the contract for rehabilitation of the Access Road to Busoga College Mwiri. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the omitted work items are executed

and for future projects, detailed planning is undertaken to ensure that all items are catered for in the contract.

##### (iii) Preparation of BoQ’s for Low Cost Sealing Projects

#### Review of the BoQs prepared for the low cost sealing projects indicated that a number of items included within the BoQ were not aligned to the specifications with regards to

the numbering and units of measurement for example; clearing and grubbing, preparation of the roadbed whose units were linear meters instead of cubic meters.

#### Further, it was established that a number of items that are specified as non-separately measurable/payable items within the specifications had been included in the BoQs. These included; restoration of borrow pits, Construction of access roads to quarry sites including their maintenance throughout the working period, Preparation of quarry Sites

consisting of clearing vegetation and removing topsoil.  
The Accounting Officer explained that the specifications for Low volume roads were

#### developed and eventually approved in 2018 after the BoQs of these contracts had been prepared. However, all BoQs for new projects shall be aligned with the General

Specification for low volume roads.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to ensure that BoQs

prepared are aligned to the specifications of the respective work in terms of units of measurements and numbering.

##### 3.1.2 Progress of Works

## Of the fourteen (14) projects assessed, five (5) projects were found to have been

completed within the contractual timelines, seven (7) had been delayed; one (1) was still on-going within the extended period but was lagging behind schedule while works for one (1) had been suspended. The Accounting Officer indicated that liquidated damages shall be charged to all contractors who fail to complete the works within the contractual timelines.  
I advised the Accounting Officer to institute a comprehensive investigation into the causes of delays of completion of works and set up the appropriate remedial measures.

##### 3.1.3 Unjustified Extensions of Time

It was noted that on six (6) of the fourteen projects, extension of times was granted

## to the contractors due to inclement weather. However, it is the opinion of the audit

that the extension of time granted was unjustified because;

#### (i) The extension of time arising from the heavy rainfall was not computed as per

the procedures set out in section 1229 of the general specifications for road and bridge works and there was no authenticated rainfall data provided by the contractor.

#### (ii) There was no evidence of consideration of the performance of the contractor in

the assessment of his consideration for the extension of time.

## (iii) The computation of extension of time on two of the projects took into

consideration the same months when the contractor was off site.

---

#### As a result of the unjustified extension of time, UGX.178,014,445.57 was forfeited by the Ministry in liquidated damages as detailed below;

| **Project** | **Contract Sum (UGX)** | **Damages per Day** | **No of Days** | **Liquidated Damages (UGX)** |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Rehabilitation of roads in Rubanda District | 905,192,042 | 452,596 | 60 | 27,155,761.26 |  
| Rehabilitation of roads in Alebtong District | 385,706,600 | 192,853 | 30 | 5,785,599.00 |  
| Rehabilitation of roads in Lira South | 819,802,640 | 409,901 | 40 | 16,396,052.80 |

| **Total** |||| **178,014,445.57** |  


## The Accounting Officer indicated that for future projects, extension of time arising from

inclement rainfall shall be computed based on the formulae provided in the general specifications for road and bridge works.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to ensure that extension of

time arising from inclement rainfall is always computed as per the procedures set out in the specifications and the requisite authenticated documentation forms the basis for this computation.

**3.1.4 Delayed Submission of Performance Guarantees**

## Whereas the works contracts required the contractors to submit performance

guarantees within 21 days of contract signing, it was observed five (5) of the contractors delayed submission of the performance guarantees with delays ranging

#### from 33 days to 223 days. Delayed submission of performance guarantees exposes the Ministry to the risk of loss in case the contractor breaches the contract and also

constitutes a fundamental breach of contract as per clause 59.2(f).

#### The Accounting Officer explained that no payments for works were affected to any of the contractors without performance guarantees and in addition, the Ministry was

regularly instructing the contractors to submit the performance guarantees.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to ensure that contractors

submit performance guarantees within the stipulated contractual timelines.

##### 3.1.5 Payment/Certification for Excess Quantities

#### It was noted that on some of the projects, certifications and payments equivalent to UGX.202,288,300 had been made for quantities of works in excess of those executed. The table below shows the value of the certifications and payments made in excess of

the quantities executed on various contracts.

| **S/N** | **Project Name** | **Certification/ Payment In Excess Of Executed Qty (UGX)** |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Rehabilitation/Upgrading of the Access Road(3.1km) to Busoga College Mwiri in Jinja | 17,486,856 |  
| 2 | Rehabilitation of Runga-Waaki-Butiaba road in Hoima District (19.2km) | 9,882,810 |  
| 3 | Rehabilitation of Bulucheke-Muchomo-Nyende Road in Bududa District (8.4km) | 22,604,400 |

| 14 | Construction of Kabindula Swamp Crossing in Kyankwanzi District Lot 20 | 64,037,000 |  
| **TOTAL** |<| **202,288,300** |  


## The Accounting Officer indicated that verifications shall be undertaken and where

overpayments are established, the excess payment shall be recovered from the contractors’ subsequent payments.

## I have advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the amounts certified and paid in

excess of the quantities executed are recovered from the contractors prior to

## concluding the contracts. MoWT should also ensure that accurate measurement of

executed works are undertaken by the supervising staff before payments are effected.

**3.1.6 Implementation of Road Safety, Environmental and Social Safeguards**

## During the physical site inspection of the works, poor adherence to environmental and

social safeguards was observed;

#### i. Kasaigi Bridge had been opened to traffic despite the fact that guard/handrails had not

yet been installed which could compromise the safety of both motorists and

## pedestrians. At Kabindula swamp, the constructed diversion had been washed away

and the temporary crossing provided could not be used by vehicular traffic and was also unsafe for pedestrians as it consisted of broken timber pieces placed over the

#### structures being constructed. Further, it was observed that the contractors for the low cost sealing of sections A and B of Nyaruzigati-Kyapa-Kitabu Road in Kasese District

had not provided traffic signage or diversions despite having damped gravel in different sections of the road.

#### ii. Environmental requirements for road works in respect of restoration of borrow pits after

exploitation were not addressed for two projects namely; Rehabilitation of roads in

## Alebtong District and Rehabilitation of roads in Rubanda District. Furthermore, poor

disposal of equipment fuel/oil was observed in the yard of the contractor responsible for the construction of Kasaigi Bridge.

#### iii. The contractor responsible for the low cost sealing of section B of Nyaruzigati-Kyapa- Kitabu failed to show the audit team the facilities used for sanitary purposes while the

sanitary facility at Kabindula swamp crossing was constructed just beside the river, without any privacy thereby directly polluting the river. The non-use of Personal

## Protective Equipment (PPEs) was observed at the construction sites for the low cost

sealing of sections A and B of Nyaruzigati-Kyapa-Kitabu Road in Kasese District.

## The Accounting Officer indicated that all the contractors had been instructed to enforce

the required road safety, environmental and social safeguards.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that road safety, environmental and social

safeguard measures are enforced on all projects.

---

##### 3.1.7 Physical Inspection of Works

## During the physical inspection of works, a number of observations were made that if

not corrected could lead to the faster deterioration of the works and as such, would require corrective action prior to completion of the works. These are summarized below;

| **S/No** | **Road Project** | **Observations** |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | of the to Busoga Rehabilitation/Upgrading Access Road(3.1km) College Mwiri in Jinja | pitching Bleeding, stripping, cracked access culvert, damaged stone end structures, pothole development and |  
| 2 | road of Runga-Waaki- in Hoima District Rehabilitation Butiaba (19.2km) | Silted culverts, under scoured culvert apron, unconstructed end structures, washed off culvert backfill |

| 5 | Rehabilitation of Roads in Kasese Municipality | Cracked culverts, washed off culvert backfill, poorly constructed end structures |  
| 6 | Rehabilitation of Roads in Alebtong District | Cracked culverts, broken end structures, washed off culvert backfill, silted culverts |  
| 7 | Rehabilitation of Roads in Lira South | Silted culverts, broken/cracked end structures, |  
| 8 | Low Cost Sealing of Selected District Roads; Lot 1: in Kasese District | Cracked culverts, culvert with exposed mesh, broken end structures |  
| 9 | Low Cost Sealing of Selected District Roads; Lot 2: in Kasese District | Broken culverts, damaged sub-base, silted culverts |  
| 10 | Low Cost Sealing of Selected District Roads; Lot 6: In Kamuli District. | Bleeding, broken end structures, broken and scoured aprons, Stripped capping layer along road carriageway, silted culverts |  
| 11 | Low Cost Sealing of Selected District Roads; Lot 6: in Kamuli District | Silted culverts, damaged culvert bases, washed off culvert backfill, damaged road base, damaged end structures |  
| 12 | Construction of Gem Farm Bailey Bridge in Atiak, Amuru District | Collapsed gabion at Abutment 2 RHS, Inadequate backfill at the approach to the bridge (LHS) in the corner, Need for river training |  
| 13 | Construction of Kisaigi Bridge Kakumiro District Lot 1 in | Honeycombs, collapsing backfill, Crack at Abutment wall, Formwork left within the bridge structure at different locations |  
| 14 | Construction of Kabindula Swamp Crossing in Kyankwanzi District Lot 20 | Extensive  Honeycombing, workmanship on concrete works poor |  


The Accounting Officer indicated that contractors had been instructed to address the identified defects prior to the issue of the practical completion certificate.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all defects observed are rectified and in

addition, the supervising team should thoroughly inspect the works prior to completion and ensure that all defects identified are rectified.

##### 3.1.8 Supervision of the Works

#### All the projects audited were supervised in-house by the staff of the Ministry. For the interconnectivity projects, the Ministry staff were assisted by representatives of the respective District Local Governments. The following general observations were made;

---

##  On eight of the fourteen projects, the number of monthly progress reports prepared

was found to be insufficient.

####  There was no evidence of the appointment of a works supervisor to undertake the daily supervision of works on Runga-Waaki-Butiaba road while there was delayed

appointment of a clerk of works on the projects for low cost sealing of Kisozi – Nawanyago Road Sections A and B.

##  On the construction of Kabindula Swamp crossing, the observations made during

physical inspections, and field tests were undertaken are indicative of the poor supervision of the concrete works.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to improve the contract

supervision and monitoring arrangements.

**3.1.9 Assessment of Quality of Works**

## During the physical inspection, in-situ tests were undertaken to assess the quality of

## the works. The results obtained indicated that on some of the projects, some elements

of the works did not meet the required specifications;

| **S/No** | **Road Project** | **Test** | **Failed Parameters** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Upgrading of Busoga College Mwiri Road | DCP | CBR - there are some weak points in the base layer on the right-hand side of the road |  
|| Construction of Kasaigi Bridge | Rebound Hammer Test | Concrete Compressive Strength of Wing Walls Kagadi Side LHS & RHS |  
| 3 | Construction of Kabindula Swamp crossing || Concrete compressive strength of Headwall (RHS), Headwall (LHS), Headwall (LHS), Wing wall (LHS), Headwall (RHS), Headwall (RHS), Headwall (LHS) at 0+170, 0+170, 0+255, 0+255, 0+215, 0+200, 0+200 respectively |  


The Accounting Officer indicated that further investigations shall be undertaken and in the event of failure appropriate remedies shall be undertaken.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to undertake further tests on the failed work elements

and undertake appropriate remedial action.

##### 3.1.10 Summary of Key Findings per Project

The Summary of Key findings for each of the projects audited for the FY 2018/19 is provided in **Appendix II.**

**4.0**

##### Staff Performance Management Initiatives

The Government of Uganda has been implementing Public Service Reforms since the 1990s geared towards cultivating a performance culture focused on results, excellence,

## and professionalism. Consequently, a number of performance management initiatives

have been introduced for enhancing performance and service delivery in the Public

## Service. These include Open Performance Appraisal System, Rewards and Sanctions

Framework, Client Charters and Service Delivery Standards and Performance Agreements/Plans among others.

## To implement the staff performance management initiatives, public service issued

Circular Standing Instructions No. 1 of 2010, Circular Standing Instruction No. 1 of 2016, Public Service Standing Orders, Circular Standing Instruction No.1 Of 2011 to offer guidance to MDAs and Local Governments in undertaking the different activities on staff performance management.

---

Ministry of Works and Transport has an approved organization structure comprising of 788 staff out of which 576 posts have been filled, leaving a balance of 212 posts vacant. I undertook a review of the ministry staff in post to examine how the entity has

#### implemented the above initiatives and I noted the following;  57 out of the 59 members of Senior Management had not completed Performance Agreements by 31st July 2018 contrary to Section 1.3 of the circular standing

instructions No. 1 of 2010.

##  There were no development plans undertaken for 788 staff during the year under

review.

##  Out of 594 staff in post at the beginning of the financial year, only 135 staff

completed the performance appraisals while 459 did not undertake the activity.

####  The Ministry had not submitted any performance appraisals to the Ministry of Public Service by 15th September 2018 as required by the guidelines.  The Ministry did not carry out performance reviews for 594 staff in the year under

review.

##  The Ministry did not carry out any performance improvement initiatives in the

audited year to address gaps noted during the previous year’s assessment of staff performance.

- Reports on performance agreements, performance appraisals and performance improvement plans were not submitted to MoPS contrary to the set timelines.

##  There were no reports prepared on absenteeism.

## I advised management to ensure that all the prescribed performance management

procedures are enforced.

##### Compensations by Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) Project

The Government of Uganda is undertaking the development of the Standard Gauge

## Railway (SGR) through the Ministry of Works and Transport as well as the development

## of the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) Light Rail Mass Transit (LRT) system.

A total of 1,724Km of SGR and 240Km of LRT will be developed in a phased manner.

#### The Main SGR project is being implemented as a regional project with Uganda’s partner states of Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan and the network will stretch from Mombasa

through Nairobi to Kampala, Kigali, and Juba.

Acquisition of Right of Way (RoW) is a key component of this project and involves the

## compensation of the landowners, commonly referred to as Project Affected Persons

(PAPs) whose land will be taken over. A review of the payments made for PAPs by the

## SGR Project under the Ministry revealed the following;

##### 4.5.1 Delays in the valuation of PAPs

The guidelines for compensation assessment under the Land Acquisition Act require the

## office of the Chief Government Valuer (CGV) who heads the valuation division in the

Directorate of Land Management in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban

#### Development (MOLHUD), to provide timely and reliable real property valuations to Government. The period within which the official assessor drafts a valuation report and submits to the CGV shall not exceed 6 months.

## I noted that the valuation process for land and properties was not undertaken timely in

accordance with the compensation guidelines. I noted significant delays in the valuation

## process of properties for compensation of PAPs in the areas of Buikwe, Mukono,

Wakiso, and Jinja where, by the close of the year 2018/19, it had taken over 6 months

## and still the valuation had not yet been approved. The delayed compensations affect

the timely acquisition of land and subsequent project implementation.

---

The Accounting Officer explained that the Chief Government Valuer (CGV) guided that,

## due to lapse of time between earlier assessment of FY 2016/17 and delayed report

approval, there is a need for the draft reports to be revised using the new district compensation rates and current market land prices. The Ministry continues to engage

## the respective districts directly and through the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban

Development (MoLHUD) to fast track the approval process of the district compensation rates.

#### I advised the Ministry of Works and Transport to engage the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development to ensure that the process of surveying and mapping and

valuation is fast tracked for the project.

##### 4.5.2 Variances between budgeted and actual releases for PAPs

According to the Ministerial policy Statement approved budget estimates for the year

#### under review, Parliament appropriated a total of UGX 39.2 billion to enable the Ministry to implement its activities on the compensation of PAPs under the SGR project. However, only UGX.25 billion (64%) was released representing a shortfall of UGX. 14.2

billion (36%). This was attributed to inadequate budget allocations and budget cuts

## from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFPED).

## Compensation of PAPs was not undertaken in a timely manner, which impedes the

progress of the RAP implementation process. This may lead to PAPs contesting amounts in the valuation reports due to lapse of time resulting in further cost escalations.

## The Accounting Officer explained that the budget releases to the SGR project have

been used for project activities including, but not limited to; land compensation and project administration activities such as staff costs, rent, land acquisition related

#### expenditures and procurement of survey equipment. The Accounting Officer also explained that the Ministry has been making an effort to have additional funding to fast track the compensation of PAPs though with little success.

## I advised the Accounting officer to liaise with the relevant stakeholders to ensure

adequate disbursement of funds for compensations.

**4.5.3 Delays in payment of PAPs**  
The 2007 Guidelines on Compulsory Land Acquisition, Compulsory Land Acquisition

## Process Procedure No. 11 requires that with consideration to arbitration, compensation,

and resettlement, the period from the approval of the valuation report to payment of compensation awards shall not exceed 6 months.

I observed that out of the total approved 4,772 PAPs along with the districts of Tororo,

#### Iganga, Butaleja, Namutumba and Luuka with land and properties valued at UGX 137 billion, only 3,556 PAPs with claims of UGX 62 billion have been fully compensated. It was further noted that over 85% of these PAPs were awarded compensation in

financial year 2015/16 and to date, some have not yet been paid.

## Delays in compensation of PAPs pose a risk of increased costs of acquisition of the

Right of Way and lawsuits.

The Accounting Officer explained that the delays were due to inadequate budget allocations.

## I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the Ministry of Finance and lobby for

adequate resources to facilitate the timely implementation of the project.

##### Funds absorption and implementation of Projects at Mt. Elgon Labour Based

**Technology (MELTC) Training Centre**

**4.6.1 Projects fund absorption**

## The school implemented a number of projects during the year. It was however noted

## that most of these projects had not been planned. Furthermore, there were projects for

which funds were spent beyond the allocated amount while others did not exhaust the

## allocated funds. Details are in the table below:

| **Project Name** | **Release Amount (18/19) (UGX)** | **Spent (UGX)** | **Balances** **as** 18/19 (UGX)** **at** | **Audit Remarks** | **RESPONSES** |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Bridges to Prosperity | 595,580,000 | 720,039,891 | 124,459,891 | Expenditure higher than the allocation. | This is a five-year jointly funded project between GoU and B2P with balances and activities that straddle financial years. The unspent balance was a provisional amount to pay for materials on the Kibembe suspended bridge. The actual amount spent on Kibembe was UGX136,042,688 in FY 2019/20 |  
| Development Initiative for Northern Uganda | 372,410,000 | 406,777,044 | (34,367,044) | Expenditure was above what had been received. The school started spending way before funds had been  approved and therefore by the time the funds had come in, there was a projected deficit already. | The process to approve the first release to MELTC for DINU activities was delayed as a new Bank account had to be opened in BoU. The invitations for training had been sent out to the beneficiary districts already and cancellation would affect other scheduled training at MELTC. The second release from DINU to clear the deficit is expected in quarter 2 of FY 2019/20 |  
| Training of UNRA staff in road maintenance, LBT, and LCs | 540,428,999 | 395,340,388 | 145,088,611 | There was a project balance at the end of the training meaning they had over allocated funds the activity. | The t balance on this training arose because MELTEC had planned to train three groups. At the end of the FY, only two groups had been trained. The unspent balance was to cater to one of the 3 remaining groups to be trained. |  
| Training of Mid-Level contractors | 379,409,250 | 13,790,000 | 365,519,250 | Funds were not utilized. The project will commence in 2019/20 | The delayed absorption of the funds was caused by a delayed procurement process  that also involved a post- qualification evaluation of the prospective contractors for training. The activity was completed in quarter 1 of |  


---

|| FY 2019/20 |  
|---|---|  
| District Road Improvement projects | 391,110,000 | 393,910,000 | 2,800,000 | Funds were utilized with no substantial reports attached for the expenditure.  Works are still ongoing as per the progress reports. | The exercise was completed and the reports were submitted. |  
| Rolling out of low cost sealing | 106,843,004 | 142,979,004 | 36,136,000 | BoQs were developed and the civil works will commence in FY 2019/20. The project account was overdrawn as indicated. | The project account was overdrawn due to extra field activities that had to be undertaken to achieve the desired objective(s). This is still an ongoing project and the deficit will be recovered from the subsequent releases |  
| Training in constructing stone arch bridges | 300,000,000 | 118,502,625 | 181,497,375 | The activity was partially done. Training is scheduled for 2019/20. Under absorption observed. | The under absorption was occasioned by the need to train key stakeholders from MoWT and DLGs in the design and construction of low cost bridges under AfDB capacity building. Training of technical staff from DLGs at MELTC will commence in Quarter3 of FY 2019/20 |  
| Construction of ladders | 274,000,000 | 190,956,800 | 83,043,200 | Under absorption observed. | There was a delay in the completion of the Steel ladders due to heavy rains and poor access roads. However, the Steel ladders at Sigwa were completed and commissioned on 10 th October 2019. |  


## The excess expenditure and implementation of unplanned activities contravene financial

regulations and result in planned activities not being implemented.  
I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that activities are implemented in accordance with approved plans and budgets.

##### 4.6.2 Status of Project Implementation

## A review of the status of implementation of various projects at the training school

revealed that implementation of a number of projects had been delayed and some

## stalled. Details are provided in the table below.

| **Project Name** | **Objective** | **Amount Received (UGX)** | **Audit Remarks** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| Bridges Prosperity to | Construction  of suspended  cable footbridges across river crossing bottlenecks. | 595,580,000 | This is a five-year project and 10 footbridges were to be constructed in selected parts of the country. |  
| Development Initiative for Northern Uganda | Training technical and technical  from DLGs in North & North Eastern Uganda in LBT, staff | 372,410,000 | The project started late and will  to 2019/20. However, it should be noted that the budget had continue through |

## The delay in the implementation of the projects may lead to failure to achieve the

intended objectives.

## I advised the Accounting officer to review the implementation of the projects to address

the causes of these snags to ensure that the expected outputs under the various activities are achieved.

|---|---|---|  
| **1** | Rehabilitation/upgrading of the access road(3.1km) to Busoga College Mwiri in Jinja and paving the parking area at the central materials laboratory in Kireka, Kampala. | **Inadequate feasibility studies during design, and increased quantities;** Audit noted that the original geometric design was shifted at sections 1+150 to 1+410, and 1+600 to 1+700 with an intention of reducing on the earthworks as indicated in progress reports. It was however noted that the quantities of Cut to spoil, imported subgrade fill material, and stone pitching exceeded the original by 561%, 163.2%, and 31.2% respectively. This is a clear indicator that thorough investigations were not carried out at the design stage. |  
|^|^| **The omission of essential components in the contract;** Audit review of project bills of quantities, and inspection of the implemented project revealed that LHS road edge protection and guard rails were not provided for in the contract. |  
|^|^| **Expired Performance guarantee;** The extended performance guarantee expired on 24 th July 2019 and has not been renewed to-date. It should be noted that the contractor has not yet achieved substantial completion and still has outstanding works to implement. |  
|^|^| **The slow progress of works;** Review of Progress report of August 2019, revealed that the original project period of six (6) months had been extended by 15weeks. The audit noted that with the extension of 15 weeks, by 31 st July 2019, the progress of works was only 86.3%, against elapsed project time of 133.68%. |  
|^|^| **Inspection of Works;** some of the observations made included; Bleeding at Ch 0+030, Silted side drain at LHS of kakira access, Short side drain at LHS of kakira access, Poorly finished and failed stone pitching at end of Bugembe access LHS, Shrub Overgrown side drain on LHS of Iganga access affecting flow of water, Cracked access culvert line at 0+200 LHS, Washed/damaged stone pitching bases at several locations, Damaged end structures at several access culverts, Unconstructed outlet end structures on all cross culverts, Potholes developing at km 0+975 centreline, Stripping of second seal chippings at Ch 1+850 – Ch 1+950. |  
|^|^| **Quality of Works;** Audit undertook DCP tests, and noted that the Subbase layer passed, while there are some weak points in the base layer on the right-hand side of the road. The average CBR for the base layer is 68% on the LHS, and 54.26% on RHS. |  
|^|^| **Quantity Verification;** A comparison of the quantities of the items assessed by the audit team and those certified for payment revealed inconsistencies in some of the quantities of the measured items resulting in an overpayment of UGX.17,486,856 |  
|^|^| **Insufficient progress reports;** Review of availed project documentation revealed that out of the ten (10) reports expected on file, six had been prepared. |  
| **2** | Rehabilitation of Runga- Waaki-Butiaba road in Hoima district (Total | **Inadequate planning.** The contractor was denied access to the road section from km11+500 to 19+200 due to land acquisition and compensation issues. |
