1,Asphalt Concrete (AC20,"Grading, Passing Sieve (mm)",Average, ,The gradation fails to meet the tolerance requirement for the various sieves.,"The bitumen content as extracted is high. The mix is likely to bleed. In addition, the ITS test fails and this is likely to affect the durability of the asphalt layer."
