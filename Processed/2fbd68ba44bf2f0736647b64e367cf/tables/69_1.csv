13,(iii) Conformance of Audit Test Results to Specifications The audit team carried out in-situ concrete compressive strength tests on the kerbstones and walkway slabs. Laboratory tests on asphalt were also conducted. The results are shown in the following tables for all the 13 roads. The following were noted;  Gradation; All of the asphalt core samples tested failed on gradation as they were found to be either too fine or too coarse.  Bitumen Content; Most of the tested samples failed to meet the bitumen content requirements as the bitumen content was either too high or too low  Indirect Tensile Strength; All the asphalt concrete samples from all the 13 roads failed to meet the requirements of the specifications.  In-situ concrete compressive strength of kerbstones and walkway slabs was generally conforming to specifications. Generally 39 out of 90 tests (representing 43%) conducted met the Adequate attention was not paid to some parameters of asphalt mix design.  Use of a coarser/finer results into poor interlocking of the aggregates in the mix thus a porous pavement leading to ingress of moisture hence premature pavement, , , , , , , , , , The Municipali ty should consider undertaki ng further tests to assess the quality of asphalt concrete used and appropriat e
