0,"The management response was not accompanied by verifiable evidence in regard to the material test results particular to this project. Material test results of road projects implemented under USMID funding in the same financial year were seen on file but not for this URF project. The municipality may however present them for verification. (ii) Conformance of site works to design drawings and physical specifications Road width was checked for the two roads. The results are presented in the following table. From the table, it was established that the road width was slightly narrower than specified at two points on Amoz Obwona and at five points on Eronayo Oryema road. In addition the existing excavation for the u-drain was found to be insufficient for the designed size of the drain. Furthermore the thickness of the gravel base was not achieved at the three locations checked on Amoz Obwona road. No record was found on file about the change in design of the drain. - Delayed construction of the u-drain which has caused erosion of the vertical trench at edge of the surface dressing. - The dimensions of the drain excavation may have been found to be smaller due to change in design. - Failure to control levels when preparing the base layer. - Further delays in construction of the drain will cause further damage to the road which may require reconstruction of some sections. - The constructed pavement structure is inferior to the designed one which may cause early failure. - The Accounting Officer should always ensure that works are executed as per design drawings and physical specifications so as to ensure that the completed infrastructure performs as intended Amoz Obwona Road Items Chainage Unit Drawings/ Specifications Field checks/ measurements Conformity Road width 0+020 m 8.5 8.7 Ok; Junction 0+040 m 8.5 8.5 Ok 0+080 m 8.5 8.6 Not Ok; non-compliant with Clause 7304(b) of the Gen.
