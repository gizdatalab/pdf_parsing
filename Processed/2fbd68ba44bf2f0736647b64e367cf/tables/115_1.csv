0,"Management Response It is true, as noted by Auditors, we called one site meeting for all contract works going on at the same time (small local contracts) to avoid fatigue of meetings seeing their number. This is good management and all matters of concerning the contract were tackled. Audit Comment The contract sum of this perticuar project was UGX 977,861,939. It does not appear a “good management” practice to combine a site meeting for such a project with projects of less than UGX 100 Million. Contractual matters cannot be the same. (iii) Approved supervising personnel on site The Municipal Engineer was appointed as the contract supervisor (Project Manager) to supervise the works. N/A Ok Ok (iv) Approved equipment on site At the time of the audit, the major works of double surface treatment were complete, there were no site activities going on at the time, although the u-drain had been excavated. Materials and equipment for casting concrete had not been mobilised. Since there were no progress reports, the equipment used during works execution could not be verified. Absence of equipment hinders the progress of works thus delaying completion The Accounting Officer should put in place measures to ensure that contractors are always adequately mobilized in the course of execution of works Management Responses Noted for improvement.", , ,
