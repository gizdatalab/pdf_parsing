# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND

Government of Uganda represented by Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) is in the final stages of securing an additional financing facility of USD 360 million from the International Development Association (IDA/World Bank) to finance Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development-Additional Financing (USMID-AF) Program. In the Initial financial year (i.e. 2018/19), USMID\_AF shall be implemented in 18 municipalities in Uganda. The municipalities are Arua, Gulu, Lira, Soroti, Moroto, Tororo, Mbale, Jinja, Mbarara, Kabale, Fort Portal, Hoima, Entebbe , Masaka, Kitgum, Mubende, Kasese and Kamuli.

Accordingly, in the second year of the program 2019/2020, an additional 4 municipalities shall be identified and added to the program bringing the total number of USMID-AF participating municipal councils to 22. The USMID-AF program was expected to be effective by 1 st July 2018.  
One of the conditions of effectiveness of the program is for government to have in place complete annual performance assessment. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) requested the Auditor General to carry out a value for money audit/assessment for USMID and non USMID infrastructure projects implemented in the financial years 2016/17 and 2017/18 in the Municipalities that shall participate in the USMID-AF implementation during the financial years of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020.

The main objective of the audit was to undertake a Value for Money assessment of the delivery of urban infrastructure undertaken by the Municipal Councils participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development additional funding Program (USMID-AF). The scope of the assessment covered all USMID funded infrastructure and a selected number of non USMID financed infrastructure projects executed by the municipality and financed by Uganda Road Fund (URF) (force account) and Schools Facilities Grant (SFG) Projects in the Financial Years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. The general approach was to audit, for each Municipality and for each Financial Year, One (1) USMID Project and Six (6) Non-USMID Projects (3 URF Projects and 3 SFG Projects).

A participatory approach with the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD- USMID PST), Municipalities and World Bank was adopted. Project documents including planning estimates, designs, procurement files, works/ material supply contracts, progress reports, payment certificates, vouchers, quality control documents, correspondences and minutes of management meetings were reviewed. Field inspections were undertaken jointly with representatives of the Municipality for the selected projects to verify time, cost, quality, quantity and functionality of the civil works.

Performance was measured against a value for money assessment tool which was developed and discussed with the stakeholders. In the assessment, the scoring was as follows; economy-30%, efficiency-35% and effectiveness-35%. The scores for USMID and Non USMID infrastructure were then combined by having their scores weighted on a pro rata basis based on the cost of the infrastructure.

| **TOTAL** |<|| **43,784,159,507** | **100%** |  


In addition, the audit identified some areas that require improvement in order to strengthen the institutional capacity and improve urban infrastructure delivery at the municipalities in Uganda. This report presents the results of the assessment and the summary of the findings for the Financial Year 2017/2018. Chapter 2 presents the approach and methodology used for the assessment and Chapter 3 presents the findings per project in the municipality.

# RESULTS OF THE ASSESSMENT AND KEY FINDINGS

# Results of the Assessment

Based on the approach used and procedures performed, the assessment of economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the urban infrastructure was delivered by Moroto Municipal Council in the Financial Year 2017/18 yielded a weighted score of **69.98%** for the seven selected projects as presented in the table below;

# Economy Assessment

*Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

# Weighted Score 28.16 out of 30

Economy assessment related to an assessment of the unit cost of delivery of the infrastructure against works of similar nature, quality and quantity. In this assessment, selected Unit project item costs as per Engineers Estimates were compared, followed by comparison of Unit project item costs as per signed Contracts and, finally actual Unit cost per square meter of road works/buildings across the 18 Municipalities.

During the comparison of the engineer’s estimates and contractor’s rates across the Municipalities, five key items were assessed;-

- USMID funded Projects; precast concrete class 30 barrier kerbs, Clearing and Grubbing, CRR for Road Base, Asphalt Concrete for Surfacing, white lines broken or unbroken for road marking;
- SFG and DDEG projects; roofing area, 230mm walling, reinforced concrete, roofing timber and internal plaster.
- URF force account projects; 600mm concrete culverts, gravel, aggregates, cement and

## fuel



- URF contracted projects; 600mm culverts, concrete for drains, prime coat, first seal coat and gravel for sub-base.  
The weighted economy score of 28.16 out of 30 implies that there is a disparity in the engineer’s estimates, contractor/supplier rates and unit cost per square meter of infrastructure for USMID, SFG and URF projects across the Municipalities which requires the responsible authorities to address in the future.

# Efficiency A ssessment Weighted Score 23.74 out of 35

Efficiency assessment related to the assessment of the level of implementation of the works against the agreed contract approved work programs and outputs. This involved review of; progress of the works against time, existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works and contract Supervision and monitoring arrangements. The following parameters were assessed; physical progress lag, presence of detailed measurement sheets, payment above certified amounts, percentage of over payments, timeliness in payments, percentage of quality progress reports, presence of site meeting minutes, percentage of approved supervising personnel on site and percentage of approved equipment on site.  
The efficiency assessment for the Gulu Municipality revealed that as per the initial work program, the USMID project was behind schedule with a physical progress lag of 22.64% (as at 18 th August 2018 cumulative progress). However, following increase of the length of Laroo Road, a time extension was granted up to 20 th November 2018 and the contractor issued a notification of completion of works on 11 th October 2018. Whereas all the SFG/DDEG projects were completed within the scheduled timelines, audit observed that the contracted URF funded project failed to achieve the initially planned completion date of 30 th June 2018 and had an initial physical progress lag of 35%.

Detailed measurement sheets were prepared during certification of executed works for USMID funded project but not for SFG/ DDEG projects while for the URF funded project the measurement sheets were prepared for a few but not all items paid for in IPC No.1.Although actual payments on all projects were consistent with certified amounts, comparison of

vi

certified quantities with measured quantities revealed irregularities in measurements resulting in overpayments of UGX. 52,715,640 on the USMID projects. In addition, the audit noted a financial loss amounting to UGX 2,086,907,180 due to amendment of BOQ Item 42.01 for Asphalt concrete surfacing by the supervising consultant. A total of UGX. 24,236,100 was also overpaid to contractors on the non-USMID projects. The Municipality effected payments for all the non-USMID projects within the required timelines, however, payment of IPC No.4 to the USMID project contractor had been delayed by 12 days at the time of audit.  
The Municipality availed all the required number of detailed monthly progress reports for the USMID project However, for the non-USMID projects no detailed progress reports were prepared. It was further observed that whereas minutes of site meetings were prepared for the USMID project, meeting minutes particular to each respective non-USMID project were not prepared. For both the USMID and non-USMID projects, all the required supervising personnel had been mobilized. For the USMID project, the contractor had mobilized sufficient equipment required for timely delivery of the Project while for the contracted URF project no equipment was found on site yet concrete drainage works had not been completed. At the time of audit all SFG/DDEG projects had been completed thus no equipment was expected on site.  
The weighted efficiency score of 23.74 out of 35 reflects the challenges which Gulu Municipality still faces in supervision, progress monitoring, reporting, measurement and certification of executed works.

# Effectiveness Assessment Weighted Score 18.08 out of 35

Effectiveness involved assessment of the usage and quality of the infrastructural works undertaken by the municipalities. This involved the assessment of quality of works under implementation and the utilisation of infrastructure. The team assessed the following parameters; presence of material test results on file, percentage conformance of site works to design drawings and specifications, percentage of conformance of audit test results to specifications, presence of defects from visual observations and observed functionality and usage.  
The effectiveness assessment revealed that the Municipality undertook testing of construction materials used for the USMID project but not for non-USMID projects.  
On conformance to design drawings and specifications, the auditor noted few cases of non- conformance to design/ specifications on the USMID project especially in regard to road width and these were of minor nature; implying insignificant impact on the value for money. All asphalt cores revealed that the thicknesses were consistent with the design of USMID project. For non-USMID infrastructure projects minor deviations were also found especially on the sizes of doors and windows.  
An independent check on the quality of the infrastructure projects executed by the Municipality showed that for the USMID project, all the in-situ concrete strength of kerb stones and walkway slabs generally met the quality requirements. Laboratory tests on sampled asphalt concrete cores revealed that all the sampled asphalt concrete cores on all the 13 roads failed to meet both the gradation and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) requirements while the Bitumen Content of the sampled asphalt concrete cores on 12 of the 13 roads failed to meet the specified requirement as it was found to be either too high ot too low. For the URF project, CBR requirements expected for G30 material were met. In-situ

concrete tests could not be carried out on the SFG/DDEG structures since all concrete elements were already overlaid with cement-sand mortar finishes.  
Physical inspection of the works revealed a number of minor defects on both the USMID and non-USMID projects. Defects observed on the USMID project included among others; missing drain cover slab in isolated location, blocked drain inlets and generally silted rectangular drains arising from construction debris, Un-used road kerb materials abondoned on the walkways, manhole protruding above finished walkway level, broken access slab, damaged drainage gutter and poorly constructed joint with the access slab, ponding along road edge and drains intersecting covered rectangular drain having no provision to trap rubbish. For the URF project, erosion of vertical sides of the trench at edge of surface dressing and ponding of water in the drain trenches on both roads were noted. Minor defects such as cracks on the floor and poor screen finishes were observed on the SFG/DDEG projects.  
The USMID and URF infrastructure were open to traffic and functional. The SFG/DDEG projects had been completed and still in DLP awaiting commissioning. The score of 18.08 out of 35 reflects the challenges which Gulu Municipality still faces in material testing and implementing designs especially for non-USMID projects.

# Key Findings per Project

| **S/N** | **Project/Amount** | **General Findings** |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Construction works for Rehabilitation to Bitumen Standard of 13 roads (A total of 9.07km) under USMID Batch-2 [42,579,553,237] |  The engineer’s estimates for Gulu Municipality were on average 8% higher than the lowest rates for the items assessed across the municipalities in the cluster;   The contractor’s rates were the lowest for all the items assessed across the municipalities in the cluster;   The project’s unit cost per square meter is 1.09 times higher than that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of road works in the cluster   The works were to be executed over a period of 12 months from 14 th August 2017 to 14 th August 2018. Based on the previous physical progress performance established from the July 2018 reports, the estimated physical progress at audit time was 77.36%; thus implying a physical progress lag of 22.64%.   The completion date was extended from 14 th August 2018 to 28 th October 2018. On 11 th October 2018, the contractor issued notification of completion, ahead of the official date of 28 th October 2018 implying that there was no physical progress lag in respect to the revised work schedule.   Detailed measurement sheets were prepared and attached to the payment certificates.   There were no payments above certified amounts.   An overpayment of UGX 52,715,640.00 was made to the contractor for different pay items measured.   The BOQ Item 42.01 for Asphalt concrete surfacing was amended from a single item to be paid in square metres at a rate of UGX 44,840 to two items, one in cubic metres at a rate of 896,800 and the other (bitumen) in tonnes at rate of UGX 4,335,000. The new item for bitumen at UGX 4,335,000 per tonne translates to UGX |

| 24,130 per square metre. In effect, this change means that a square meter of completed Asphalt Concrete was delivered at UGX 68,970. Therefore, for the Revised BoQ total asphalt quantity of (4,324.3/0.05) = 86,486m 2 , the cost escalation amounts to 24,130\*86,486 = UGX 2,086,907,180 which is a possible financial loss   All payments to the consultant were made on time however payment of IPC No.4 to the contractor had been delayed by 12 days at the time of audit on 07 th August 2018.   All expected eleven progress reports were availed to the Auditors. The audit found the quality of progress reports generally meeting expectation.   The Supervision Consultant organised site meetings and prepared minutes which were signed by the Parties and the Consultant.   All the required supervising staff were mobilized and actively participating in the supervision.   The Contractor mobilised sufficient equipment required for timely delivery of the Project.   The project supervision team were undertaking routine quality checks on the materials used.   Generally, 99/138 checks undertaken (representing 71% of the checks conducted) conformed to the design/ specifications. All asphalt cores revealed thicknesses consistent with the design.   39/90 (representing 43%) of the audit tests carried out conformed to the specifications. The gradation and Indirect Tensile Strength of samples from all the 13 roads failed to meet the specifications.   Physical inspection of works revealed a number of minor defects some of which included; blocked drain inlets, broken access slabs, protruding manholes, missing drain cover slabs at isolated sections etc   At the time of audit, all the 13 roads were still under construction but most of them in advanced stages of completion. The roads were found to be functional.   The Municipal Environmental Officer and the Consultant participated in the monitoring of compliance to the environmental/ social safeguards on the Project. However audit observed that some workers did not have adequate PPE and in addition at numerous locations, manholes/ rectangular drains were left open in isolated locations without any barricades or warnings, some on completed walkways, posing safety hazard to pedestrians |  
| 2 | Rehabilitation of Amoz Obwona and Eronayo Oryema Roads.  [UGX 977,861,939] |  The engineer’s estimates for Gulu Municipality were generally on average1% higher than the lowest rates for the items assessed across all the municipalities;   The contractor’s rates for this project were on average 3% higher than the lowest rates for the items assessed across all the municipalities;   The project’s unit cost per square meter is 3.44 times higher than that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of contracted road sealing works across the 18 municipalities; |

# OVERALL AUDIT CONCLUSION

The assessment of economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which urban infrastructure was delivered by Gulu Municipal Council in the Financial Year 2017/2018 yielded a weighted score of 69.98%. The Municipality and the Supervising Consultant are generally managing the USMID project well. However, project management on non-USMID projects needs improvement in areas of progress reporting and monitoring, material testing, certification and measurement of works.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

# USMID Funded Infrastructure



1. The overpayment of UGX.52,715,640 should be recovered and quantity verification should always be keenly done to avoid over payments. The Municipality should consider undertaking further measurement of all work items.
2. The Accounting Officer should ensure that payment of IPCs and Fee Notes are effected timely in accordance with the signed contracts.
3. The municipality should undertake a re-evaluation of the splitting of item 42.01 for asphalt surfacing with the aim of recovering any costs additional to the original rate in the contract.
4. The Municipality should always ensure that payments to contractors are always effected within the stipulated contractual timelines so as to avoid interest claims due to delayed payments
5. The Municipality should consider undertaking further tests to assess the quality of asphalt concrete used and appropriate measures undertaken in the event quality requirements are not met. In addition, the Municipality should closely monitor the performance of the pavement and undertake appropriate action in the event of any failures.

*Value for Money Audit/assessment of the Municipalities participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development - Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*



6. The Municipality and the Supervision Consultant should ensure that poor quality materials are rejected and not incorporated into the works. In addition, all defects identified should be rectified.
7. Measures should be put in place to ensure that the requisite health and safety standards are always implemented by the contractor in the course of execution of the works.

# Non-USMID Funded Infrastructure



1. In order to address the wide disparity in the engineer’s estimates, contractor/supplier rates and unit cost per square meter of infrastructure, the responsible authorities should undertake a unit cost study to formulate standardised guidelines on preparation of cost estimates in Municipalities.
2. The municipality should always ensure that the contractors submit work programmes after contract signing within a period specified in the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC). In addition, revised work programmes should be submitted periodically as specified in the Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) or as soon as it is observed that the existing work programme has been rendered impractical to enable proper progress monitoring.
3. The Accounting officer should always ensure that works are measured during the certification process. Detailed measurement sheets for all items of work which have been approved and considered for payment should be prepared by the project manager and attached to the payment certificates.
4. All overpayments noted should be recovered.
5. The Municipality should ensure that detailed progress reports are prepared periodically, preferably on a monthly basis and filed on the contract management file. Comprehensive project completion reports should be prepared and filed. The reports should cover all project aspects including but not limited to physical and time progress, quality control, financial details, personnel, equipment used, weather conditions and summarised minutes of meetings.
6. The Municipality should avoid combining meetings of different contractors since some sensitive contractual matters cannot be discussed in general meetings.
7. The Accounting Officer should put in place measures to ensure that contractors are always adequately mobilized in the course of execution of works
8. The municipality should ensure that material tests are conducted for all projects to ensure conformance to quality requirements. These material test results should be kept on file, reported about in monthly progress reports and attached to payment certificates.
9. The Accounting Officer should put in place measures to ensure that works are executed as per design drawings and physical specifications so as to ensure that the completed infrastructure performs as intended.
10. All the defects observed should be rectified.

11. Environmental and social screening should be carried out for all projects, Environmental and Social Management Plan should be prepared. Monitoring of compliance to environmental and social impact safeguards should be done. Measures to preserve the health and safety of the contractor’s workers and the community at large should be enforced by the project supervisor and should be reported about in progress reports.

# CHAPTER ONE

# 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Article 163(3) of the 1995 Constitution of The Republic of Uganda requires the Auditor General (AG) to conduct Financial and Value for Money (VFM) Audits in respect of any project involving public funds. This mandate is further amplified by Section 21 of the National Audit Act (NAA) 2008 which gives the Auditor General powers to conduct financial and value for money audits for purposes of establishing economy, efficiency and effectiveness of any Ministry, Department or Agency (MDA), public organisation and any local government council.

Section 40 of the National Audit Act, 2008, empowers the Auditor General to engage the services of, or work in consultation with Professional or Technical Experts or Consultants whether in the public service or not, to enhance the performance of the OAG. Section III-part C (1) of the Financing Agreement for USMID Program provides for a Value for Money (VFM) audit starting with FY 2014/15 for the program activities under Disbursement Link Indicator 3 (DLI 3). In order to fulfil this condition, MLHUD requested the OAG to conduct a VFM audit on the infrastructure projects.

# 1.1 Background

Government of Uganda represented by Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) is in the final stages of securing an additional financing facility of USD 360 million from the International Development Association (IDA/World Bank) to finance Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development-Additional Financing (USMID-AF) Program. In the Initial financial year (i.e. 2018/19), USMID\_AF shall be implemented in 18 municipalities in Uganda. The municipalities are Arua, Gulu, Lira, Soroti, Moroto, Tororo, Mbale, Jinja, Mbarara, Kabale, Fort Portal, Hoima, Entebbe , Masaka Kitgum, Mubende, Kasese and Kamuli.

Accordingly, in the second year of the program 2019/2020, an additional 4 municipalities shall be identified and added to the program bringing the total number of USMID-AF participating municipal councils to 22. The USMID-AF program was expected to be effective by 1st July 2018.  
One of the conditions of effectiveness of the program is for government to have in place complete annual performance assessment. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) requested the Auditor General to carry out a value for money audit/assessment for USMID and non USMID infrastructure projects implemented in the financial years 2016/17 and 2017/18 in the Municipalities that shall participate in the USMID-AF implementation during the financial years of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020.

# 1.2 USMID Program Objective

The program development objective was to enhance institutional capacity of selected municipalities to address urban service delivery gaps.

# 1.3 Audit Objective

*Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

The main objective of the audit is to undertake a Value for Money assessment of the delivery of urban infrastructure undertaken by the Municipal Councils participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development additional funding Program (USMID-AF).  
The Specific objectives include:

1. Economy Assessment: This focused on the quantity, quality and unit cost of the infrastructure and making comparison with similar infrastructure design implemented in another municipality or sector.

2. Efficiency Assessment: This focused on the time taken to deliver a given quantity and quality of an infrastructure and included but was not be limited to:  
a. Evaluation of the level of implementation of works against agreed contract timelines  
b. Evaluation of existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works.  
c. Review of contract supervision and monitoring arrangements and recommend measures needed to address shortcomings in execution of the contracts.
3. Effectiveness Assessment: This focused on the extent to which the works carried out were delivered with the intended quality and meet the intended purpose and usage.



# 1.4 Audit Scope

The audit focused on the USMID project and a sample of other non-USMID financed projects undertaken in the FY 2017/2018 based on the work plan.

# 1.5 Selection of Projects

Projects were selected from the infrastructure projects undertaken by the Municipality in the financial year under review. Generally, for each municipality, the USMID funded project was selected in addition to six (6) non-USMID projects where applicable. Selection of the non-USMID projects was based on the following agreed criteria:

## i.

Funding arrangements – projects were selected based on the funding arrangements of Uganda Road Fund (URF) and SFG. These funding arrangements were based on the fact they cut across all the participating municipalities.  
ii. Materiality – projects with higher implementation amounts were considered in preference to those with lower costs.

## iii.

Type of infrastructure – projects were selected based on two categories i.e. road and building works..

Under this criterion, seven (7) projects were selected for audit review comprising one (1) USMID project, one (1) URF (Contracted) project, two (2) SFG projects and three (3) DDEG projects. The following table shows projects selected and their corresponding weights for Gulu Municipality, in the Financial Year 2017/18.

# CHAPTER TWO

# 2.0 AUDIT METHODOLOGY

The audit was carried out in accordance with the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Performance Auditing Standards and Value for money (VFM) Auditing guidelines prescribed in the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) VFM audit manual.  
The standards require that the audit is planned in a manner which ensures that an audit of high quality is carried out in an economic, efficient and effective way and in a timely manner.  
The audit was based on a Value for Money (VFM) assessment tool that evaluated economy, efficiency and effectiveness to ensure attainment of the specific audit objectives. This tool was developed in consultation with USMID Program Support

## Team and the World Bank.

# 2.1 Assessment of Economy

Economy assessment related to an assessment of the unit cost of infrastructure and made comparisons with similar quantity and quality of infrastructure implemented in other municipalities.  
Economy assessment related to a comparison of the following parameters derived from Gulu Municipality with the lowest among the 18 Municipalities;

- Selected unit item costs as per engineer’s estimates
- Selected unit item costs as per the works contracts
- Unit cost per square meter of works. In the assessment of the unit cost per square metre for road works, Preliminary and general items, and earthworks were excluded while for buildings, only Preliminary and general items were excluded.  
The documents reviewed for this assessment included but were not limited to; Engineers’ estimates, works contracts, material supplies contracts, and force account planning documentation.

# 2.2 Assessment of Efficiency

In the assessment of efficiency the following was undertaken:

## i.

An assessment of the progress of works against time; this was assessed by determining the physical progress lag as the difference between the planned physical progress and actual physical progress as at the time of audit.  
ii. An evaluation of the existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works; this was assessed by checking for the availability of detailed measurement sheets, comparison of certified amounts with the amounts paid out, quantity verification through comparison of certified quantities with measured quantities, assessing timeliness of payments by determining any delays in the payment for executed works/services and materials supplied.  
iii. A review of the contract supervision and monitoring arrangements; In undertaking this review, an assessment was made of the number and quality of

21

*Value for Money Audit/assessment of the Municipalities participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development - Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

progress reports prepared, availability of minutes of site meetings, comparison of approved supervising personnel with personnel involved in the supervision of the works and comparison of approved equipment with equipment found on site.  
The documents reviewed for this assessment included; works contracts, consultancy contracts, payment certificates, fee notes and vouchers, measurement sheets, time sheets, work programs, progress reports, minutes of site meetings, material delivery notes, material supplies contracts, force account planning documentation, among others.  
Field inspections and measurement of some of the executed works was undertaken and quantities of sampled works measured were compared to respective quantities certified for payment so as to assess the valuation of the works.

# 2.3 Assessment of Effectiveness

The assessment focused on the quality and usage of the infrastructural works undertaken by the municipalities. The following were undertaken;  
i. An assessment of the quality of works under implementation; this was assessed by checking for the presence of material test results, comparing site works to the design requirements, comparing audit material test results of sampled items to specifications and visually checking for the presence of any defects on the works.

## ii.

An assessment on the utilisation of the infrastructure; this involved undertaking site visits to assess the usage and functionality of the infrastructure.

## iii.

An assessment of the level of compliance with the environmental and social impact safeguards. The implementation of health and safety requirements on the active sites and the report on the same was considered  
The documents reviewed for this assessment included; materials test results, works contracts, design reports/drawings, specifications among others. Field inspections were undertaken for each of the projects to assess the condition and functionality of the infrastructure, check for defects, carry out in-situ tests and collect samples for laboratory tests for comparison with specifications and the reported results.

*Value for Money Audit/assessment of the Municipalities participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development - Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

# Clustering of USMID funded Projects

Clustering of USMID funded projects was carried out and four (4) clusters were made. The clusters were as follows;

1. Hoima, Fort portal, Mbarara

## 2. Mbale, Tororo and Soroti

3. Moroto, Gulu, Arua and Lira



## 4. Jinja, Masaka and Entebbe.

To ensure fair assessment in respect to the unit cost of projects, a sub-cluster constituting USMID projects for construction of taxi/bus parks in Moroto, Arua, Fortportal, and Entebbe was created to specifically compare the unit cost of building construction works funded under USMID.

# Clustering of SFG and DDEG Projects;

Clustering of the SFG and DDEG funded projects was done as follows;

- Projects with contract sums more than 50 million
- Projects with contract sums between 25 and 50 million
- Projects with contract sums less than 25 million  
The SFG and DDEG building projects were distributed as shown in following table across the 18 municipalities.

To ensure fair assessment in respect to the unit cost of projects, sub-clusters were created for Force Account road sealing and gravelling projects. The lowest unit cost of the projects was determined basing on the contract rates of major inputs i.e Gravel (for gravelling projects) and Chippings (for road sealing projects). For the Financial Year 2017/2018, the contract rates for gravel were categorized as follows;

- UGX 15,000 and Below;
- Between UGX 15,000 to UGX 30,000;
- UGX 30,000 and above.  
Likewise, the contract rates for chippings were categorized as follows;

- UGX 150,000 and Below;
- Between UGX 150,000 to UGX 300,000;
- UGX 300,000 and above.

# 2.6 Weighting

Weighting of the projects was done to cater for financial risks associated with the projects giving consideration to infrastructure with a bigger monetary value. Thus the weighting was done pro-rata to the costs of the infrastructure selected for assessment, using the formula below;  
W =P /Σ(P  
) where W is the weight for project x, P is the project cost and N is x x 1,2..,N x x  
the number of projects selected.

**3.1.4 Assessment of Economy**

# The score for economy was 28.4 out of 30 as detailed below; a) 0.+

### i) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the USMID projects in the participating Municipalities within the cluster of Moroto, Gulu, Arua and Lira and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. Gulu engineer’s estimates were compared against lowest engineer’s rates for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

*Value for Money Audit/assessment of the Municipalities participating in the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development - Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

The Municipality scored **4.67 out of 5.** The engineer’s estimate rates for the 5 items were on average 8% higher than the lowest for the 5 items assessed across municipalities.

# Management response

It is crucial to establish the origin of the lowest rate being used. In some cases, it is obvious the reference rate is either too old or was never realistically developed. For example, CRR at 117,040 needs to be assessed considering that overall, a ton of CRR costs min 50,000 in commercial quarries. A compacted m 3 requires almost 1.7tons, transport, equipment personnel etc all of which cannot fit within the 117,040 rate.

# Audit Comment

This is noted. The Government ought to develop unit rates data bases for guiding its entities.

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of the contractors’ rates for all the USMID projects in the participating municipalities within the cluster of Moroto, Gulu, Arua and Lira and the lowest contractor’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the lowest among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in table the table below;

# iii) Comparison of Unit Cost Per Square Meter of Works

A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of infrastructure for all the USMID projects in the participating municipalities in the cluster and the lowest unit cost per square metre was identified. A comparison of the project unit cost per square meter was made against the lowest exclusive of earthworks among the participating municipalities in the cluster. The results of the assessment are presented in table below;

### Table 3.1-4: Comparison of Project Unit Costs across Municipalities

| **Cost Per Square Meter of Road (F) (UGX)** | **Lowest Cost Per Square Meter of Road Among Municipalities** **(F** m** **) (UGX)** | **Score** **(15\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Proportion of the Project Unit Cost to the Lowest** **(1+(F-F** m** **)/F** m** **)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| **Earth Works Excl.** | **Earth Works Excl.** | **Earth Works Excl.** | **Earth Works Excl.** |  
| 538,827 | 493,290 | **13.73** | **1.09** |  


The Municipality scored 13.73 out of 15 in comparison to lowest cost per square metre of road works excluding earth works. The project’s unit cost per square meter is therefore 1.09 times that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of road works.

# Management Response

The municipalities in cluster-1 had same rates. Maybe the difference was brought about by Moroto but Moroto did not have a road under this batch. This comparison needs to be broken further to actually compare likes. A road say in Moroto may not have had asphalt as surfacing nor CRR as base. So it is important to ensure that the roads being compared have comparable structures and amenities.

# Audit Comment

Moroto municipality was not considered in the assessment of the unit cost per square meter.

| **(a)**  **Assessment of progress of works against time**  **(i)** Assessment of physical progress lag basing on initial work** **programme**  The works were to be executed over a period of 12 months from 14 th August 2017 to 14 th August 2018.  The original work programme was not accompanied with cash flow and progress projections for the project duration.  The progress report for the month of July 2018 indicates that, at 31 st July 2018 when nearly 100% progress should have been attained (expiry due on 14 th August 2018), the actual cumulative progress stood at 74.06%. Assessment of the physical progress figures reported in the July 2018 progress report reveals that at the end of July 2018, the monthly progress rate was 7.08% (increased from 66.98% to 74.06% from June to July 2018). The cumulative progress as at 18 th August 2018 can therefore be projected as 74.06 + (7.08/30)\*14 = 77.36%; thus implying a physical progress lag of 22.64%.  **Management Response**  By start of July 2018, the instruction for extension of Laroo had already include works on the extension and as such it is wrong to only limit the extension.

By the time of the audit on 07 th August 2018, the time extension approval was awaited.

### Management Response

UGX.52,715,640 is recovered from the contractor

The works were ongoing and generally certification of works in progress always has minor deviation in the proceeding certification. GCC 42.1 recognises this by referring to interim certifications as ESTIMATES. What is important however is that the small deviations are corrected in subsequent certification as required in GCC 42.6

Following are the auditor’s findings of review of the payment documents on file:   The Works Contract provides that the Employer shall pay Contractor’s IPC within 30 days of receipt and certification by the Project Manager;   The Contractor submitted an Advance Payment request and 4 IPCs No. 1, 2, ….., 4. The Employer paid the advance timely. Similarly, the IPCs No 1, 2 and 3 were paid timely. However, by the time of the audit on 07 th August 2018, the IPC No.4, which was submitted on 26 th June 2018, was not yet paid and had already been delayed by 12 days.   The Consultancy Contract provides that the Employer shall pay Consultant’s Invoice within 30 days of receipt of the Invoice.   Certification and payment records for Fee Note No.1 were not seen by the Auditors. Consultant’s Fee Notes No.2 and No. 3 were paid timely.   From the foregoing, the Auditor notes that NOT all payments are within the contractual provision; the Contractor’s IPC No.4 was still in delay by the time of the Audit. || Contractor’s  cash flows which may negatively impact  on delivery of their contractual obligations to the Municipality; \- Could lead to accumulation of interest  on delayed payments and possible  disputes | payment of IPCs and Fee Notes are effected timely within 30 days in accordance with the signed contracts. The Government’s IFMS’s failures should be addressed to resolve negative  impacts associated with delays in payments of providers. |

| **Item No.** | **Description** | **Unit** | **Rate (UGX)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 42.01 | 50mm, 60/70 penetration bitumen with 20mm maximum aggregate | Sq.M | 44,840 |  


Usually, when A/Concrete is paid in Sq.M of finished layer of stated thickness, the rate per Sq.M is inclusive for furnishing the bitumen specified, save for any variation between the specified bitumen content and the actual instructed one. The Auditor did not see any record on file where the Contractor disputed this item in the original contract BoQ and the matter seems was never contested throughout the procurement process.  
However, during the Design Review, the Supervision Consultant split the Item 42.01 into two sub-items 42.01(a) and 42.01(b) as shown in the table inset below.

| **Item No.** | **Description** | **Unit** | **Rate (UGX)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 42.01(a) | 50mm, 60/70 penetration bitumen with 20mm maximum aggregate | Cu.M | 896,800 |  
| 42.01(b) | 60/70 penetration grade bitumen for asphalt concrete surfacing | ton | 4,335,000 |  


The new item for bitumen at UGX 4,335,000 per tonne translates to UGX 24,130 per Sq.M (@ 4.5% bitumen content and 2474 Kg/m3 A/Concrete density, typically).

| In effect, this change means that a square meter of completed Asphalt Concrete shall be delivered at UGX 44,840 + 24,130 = UGX 68,970. Therefore, for the Revised BoQ total quantity of (4,324.3/0.05) = 86,486m 2 , there will be cost escalation of 24,130\*86,486 = UGX 2,086,907,180 which is a financial loss. The Contractor’s quoted price of UGX 44,840/m 2 may appear low but the Contractor could have, at the time of tender, allowed for any difference in other rates elsewhere in the Contract. Specific proof should have been sought that the Contractor’s original rate for a square meter of completed asphalt concrete in Item 42.01 was exclusive of bitumen.  **Management Response**  The Design Consultant (DC) made the BoQ item 42.01(a)  dusts and aspalt.

| So it was a case of missing item(bitumen) rather than splitting. Missing items cannot be regarded as savings.  **Otherwise, this would easily have turned into an arbitratable dispute which the contractor would have easily won.** **It is not true that road widths were reduced to manage price escalation as reported by the audit team. The road widths recommended in the design review were moslty dictated by available road space. Bitumen was never a deciding factor.** Moreover in most cases (over 80% of the contract length), the road widths were increased during design review. For example Laroo, which is the longest of the batch at 2.49km, was supposed to be 11.0m total width with only 6m wide carriageway was changed to 14m total constructed with 9m carriageway. Peter Paul Opok and Alex ojera roads were supposed to be 10 and 12.5m total constructed widths respectively and were made 14m at design review. Others were 0.6km of Nyerrere changed from 10m to 14m, Golf course from 13m to 14m, Lasto okech from 10m to 14m, Odida from 10m to 14m, Okwera from 15m to 15m, Tank from 12m to 14m. |<|<|<|  
| **Audit Comment**  The management response is trying to hide the bitumen factor from the description of the Original Item 42.01 in the Contract. The Item, for clarity, states as follows: “42.01 **ASPHALT CONCRETE SURFACING ; (a) 50mm, 60/70 penetration bitumen with 20mm maximum aggregate”.** Indication in the description of this item is that bitumen is inclusive; and the fact that the Contractor did not raise any reservations at tender, contract negotitation, etc, until it was prompted by the Design Review Consultant; suggests that the Contractor could have been aware that the asphalt concrete which was supposed to be furnish per square meter was inclusive of the specified bitumen. The fact that, after being requested, the Contractor submitted a rate breakdown indicating that the original rate was excluding bitumen is obvious expectation from a contractor.  The Auditor also notes misrepresentation of facts in the management response regarding changes in road widths. Data in Table 3-2 of the Design Review Report, Page 24, indicates that the widths of 6 roads out of 13 roads were slightly increased whereas as for 7 out of 14 roads, the widths were reduced, substantially for some; e.g., for Nyerere Rd and Sir Samuel Baker Rd, the widths were reduced from 21m to 14m and from 17m to 14m respectively. Also, parking lanes on 6 roads were eliminated and left on only 1 road. The width of Laroo road was never increased; the paved surface is 9m and overall width is 14m. |<|<|<|

| **(iii) Conformance of Audit Test Results to Specifications**  The audit team carried out in-situ concrete compressive strength tests on the kerbstones and walkway slabs. Laboratory tests on asphalt were also conducted. The results are shown in the following tables for all the 13 roads. The following were noted;   Gradation; All of the asphalt core samples tested failed on gradation as they were found to be either too fine or too coarse.   Bitumen Content; Most of the tested samples failed to meet the bitumen content requirements as the bitumen content was either too high or too low   Indirect Tensile Strength; All the asphalt concrete samples from all the 13 roads failed to meet the requirements of the specifications.   In-situ concrete compressive strength of kerbstones and walkway slabs was generally conforming to specifications.  Generally 39 out of 90 tests (representing 43%) conducted met the Adequate attention was not paid to some parameters of asphalt mix design.  Use of a coarser/finer results  into poor interlocking of the aggregates in the mix thus a  porous pavement leading  to ingress  of moisture hence premature pavement |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  The Municipali ty should consider undertaki ng further tests to assess the quality of asphalt concrete used and appropriat e |

### Finding Cause Implication Recommendation

# Audit Comment

Low ITS could be attributed to inadequate compaction, formation of micro cracks during early cooling of materials or low bitumen affinity and poor bonding of bitumen to the aggregates. A low indirect tensile strength makes the pavement susceptible to longitudinal cracking, moisture related deterioration and rutting. The performance of the pavement should be closely monitored during the defects liability period and beyond as recommended above.

### (iv) Physical inspection to ascertain any defects

The auditors inspected the project roads on 10 th and 11 th August 2018 in the presence of the Supervising Consultant’s Staff. At the time of audit, all the 13 roads were still under construction but most of them in advanced stages of completion. Asphalt concrete paving was already completed on 10 roads and on-going on 1 road. Two roads had already been primed; of which one was already being cleaned for asphalt works. The following were observed, road – by - road:

### 1: Field observations on Sir Samuel Baker Road (1.28km)

Sir Samuel Baker Road is a two lane single carriageway road with a cycle lane on both LHS and RHS and raised walkway on both sides. At the time of the audit, the entire road was at prime coat level; cleaning in preparation for asphalt was in progress; kerbing and drainage were completed; walkways works were being finalised. Street lighting works was in progress. The road camber and kerb alignment appearance was good. The primed base surface appeared intact with no locations requiring repairs prior to asphalt concrete surfacing. The following were however observed that require attention:  
 Km 0.240 LHS: Damaged cement blocks (mainly with edge breaks) were  
being used to construct manhole

that there is proper management and handling of construction materials to maintain their quality at delivery at site, in respect the damaged materials should be rejected and not incorporated into the works.

### Management Response

All the damaged cement blocks were not used and were removed from site during cleanup. The Contarctor was instructed to increase care and handling in loading and off-loading of cement blocks to prevent their edges from getting damaged.

### Audit Comment

The fact that such materials were found by the auditors being used in the works means that there was laxity in the quality control and assurance system, a reason to call for vigilance of the teams on the Project.

Asphalt concrete paving was already completed on 10 roads and on-going on 1 road. Two roads had already been primed; of which one was already being cleaned for asphalt works. All the roads which were already paved with asphalt were opened to traffic and were functioning despite lack of road furniture such as traffic signs and road marking; the volume of traffic was noted to be low and without flow constraints at all. The roads which were under construction were carrying controlled traffic flow as per the project’s traffic management plans. Obstructions were however observed on many of the roads’ walkways interrupting pedestrian movement.

# The score on economy was 19.06 out of 30 as detailed below; (a) Assessment of the price difference between similar quality and quantity of works

### i) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the URF projects executed by contractors under supervision of the municipality in all the Municipalities and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu engineer’s rates was made against the lowest engineer’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.2-2: Comparison of Engineers Estimates across Municipalities

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of contractors’ rates for all the URF projects executed by contractors under supervision of the municipality in all the Municipalities and the lowest contractor’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the lowest contractor’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

The Municipality scored 9.75 out of 10. The contractor’s rates for this project were generally on average 3% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the 18 municipalities. This could be attributed to the following;

- Contractor’s pricing strategy;
- Prevailing market prices of items at the time of bidding;
- Geographical location of the municipality in comparison to proposed material sources.

# Management Response

*Value for Money Audit/assessment of the Municipalities participating in the Uganda Support toMunicipal Infrastructure Development - Additional Funding (USMID-AF) program*

The Municipality scored 4.36 out of 15. The project’s unit cost per square meter is 3.44 times higher than that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of contracted road sealing works across the 18 municipalities. This could be attributed to the quoted prices provided by the contractor.

# Management response

I would like to believe that, the comparision may be unfair as specifications, made of constructions, etc are not uniform. These projects were designed and specified by the individual municipality. Expertice of the Engineers therefore defers. But the standard of our URF roads proves that we must be fairly expensive to attain higher quality than the rest.

# Audit Comment

Several items were deducted from the contract sum of this project to ensure fair comparison with contracted road sealing works elsewhere. The deductions included; Preliminaries, Drainage bill items for both Roads, Excavation to spoil, Rock excavation to spoil, Clearing and grubbing, Removal of existing culverts, earthworks for fill, Ancillary Works and Day work rates.

However, on 2 nd May 2018, the contractor requested for time extension up to 30 th September 2018 which was granted on 8 th May 2018. Therefore works were incomplete at the expiry of initial time of completion.

### Management Response

Overpayment does not arise as measurement sheets where made and attached to payment. Audit alleged that there was overpayment of about 0.8% which is negligible. The truth is the contract amount was not exceeded either. So this allegation is not true.

### Audit Comment

Overpayments have little to do with whether the contract sum was exceeded or not; They arise from measurement quantities of individual items.

**(iv) Timeliness in Payments** N/A Ok Ok Details of the payments are shown in the table following. As

| **Management Response**  It is true, as noted by Auditors, we called one site meeting for all contract works going on at the same time (small local contracts) to avoid fatigue of meetings seeing their number. This is good management and all matters of concerning the contract were tackled.  **Audit Comment**  The contract sum of this perticuar project was UGX 977,861,939. It does not appear a “good management” practice to combine a site meeting for such a project with projects of less than UGX 100 Million. Contractual matters cannot be the same.  **(iii) Approved supervising personnel on site**  The Municipal Engineer was appointed as the contract  supervisor (Project Manager) to supervise the works. N/A Ok Ok **(iv) Approved equipment on site**  At the time of the audit, the major works of double surface treatment were complete, there were no site activities going on at the time, although the u-drain had been excavated. Materials and equipment for casting concrete had not been mobilised. Since there were no progress reports, the equipment used during works execution could not be verified. Absence of equipment hinders the progress of works thus delaying completion The Accounting Officer should put in place measures to ensure that contractors are always adequately mobilized in the course of execution of works **Management Responses** Noted for improvement. |<|<|<|

The municipality may however present them for verification. **(ii) Conformance of site works to design drawings and** **physical specifications**  Road width was checked for the two roads. The results are presented in the following table.  From the table, it was established that the road width was slightly narrower than specified at two points on Amoz Obwona and at five points on Eronayo Oryema road. In addition the existing excavation for the u-drain was found to be insufficient for the designed size of the drain. Furthermore the thickness of the gravel base was not achieved at the three locations checked on Amoz Obwona road.

### Management Response



- At the time of Audit, the contract period was still on and the ongoing work was caonstruction of drainage chanel. This was as per the contractor’s program and it did not affect completion time neither was the work spoiled for delay.
- Audit noted there were smaller variation in with of ranging from 0.1m to 0.2m ie (100m to 200mm). this normal and negiglegible as it did not affect the project cost. It is compensated by thickness of the concreret drainage walls which is more than specified by that average.

### (iii) Conformance of Audit Test Results to Specifications

DCP tests were conducted on Amoz Obwona road and the in-situ -  
Ok Ok CBR was determined at different points along the road. The  
results obtained as shown in the following table show that the  
CBR requirements expected for G30 material were met.

| **(iv) Physical inspection to ascertain presence of defects**  The auditors inspected works on 14 th August 2018 in the presence of the Engineering Staff from Gulu Municipal Engineer’s Office. The second seal had just been placed about two weeks ago and excavation for the u-drain had been done. There was no activity at site but the contractor’s site manager was present. The following were observed during the inspection;  Eroding vertical sides of the trench at edge of surface dressing  and ponding of water in the drain trenches for both roads Erosion of the edges and ponding of water Delayed concrete works of the drain. The contractor informed the audit team that they are waiting for metallic formwork which is to be hired from somewhere else. Risk of further damage to the road which may necessitate reconstruction of some sections. The Municipality should ensure that the contractor executes the concrete works as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the road. **Management Response**  It should be noted that work is a process. Depending on how the contractor makes his program. In this case, the storm side drain was the last to be made. And it was excavated and left and attended to. It was completed successfully.  **Eronayo Oryema Road**  Blocked trench; Some residents have blocked the excavated  trench at some points to create access to their homes as shown  in the following photographs. Delayed concrete works of the drain and access slabs. Risk of ponding and subsequent failure of the vertical excavation.

Other things are, we use the manufacturers’ specifications eg. Reinforcement bars, cements, iron sheets. These are very sufficient for the local projects with limited funding for administrative cost.  **Audit Comment**  The management response was not accompanied by verifiable evidence in regard to the material test results for building construction projects.

**3.4.4 Assessment of Economy**

# The score on economy was 22.76 out of 30 as detailed below; (a) Assessment of the price difference between similar quality and quantity of works i)

### Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the SFG (and where applicable DDEG) projects in all the municipalities and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu’s engineer’s rates was made against the lowest engineer’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.4-2: Comparison of Engineers Estimates across Municipalities

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **3.05** | **Average = 198%** |  


The Municipality scored 3.05 out of 5. The engineer’s estimates were on average 98% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the local conditions and pricing of items at the time of estimation.

# Management response

Our rates looks high; this could be the rulling market prices in the Town. Municipal Council may have limited effort to control prices developed by the contractors.

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of contractors’ rates for all the SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest contractor’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the lowest contractor’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items.

The Municipality scored 5.87 out of 10. The contractor’s rates for 4 out of 5 items were higher than the lowest rates. Generally, the contractor’s rates were on average 103% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the following;

- Contractor’s pricing strategy;
- Prevailing market prices of items at the time of procurement;
- Geographical location of the municipality in comparison to proposed material sources.

# iii) Comparison of unit cost per square meter of works

A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of infrastructure for all SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest unit cost per square metre was identified. A comparison of Gulu project unit cost per square meter was made against the lowest unit cost per square metre among the Municipalities. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.4-4: Comparison of Project Unit Costs

| **Cost per Square Meter of Building Works (F) (UGX)** | **Lowest Cost per Square Meter of Building Works Among Municipalities (F m** **) (UGX)** | **Score** **(15\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Proportion of the Project Unit Cost to the Lowest** **(1+(F-F** m** **)/F m** **)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 636,148 | 586,886 | **13.84** | **1.08** |  


The Municipality scored 13.84 out of 15. The project’s unit cost per square meter is 1.08 times higher than that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of building works of similar scope across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the quoted prices provided by the contractor.

# Management response

Audit should take keen interest in the analysis of rates: eg. It is not possible that building a wall should cost UGX 10,000 per m 2 Or that plaster should cost only UGX

## 5,000.

And Roofing sheets G28; GMC uses prepainted sheets, what about others.?

# Audit Comment

It is next to impossible to find several projects with the exact same scope of works, size and specifications. Audit therefore clustered projects of “nearly” similar scope as described in Section 2.5 of this report.

The same is required for an admeasure contract adopted for this project. Measurement sheets corresponding to the payment certificates were neither attached to the certificates nor availed to the auditors for verification. In the absence of these, the audit team could not ascertain whether the Municipality undertook measurement of works during the process of certification. Non-measurement of works can lead to the risk of overpayments. | Inadequate attention to proper good management practices and contract administration. | Non-measurement of works exposes the Municipality to the risk of loss of funds  through overpayments to the contractor. | The Accounting officer should ensure that the project manager takes measurements for works during execution.

**3.5.4 Assessment of Economy**

# The score on economy was 23.14 out of 30 as detailed below; (a) Assessment of the price difference between similar quality and quantity of works i)

### Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the SFG (and where applicable DDEG) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu engineer’s rates was made against the lowest engineer’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.5-2: Comparison of Engineers Estimates across Municipalities

| **Bill Item** | **Unit** | **Eng. Est. Rate (F) UGX** | **Lowest rate among municipalities** **(F** m** **) UGX** | **Score** **(1\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Percentage of Engineer’s Rate to the Lowest** **(1+(F-**  **F** m** **)/F** m** **)%** |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Roofing Sheets (gauge 28) | m 2 | 38,500 | 18,500 | 0.48 | 208% |  
| Internal Plaster | m 2 | 10,000 | 5,000 | 0.50 | 200% |

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **2.27** | **Average = 240%** |  


The Municipality scored 2.27 out of 5. The engineer’s estimates were on average 140% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the local conditions and pricing of items at the time of estimation.

# Management response

Auditors should revise their analysis of some of the unit rates: eg. 230mm walls, internal plaster 1:4, reinforced concrete 1:2:4 Agg/20. The lowest rates are haphazardly low. But all these rates were provided by the individual firms who controls the market out there.

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of contractors’ rates for all the SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest contractor’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the lowest contractor’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **8.25** | **Average = 125%** |  


The Municipality scored 8.25 out of 10. Generally, the contractor’s rates were on average 25% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the following;

- Contractor’s pricing strategy;
- Prevailing market prices of items at the time of procurement;
- Geographical location of the municipality in comparison to proposed material sources.

# Management response

Rates for some municipalities are harphazardly low, eg. Reinforced concrete

# iii) Comparison of unit cost per square meter of works

A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of infrastructure for all SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest unit cost per square metre was identified. A comparison of Gulu project unit cost per square meter was made against the lowest unit cost per square metre among the Municipalities. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.5-4: Comparison of Project Unit Costs

|---|---|---|---|  
| 545,686 | 545,686 | **15.00** | **1.00** |  


The Municipality scored 15 out of 15. The project’s unit cost per square meter is the lowest unit cost per square meter of building works of similar scope across all the municipalities.

It is true, material tests were not on file for each SFG project. However, some material tests for aggregates and sand are on the road files as the sources are the same. Other things are, we use the manufacturers’ specifications eg. Reinforcement bars, cements, iron sheets. These are very sufficient for the local projects with limited funding for administrative cost.

### Audit Comment

Manufacturer’s certificates were not seen. It is good practice to keep a complete project management file covering all project aspects.

### Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the SFG (and where applicable DDEG) projects in all the municipalities and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu’s engineer’s rates was made against the lowest engineer’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.6-2: Comparison of Engineers Estimates across Municipalities

| **Bill Item** | **Unit** | **Eng. Est. Rate (F) UGX** | **Lowest rate among municipalities** **(F** m** **) UGX** | **Score** **(1\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Percentage of Engineer’s Rate to the Lowest** **(1+(F-**  **F** m** **)/F** m** **)%** |

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **3.05** | **Average = 198%** |  


The Municipality scored 3.05 out of 5. The engineer’s estimates were on average 98% times higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the local conditions and pricing of items at the time of estimation.

# Management Response

Audit should revisit their mode of analysis on 230mm walling, Internal plaster. However we shall review the market analysis for improvement.

# Audit Comment

Unreasonably low rates were eliminated from the assessment. Much lower rates than the ones presented were not included.

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of contractors’ rates for all the SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest contractor’s rates for the selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **6.02** | **Average = 191%** |  


The Municipality scored 5.62 out of 10. The contractor’s rates were on average 91% higher than the lowest rates for the items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the following;

- Contractor’s pricing strategy;
- Prevailing market prices of items at the time of procurement;
- Geographical location of the municipality in comparison to proposed material sources.

# iii) Comparison of unit cost per square meter of works

A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of infrastructure for all SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest unit cost per square metre was identified. A comparison of Gulu project unit cost per square meter was made against the lowest unit cost per square metre among the Municipalities. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

**3.7.4 Assessment of Economy**

# The score on economy was 22.74 out of 30 as detailed below; (a) Assessment of the price difference between similar quality and quantity of works

### i) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Engineer’s estimates

A review was made of the engineer’s estimates for all the SFG (and where applicable DDEG) projects in all the municipalities and the lowest engineer’s rates for the 5 selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu’s engineer’s rates was made against the lowest engineer’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.7-2: Comparison of Engineers Estimates across Municipalities

| **Bill Item** | **Unit** | **Eng. Est. Rate (F) UGX** | **Lowest rate among** **municipalities (F** m** **) UGX** | **Score** **(1\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Percentage of Engineer’s Rate to the Lowest** **(1+(F-**  **F** m** **)/F** m** **)%** |

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **3.05** | **Average = 198%** |  


The Municipality scored 3.05 out of 5. The engineer’s estimates were on average 98% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the local conditions and pricing of items at the time of estimation.

# ii) Comparison of unit project item costs as per Works contracts

A review was made of contractors’ rates for all the SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest contractor’s rates for the selected items were identified. A comparison of Gulu contractor’s rates was made against the lowest contractor’s rates among the municipalities for the same selected items. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

### Table 3.7-3: Comparison of Contractor’s Rates across Municipalities

| **Total Score** |<|<|<| **6.61** | **Average = 172%** |  


The Municipality scored 6.61 out of 10. Generally, the contractor’s rates were on average 72% higher than the lowest rates for the 5 items assessed across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the following;

- Contractor’s pricing strategy;
- Prevailing market prices of items at the time of procurement;
- Geographical location of the municipality in comparison to proposed material sources.

# iii)

# Comparison of unit cost per square meter of works

A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of infrastructure for all SFG (and DDEG where applicable) projects in all the Municipalities and the lowest unit cost per square metre was identified. A comparison of Gulu project unit cost per square meter was made against the lowest unit cost per square metre among the Municipalities. The results of the assessment are presented in the table below;

# Table 3.7-4: Comparison of Project Unit Costs

| **Cost per Square Meter of Building Works (F) (UGX)** | **Lowest Cost per Square Meter of Building Works Among Municipalities (F m** **) (UGX)** | **Score** **(15\*F** **m** **/F)** | **Proportion of the Project Unit Cost to the Lowest** **(1+(F-F** m** **)/F m** **)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 673,285 | 586,886 | **13.08** | **1.15** |  


The Municipality scored 13.08 out of 15. The project’s unit cost per square meter is 1.15 times that of the Municipality with the lowest unit cost per square meter of building works of similar scope across all the municipalities. This could be attributed to the quoted prices provided by the contractor.

**3.7.5 Assessment of Efficiency**

# The score on efficiency was 24 out of 35 as detailed below;

| **Finding** | **Cause** | **Implication** | **Recommendation** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| **(a)** Assessment of progress of works against time** **i) Assessment of physical progress lag basing on** **initial work programme**  According to the signed contract, works were to commence on 11 th February 2018 and were initially expected to achieve 100% completion by end of June, 2018. The commencement date indicated on IPC No.1 was 6 th February 2018, the day of contract signing. No formal project completion records were found on file, however the final payment was certified on 16 th April 2018. Therefore, the project was completed with in the contractual timelines, hence no physical progress lag. **ii) Assessment of physical progress lag basing on** **revised work programme**  As elaborated in (i) above, works were completed within the contract duration. Therefore, no revised programme was required. | Ok N/A | Ok Ok | Ok Ok |  
| **(b) Assessment of the existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works** **(i)**  **Presence of detailed measurement sheets**  Clause 17(4) of the PPDA (contracts) regulations 2014 requires that the actual work done is measured during the performance of a contract and is finally reconciled upon completion of the contract. The same is required under an admeasure contract adopted for this project. Measurement sheets corresponding to the payment certificates were neither attached to the certificates nor availed to the auditors for verification. In the absence of these, the audit team could not ascertain whether the Municipality undertook measurement of works during the process of certification. Non-measurement of works can lead to the risk of overpayments. || Non-measurement  of works exposes the Municipality to the risk of loss of funds  through overpayments to the contractor.. | The Accounting officer should ensure that the project manager takes measurements for works during execution.  These should be signed by the project manager and  contractor’s representative, kept on file and attached to the payment certificates  when prepared. |

The results are presented in the table below. From the table, some items checked did not conform to the drawings and specifications. | Quality control procedures could have been ignored. Being a small project, there is a possibility that implementation of site works as per design drawings was overlooked. As well as project managed and quality control. | Non-testing of construction materials can result in the use of poor quality materials ultimately affecting the quality of the infrastructure. Difficulties in controlling quality of works as well as avoiding poor workmanship and unnecessary variations. |  The Accounting officer should ensure that materials used for the works are tested to ensure conformance to quality requirements. The Municipality should ensure issuing of the contractor with drawings so as to implement proper designs; and copies of these should be put on the contract management file. |
