0,"(4) A single contract amendment shall not increase the total contract price by more than fifteen percent of the original contract price. (5) Where a contract is amended more than once, the cumulative value of all contract amendments shall not increase the total contract price by more than 25% of the original contract price. Consequently, the Economy Assessment Option adopted follows the criteria below: (i) Any Municipality with an Absolute % Difference less than or equal to 15.0% gets the maximum score of 5 for that unit cost difference; (ii) Otherwise the scores for the unit costs are computed using the Formula in Table 2.4-3", , 
1,3,Comparison of the % difference between the Contracted unit cost and the Final Implemented unit cost {15 marks},"Basis: PPDA Law on Contract Amendment as contained in the Contracts Regulations 2014; as follows: 55.

(2) The price to be charged by a provider for any related services that might be needed but which were not included in the contract shall be agreed upon in advance by the parties and shall not exceed the prevailing rates charged to other parties by the provider for similar services. (3) Notwithstanding sub regulation (2) a contract amendment for additional quantities of the same items shall use the same or lower unit prices as the original contract. (4) A single contract amendment shall not increase the total contract price by more than fifteen percent of the original contract price. (5) Where a contract is amended more than once, the cumulative value of all contract amendments shall not increase the total contract price by more than 25% of the original contract price. In assessing the parameter for % difference between Unit Costs in the Contract and the Final Implementation, an understanding of the above-cited PPDA Law on contract amendment in the Contracts Regulations 2014 has been considered. In application of the above law for scoring the parameter, it is taken that Clause 55 of the PPDA Works Contracts Regulations of 2014 allows a Contract Price to be varied in increments of not more than 0.1% up to a maximum cumulative increment of 1% of the Original Contract Price without need for amending the Contract. The Clause further allows amendment of the Contract in increments of not more than 15% up to a maximum cumulative amount of 25% of the"
