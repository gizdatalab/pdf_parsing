0,"Badrudin road and 1,077.8% on Gulu – Gulu Road;  Concrete Kerbing, Concrete channelling, Open concrete chutes and concrete linings for open drains: Items provided in this section of the BoQ are not applicable on the project, therefore the quantities provided in the contract under items 23.03(a), 23.07(a), 23.08(a)(i), 23.08(a)(ii)23.18(a), 23.18(c) are all ghost quantities;  Item 25.01(b): Stone pitching: It was not established how the engineer derived the quantities, but the auditor used the entire length the average dimensions of the already executed works on Gulu-Gulu Rd to calculate the final quantities; overall, the quantity was underestimated by 83.3% on Badrudin road and 50.2% on Gulu – Gulu Road;  Item 36.03(b): Roadbed preparation and compaction: While deriving the quantity, the engineer exaggerated the thickness of the roadbed to 0.65m instead of 0.15m provided in the specifications. This notwithstanding, it is also impractical to scarify and compact a roadbed layer of 650mm! Overall, the quantity was exaggerated by 370.8% on Badrudin road and 274.4% on Gulu – Gulu Road;  Item 39.01(a): Road Base: While deriving the quantity, the engineer exaggerated the thickness of the base layer to 0.65m instead of say 0.2m; no designs were available. Overall, the quantity was exaggerated by 435.0% on Badrudin road and 279.5% on Gulu – Gulu Road;  Prime Coat and Surface Dressing: While deriving the quantities for items under this section of the BoQ, the engineer used a width of 9.0m; no designs were available but physical measurements revealed that the DBST width on Badrudin Road is 8.5m average and 8.0m average on Gulu-Gulu Road. Overall, the quantities of items under this section of the BoQ were exaggerated as follows: - Item 41.01(a) Prime Coat: by 19.1% on Badrudin road and - 13.8% (underestimation) on Gulu – Gulu Road;", , ,"279,370,392."
