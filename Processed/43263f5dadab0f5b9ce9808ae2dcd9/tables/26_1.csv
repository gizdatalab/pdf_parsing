0,1.0,% difference between the quantities in the engineer’s estimates and those finally implemented. (10 Marks),Item 1,"5 items that are common to all USMID & Non USMID Municipal works contracts will be selected and the quantities of these in the engineers’ estimates and those finally implemented shall be compared to determine the absolute % difference between the two. For any of the items, the maximum allowable percentage difference will be taken as 25% and any % differences less or equal to this 25% will be given the maximum score of 2. Otherwise, the score (S) for any item will be computed using the formula; S=2×Fm/F, in which Fm is 25% and F is the absolute % difference of a particular item for the Municipality under consideration. Each of the items selected will be assessed separately across the Municipalities. The total score for this parameter for the municipality is the sum of the scores obtained for all the 5 items selected. In municipalities where detailed engineer’s estimates for some items were not applicable, a conversion factor shall be applied in the respective cases. While municipalities where the detailed engineer’s estimates were applicable but they did not provide them, they shall be scored zero for this parameter."

5,2.0,% difference between the Engineer’s unit cost and the contracted unit cost (5 Marks),Physical cost,"The engineer’s and contracted unit cost shall be obtained by respectively dividing the physical cost as per the engineer’s estimates and contracted cost by the respective areas of the works. The engineer’s unit cost and the contracted unit cost shall then be compared to determine the absolute % difference. The maximum allowable percentage difference in unit cost per square meter will be taken as 15.0% and any % differences less or equal to 15.0% will be given the maximum score of 5. Otherwise, the score (S) for the given unit cost difference shall be computed using the formula; 𝐒 = 𝟓 𝐱 𝐅𝐦/𝐅, in which Fm is 15.0% and F is the absolute % difference in unit cost per square meter of the project under consideration."

8,3.0,% difference between the contracted unit cost and the final unit cost (15 Marks),Physical cost,"The contracted and final unit cost shall be obtained by respectively dividing the physical cost as per the contracted and final cost by the respective areas of the works. The contracted unit cost and the final unit cost shall then be compared to determine the % difference. The maximum allowable % difference in unit cost per square meter will be taken as 15.0% and any % differences less or equal to 15 % will be given the maximum score of 15. Otherwise, the scores (S) for the given unit cost difference shall be computed using the formula; 𝐒 = 𝟏𝟓 𝐱 𝐅𝐦/𝐅, in which Fm is 15.0% and F is the absolute % difference in unit cost per square meter of the project under consideration."
