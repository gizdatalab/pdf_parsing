The Auditor observed that measurement sheets for the value of works executed were not on the management file.,Poor project management.,Failure to know the actual quantity of work done upon which payment should have been effected.,The Accounting Officer should ensure that detailed measurement sheets are prepared and attached to the payment certificates.
2,"Management Response It is true that at the time of preparation of the certificates of payments, the Engineer relied on the quantities in the Bill of Quantities to prepare the certificates of payment. This came about because of the capacity gaps in the Engineering department. Management is working hard to breach these capacity gaps by recruiting more staff in the Engineering department and planned to support refresher courses for staff in the Engineering department to boost their performance in the subsequent contracts. Attached is the submission letter to District Service Commission of Gulu for recruitment of the principal Engineer.", , ,
