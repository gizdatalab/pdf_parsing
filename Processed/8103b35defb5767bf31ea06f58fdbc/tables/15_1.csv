No subsequent inspections of pack houses were undertaken by management to establish pest free areas contrary the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 1995. I also noted that all other subsequent inspections are undertaken solely on the produce for export, a practice which does not meet international phytosanitary requirements.

The practice is susceptible to manipulation and falsification of details This may also lead to certification of products and produce that do not meet the Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, hence rejection at international markets due to questionable integrity.", The Ministry is transiting from issuing manual certificates to electronic ones which will eliminate the risk of issuing blank certificate.,
