," Thirty-five (35) output with a total of fifty-eight (58) activities and expenditure worth UGX 238.641Bn were not quantified at all. That is none of the fifty-eight (58) activities within these outputs was quantified at all. in Appendix II.

Some of the activities that were not sufficiently quantified were; 1. Renovation and construction of secondary school infrastructure, including 2. Replacement of asbestos. 3. Procurement of uniforms and protective gear for staff. 4. Servicing of KCCA land lease premiums and property rates. 5. Capacity Development of Project Managers and Project Teams 6. Purchase of equipment. 7. School inspection and monitoring Quarterly activities undertaken. 8. Payment of secondary School teachers’ salaries. Failure to plan and report on the quality/quantity of activities implemented renders it difficult to establish the reasonableness of individual activity costs for each planned output which curtails effective accountability when funds are subsequently spent. without clearly and fully quantified outputs, I could not ascertain the level of achievement of these outputs and whether funds appropriated by parliament and released were spent and the intended objectives achieved. Accounting Officer explained that management was in the process of streamlining the Directorate work plans and further realigning its planned interventions along the NDP III PIAPS to ensure that all activities and outputs are fully quantified.
