3,"(d) Review of Contract Supervision and Monitoring Arrangements during project closure (i) Presence of detailed certificate of completion. From the audit review of the contract management files, it was discovered that no detailed completion certificate had been issued.",Poor project management.,Rectification of snags may not be done effectively.,The municipality should inspect works after completion to identify any defects and then issue a detailed completion certificate accompanied with a snag list.
4,Manage Response The detailed certificate of completion was not prepared by the engineering department due to capacity gaps and the management is working to build the capacity of the staff in the department through recruitment and refresher trainings. Auditor’s Remarks To be followed up., , , 
5,(ii) Presence of As-built drawings and Maintenance Manuals The as-built drawings were not prepared and were not available on the project management file. Clause GCC 58.1 of special conditions of contract requires the issuance of As-built drawings on practical completion date which was not even adhered to. The contract however did not specify who was to prepare the as built drawings.,Poor contract formulation.,Lack of as-built drawings may hinder economic and effective future maintenance interventions.,The Special Conditions of Contract need to clearly indicate the need for as-built drawings and specify the person in charge of their production.
