Due to heavy rains received in the area, the time for completion was revised to 24 th October 2019. The progress report dated 23 rd June 2019 indicated that by end of June 2019, the physical progress achieved was 85.5%. No further reports exist on the project management file.

In accordance with the above reported physical progress, the physical progress lag was 14.5%.",Poor contract management.,Delayed completion of works denies beneficiaries timely use of the infrastructure.,"The Accounting Officer should put in place measures to ensure that works are always executed and completed as per the planned timeline.
