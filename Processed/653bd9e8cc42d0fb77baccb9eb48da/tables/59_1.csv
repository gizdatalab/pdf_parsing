0,"- Items 42.01(a) and (b) First Seal and Second Seal: by 42.9% on Badrudin Road and by 3.4% on Gulu-Gulu Road;  Item 55.03(b)(i) Yellow Lines: While deriving the quantity, the engineer exaggerated the length by 3 times; maximum should be same as length of the road since yellow line will be marked at centre only. Overall, the quantity was exaggerated by 228.9% on Badrudin road and 121.7% on Gulu – Gulu Road; As can be seen from the assessment tables below, the exaggerated quantities in the engineer’s estimate, which were carried into the procured contract, led to an exaggerated Contract Sum of UGX 1,094,579,093 VAT Inclusive (or UGX 927,609,590 VAT Exclusive) for double surface dressing of an ordinary single carriageway road of 8 to 8.5m width and 0.63Km, which translates to UGX 1.737Bn per Km. By correcting the quantities and applying the approved contract rates, the Expected Contract Amount becomes UGX 624,620,433 VAT Inclusive (or UGX 529,339,350 VAT Exclusive) as shown in the table immediately below. This means that, if the Municipality Continues to certify payments without properly conducting detailed measurement of actual works executed, it will cause a financial loss to Government of UGX 354,098,355 VAT Exclusive. The amount already certified by the Municipality inclusive of certified works and unrecovered advance portion is UGX 867,625,561 VAT Exclusive, which is higher than the expected final contract sum of UGX 529,339,350 by UGX 338,286,211.", , ,
