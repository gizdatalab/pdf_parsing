0,(a) Assessment of the quality of works under implementation (i) Material test results on file Review of the contract management file showed that there were no material test results and approved quality control and Quality Assurance document on file. Poor project management It poses a risk of use of materials that do not conform to the specifications. The Municipality should ensure that materials to be used in the permanent works are tested to avoid using materials that do not meet specification., , , , , , ,
