## REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF

**UGANDA NATIONAL AIRLINES COMPANY LIMITED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH**

## JUNE 2019

## THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

## Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited which comprise the statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2019, and the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited as at 30 th June 2019 and its financial performance and cash flows for the period then ended, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2012 of Uganda.

## Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of Uganda National Airlines Company Limited in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, are of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. I have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in my report.

## Other Information

The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Chief Executive Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that

---

there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

## Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards on Accrual basis of Accounting and for such internal controls as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  
The Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

## Auditor General’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:-

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

---

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Directors with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Other Reporting Responsibilities

As required by the Companies Act, I report to you, based on my audit, that:

- I have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of my audit;
- In my opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the Company, so far as appears from my examination of those books; and
- The Company's statement of financial position and statement of financial performance are in agreement with the books of account.
