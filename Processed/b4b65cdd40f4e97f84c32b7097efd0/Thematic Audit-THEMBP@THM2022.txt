EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Every year Parliament approves the annual budget which contains Government’s projections of revenue and expenditure for the year. The approved budget for 2021/2022 was UGX.44.8

Tn, which was revised through supplementary expenditure to UGX.51.56Tn. The theme for the annual budget for financial year 2021/2022 was “Industrialization for inclusive growth,

employment and wealth creation”. I under took a review of the implementation of the

budget in MDAs and LGs and below is a summary of my findings, details of which have been included in the individual reports that have been separately issued.

i. The 2020/2021 budget was rated 63.4% (moderately satisfactory) compliant to the NDP III. This performance was 6.6 percentage points below the benchmark rating of 70%. However, this was an improvement in comparison to the score of 60% that

was attained in the previous year.

ii. Government planned to collect revenue of UGX.47.18Tn by the end of the financial year 2021/2022, UGX.44.43Tn was realized, representing 94% performance.

iii. Government planned to spend UGX.51.56Tn, however only UGX.48.85tn was warranted, leaving a balance of UGX.2.7Tn translating to 95% of the revised budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.48.85Tn only UGX.44.421Tn was absorbed

representing 91% absorption.

iv. Whereas the initial budget appropriated by Parliament was balanced (i.e. Revenue

estimates equaled expenditure estimates), the revised budget as a result of

supplementaries, had revenue estimates of UGX.47.17Tn as compared to expenditure estimates of UGX.51.56Tn, creating a budget deficit of UGX.4.39Tn. This

was due to continued approval of supplementaries without corresponding increase in revenue.

v. Out of a total of 1,325 outputs worth UGX.10.729Tn analyzed, 458 outputs (34.6%) worth UGX.2.995Tn were fully implemented, 758 outputs (57.2%) worth UGX.7.38Tn

were partially Implemented while 109 out puts (8.2%) worth UGX.0.354Tn were not implemented at all.

vi. MDAs faced challenges in regard to the effectiveness of service delivery to the

citizens. I analyzed 134 activities worth UGX.786.9Bn and noted that 81 activities worth UGX 363.3Bn had delayed, 21 activities worth UGX.208.4Bn were not of satisfactory quality, 2 activities worth 40.78Bn were implemented at a higher cost than should have been incurred and 23 activities worth UGX.83.3Bn had quantities delivered that were less than what was planned.











ix. Nineteen (19) LGs had not utilised wage funds in excess of UGX.2Bn which were provided as supplementary funds in the month of June 2022. The DLGs explained

that wage funds were sent in excess of their respective wage requirements.

x.

MoLG made frequent transfers of Accounting Officers/CAOs from one LG to another,

which disrupted implementation of activities and affected service delivery. Some of affected CAOs were of Bulisa DLG, Hoima DLG and Fort Portal City, Amuria DLG, Mityana DLG, Butebo DLG, Kabarole DLG and Kitagwenda DLG where two to four Accounting Officers were posted to the respective LGs within the same financial year.

xi.

Twenty-three (23) LGs transferred UGX.6.4Bn to LLGs towards the end of the

financial year to avoid funds remaining unutilized. This may result into

misappropriation of public funds.

xii. I noted that funds amounting to UGX.5.46Bn relating to pension, pension arrears and gratuity were mis-classified. Similarly, funds amounting to UGX.34.06Bn were charged on wrong account codes by the Accounting Officers.

xiii.

I reviewed a sample of seven (7) programmes implemented in the LGs and noted

that they faced challenges which affected effectiveness in delivery of services. These challenges included; low absorption of funds, inadequate programme designs, delayed procurements, weaknesses in monitoring and supervision of implementation among others.

Key Recommendations

i. Government should fast-track implementation of all core projects as listed in the NDP

III in order to improve the level of compliance of subsequent budgets to the NDP III framework and align allocation of resources to programmes and activities to what is listed in the NDP.

ii. I advised the PS/ST to explore more avenues of ensuring that all budgeted revenue is

always realised to fund the budget as approved.

iii.

I advised the Accounting Officers to always liaise with MoFPED during implementation

to ensure that GoU funds are released as planned. In addition, the Accounting Officers

should ensure that the affected activities are implemented in the subsequent periods. Government should also ensure that issuing warrants is based on more realistic revenue projections.











vi.

I advised NPA to expedite the issuance of NDP III of approvals for strategic plans and build capacity of planners in the government entities to minimize delays in the preparation and approval of strategic plans.

vii. I advised Government to ensure that all funds are included in the PBS and appropriated by Parliament, and expenditure of such funds follows the government

financial system. In addition, all funds received outside the approved budget during

the year should be disclosed to the PS/ST for supplementary appropriation.

viii.

I advised the PS/ST to ensure that funds are released in accordance with the approved

budgets to avoid release of funds that cannot be absorbed.

ix. I advised MoPS to ensure that pension, gratuity and pension arrears are disaggregated and sent on the right budget codes. I advised PS/ST to ensure that Accounting Officers appropriate allocated funds to the right codes during budgeting.

x. I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure funds are absorbed once availed, review

the programme designs with the aim of addressing some of the design challenges and enhance supervision and monitoring of the implementation of these projects.

Overall Conclusion

Government performed well in areas such as; performance and absorption of warrants

which performed at 95% and 91% respectively. However, I noted shortcomings such as;

unsatisfactory alignment of the budget to the NDP-III, approval of supplementaries without

matching revenue, failure to implement planned activities, only 47% of LGs had their plans certified by NPA, off-budget financing in LGs, and challenges in service delivery among

others. However, government can perform better and improve budget credibility if the proposed recommendations are adopted.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background

Parliament approved the annual budget for financial year 2021/2022, which specified the resource allocated to each vote for implementation of outputs and delivery of services to

the citizens. This was in line with section 13(3) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015 which requires the Minister in charge of Finance on behalf of the President to present the proposed annual budget for the Financial Year to Parliament to be approved by 1 st April of the preceding year. The approved budget for 2021/2022 was UGX.44.8 Tn, which was revised through supplementary expenditure to UGX51.51Tn. The theme

for the annual budget for financial year 2021/2022 was “Industrialization for inclusive

growth, employment and wealth creation”. The sector allocations of the 2021/2022

budget are shown below.

This office has over the years undertaken assessments of the implementation of the











budgets by the various MDAs and LGs. It is against this background that budget

performance was considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning.

1.2

Justification for the review of the performance of the budget

The Government annual budget provides a roadmap through which government

allocates resources for the realization of service delivery priorities. The budget therefore

reflects a set of promises Government makes to the citizens in terms of how resources

will be utilized during the year. It is therefore important to assess the extent to which

these promises have been kept by Government and if the government budget was

credible.

Previous audits on the performance of the annual budgets have also revealed a number

of challenges and shortcomings within the planning, budgeting, implementation and

performance systems within Government. Some of the shortcomings repeatedly

observed include; inaccurate revenue forecasts, under-performance of revenue, under absorption of funds, failure to implement planned activities, work plans without appropriate performance indicators, partial and non-implementation of out-puts, inaccurate reporting among others.

Performance of the budget has a direct correlation with service delivery and accountability for resources entrusted with Accounting Officers. It helps to assess if

Accounting officers have used the resources entrusted to them well and for the right purpose. It is against this background that budget performance was again selected as a

thematic area for audit for the financial year 2021/2022.

1.3

Objectives of the Audit

The main objective of the review was to assess if the 2021/2022 budget was implemented in accordance with the Appropriation Act, budget execution circulars issued by PS/ST and if the implementation resulted in delivery of anticipated services to the

citizens. The specific objectives were as follows.

At National Level

i. To establish the level of consistency of the annual approved budget to the National

Development Plans.

ii. To assess the revenue performance for the year. iii. To assess the warrants performance for the year. iv. To assess the level of absorption of warranted funds.











b) Local Governments-LGs

i.

To assess if budgets of LGs were supported by strategic plans that are aligned to NDP-

III ii. To assess the performance of revenue against the budget. iii.

To establish if LGs received off-budget financing

iv. To confirm if the anticipated services were delivered to the achieved by citizens from a

sample of programmes implemented in the LGs

v. To establish if LGs have adequate risk management system for the implementation of

the budget.

1.4

Scope of the Audit

The budget performance assessment was undertaken in all the MDAs, Projects and LGs

audited during the year and the specific entity findings have been included in the entity specific reports.

For the purpose of consolidating my findings into this theme report, I analysed the results of 102 MDAs and 169 Local Governments.

1.5 Data Collection Methods

Data was collected using the following methods;

Interviews

Interviews were conducted with technical officers and stakeholders, including Accounting Officers, Planners, Heads of Departments, Budget Officers, NPA, among others.

Review of documents

Documents such as; Vision 2040, NDP III, approved budgets, financial statements, Ministerial Policy Statements and Work Plans, quarterly and annual performance reports,

among others, were reviewed.

The Ministry of Finance issues the first Budget Call Circular (BCC) by 15th September to

enable entities to prepare and submit Budget Framework Papers (BFPs) by 15th November of the preceding year.

Once the entities submit the Budget Framework Papers, they are consolidated into the National Budget Framework Paper by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to cabinet for review/clearance before submission to Parliament. The submission of the National Budget Framework Paper to Parliament should be done by 31st December of the

preceding year. The resolutions of both Cabinet and Parliament on the Budget

Framework Paper inform adjustments to the budget proposals prepared initially by MoFPED.

After this, the Ministry of Finance issues the second Budget Call Circular with revised resources estimates by 15th February of the preceding financial year for entities to prepare estimates in line with budget ceilings provided by MoFPED. The entities then

prepare and submit budget estimates, Ministerial policy statements, and work plans to Parliament for review and approval by 1st April of the preceding year.

2.2.2 Budget Approval

Once the budget estimates, Ministerial Policy Statements, and Work Plans are submitted to Parliament, they are reviewed, adjusted (where need be) and approved. This

approval is supported by an Appropriations Bill, which should be presented by 31st May. Once this is completed, the Minister responsible for Finance prepares the budget speech,

which must be read by 15th June.

The signing of the Appropriations Bill by His Excellency the President completes approval of the budget and gives clearance for the execution of the budget effective 1 st July.

2.2.3 Approval of Supplementary Appropriations

Section 25(1) of the PFMA 2015 provides that, where in respect of any financial year, it

is found that the amount appropriated by an Appropriation Act is insufficient or that a

need has arisen for expenditure for a purpose for which no amount has been

appropriated by the Appropriation Act, a supplementary estimate, showing the amount

required, shall be laid before Parliament, by the Minister through a Supplementary Appropriation Bill.

An Accounting Officer who requires supplementary funding shall, in writing, request the Minister of Finance for approval of up to 3% of the total approved budget for the financial year. The supplementary estimate shall be laid before Parliament for approval, and in the case of excess expenditure, within four months after the money is spent. The supplementary expenditure should be an expenditure that cannot be funded through virements, cannot be postponed to the next financial year, or was unforeseeable.











2.2.4 Budget Execution

Once Parliament approves the budget estimates, the secretary to the Treasury prepares

and issues the Budget Execution Circular by 30th June the preceding year to guide the budget execution for the financial year, which commences on 1 st July.

The Ministry of Finance is also responsible for mobilizing resources for the entities to implement the planned activities. The main sources of funds are tax revenues collected

by URA, Non-Tax revenues, external financing and debt. These resources are disbursed /released to the entities every quarter through the issue of cash limits/warrants in accordance with the Government Cash Flow Plan.

On the other hand, the entities are expected to use the resources allocated and disbursed to them to implement activities as detailed in the approved Ministerial Policy

Statements and approved Work Plans.

2.2.5 Budget Monitoring and Reporting

The Ministry of Finance mainly does budget monitoring through the Budget Monitoring

and Accountability Unit (BMAU), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and the Accounting Officers of the respective MALGs. The Budget Monitoring Unit and OPM review how

appropriated funds have been used to implement activities in the approved work plans.

The Accounting officers using the internal systems such as the internal audit function

monitor and ensure that budgets are implemented as approved.

Entities are required to submit quarterly performance reports to the Ministry of Finance through the PBS system detailing performance against the approved work plans by the 30 th day of the first month following the end of a particular quarter. These quarterly

reports are consolidated into semi-annual and annual budget performance reports.

The results of these monitoring processes are used to prepare the Government Annual Performance Report (GAPR) and the Annual Budget Report by the Ministry of Finance. Cabinet and Parliament discuss these reports with the intention of taking action on the

recommendations so as to improve the budget process.

3.0

FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Below are the key findings, conclusions and recommendations from my review, details of which were included in the individual MDA/Project and LG reports.

3.1

Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations at Treasury Level

3.1.1 Areas of commendable performance

Progress towards full implementation of the programme development approach.

The Programme Approach to planning was adopted by Government two years ago to reduce the silo approach to planning and budgeting. Progress has been made towards full transition for instance; Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) are

currently providing the basis for planning and budgeting, and the budgeting systems have been adjusted accordingly which has improved the link between the Development

Plan and the National Budget.

3.1.2 Areas of improvement a) Alignment of the budget to the National Development Plan

Section 13 (6) of the Public Finance Management Act states that the annual budget shall

be consistent with the National Development Plan, the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility and the Budget Framework Paper. The National Planning Authority (NPA) undertakes an

annual assessment of the level of compliance of the annual budget to the National

Development Plan as a way of ensuring that development planning and budgeting

frameworks are designed to achieve Vision 2040 through the National Development Plans.

I reviewed the Certificate of Compliance (CoC) prepared by the National Planning

Authority (NPA) and noted that the 2021/2022 approved budget was rated 63.4% which

was categorised as “Moderately satisfactory” level of consistency to the NDP-III. This

rating was 6.6 percentage points below the benchmark rating of 70%. However, this

was an improvement in the level of consistency in comparison to 2020/2021 where the

budget was rated at 60%. The performance assessed was explained by the following.

Table 2: Reasons for the noted level of consistency with NDP-III

No.	Details	Weighted % Score	Reasons for level of consistency with NDP-III	
1	Macroeconomic level	75	 This level of performance was as a result of prudent macro management that saw Government introduce a raft of measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic during the second lockdown.	
2	National/Strategic Level	68.4	 The annual budget was largely informed by the NDP III goals and programme targets, however with significant gaps in funding and implementing the core NDP III projects.	
3	Programme	59.9	 This performance was attributed to allocative inefficiencies within programmes and implementing	














	actors and weak coordination, planning, budgeting and implementation of programme activities.	
4	MDA Level	64.5	 This was attributed to weak planning and budgeting for results and implementation of projects.	
5	Local Government Level	60.5	 This performance was attributed to moderately satisfactory alignment of the annual work plans and budgets inadequate performance to Local Governments.and transfersprogrammes of GoUto

There is a risk that the continued inconsistencies of the approved budgets with the NDP III will curtail the attainment of the desired growth and targets as envisioned in the

National Development Plan.

Government was advised to:

 Ensure that implementation of all core projects listed in the NDP III is fast-tracked. In addition, Government should align the allocation of resources to programmes and activities to what is listed in the National Development Plan.

- Improve the coordination among programmes.

 Ensure that all funds for implementation of activities are appropriated by Parliament.

b ) Budgeting for Non-Tax Revenue

Section 6 of the Budget Execution Circular for the FY 2021/22 provides that all work

plans and Budgets for FY2021/22 are prepared and approved using the Program Budgeting System (PBS). All Budgets, irrespective of the source of financing (GoU,

NTR/AIA, Donor or LG Revenue), will be migrated and loaded into the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) to facilitate Budget Implementation and reporting.

According to the approved Budget estimates for the FY2021/22, it was projected that a total of UGX.1.588Tn would be collected as NTR. Review of Program Based Budgeting (PBB) tool used by the Government and IFMS records revealed that that NTR budgets for the respective MDAs were neither uploaded on PBS nor IFMS. The budgeting tool only had details regarding expenditure, and no revenue was included. I further noted

that several Accounting Officers disowned the figures incorporated in the NTR Estimates book, indicating that they had not been consulted in arriving at the estimates.

As a result, I was unable to compare respective entity budget figures with the URA NTR collections that totalled to UGX.1.230Tn. Absence of proper revenue estimates for each entity undermines transparency, affects motivation of staff, and hampers performance assessment.











c) Revenue Performance

Government planned to collect revenue of UGX.47.18Tn from both domestic and external sources during the year 2021/2022. By the end of the financial year however, UGX.44.43Tn had been collected implying that there was a shortfall of UGX.2.75Tn in

the revenue collections. This represents an overall revenue performance of 94%. Refer to table below for details.

The current year revenue performance of 94% does not significantly differ from the revenue performance of the prior year which was at 93%. The revenue sources with the

biggest under performance were loans under budget support with a variance of

UGX.1.06Tn. A detailed analysis of the entity revenue performance has been reported in

the individual entity reports.

The PS/ST explained that Performance of tax revenues were affected by poor economic

conditions in 2021/22, while the Non-Tax Revenue collections were affected by the

general slow economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19.

Shortfalls in revenue performance implies that Government could not fully finance its planned programmes, which in turn affected service delivery.

The failure to fully fund the budget affected the implementation of planned activities by entities thus affecting service delivery. Below are some of the cases where budget cuts

affected service delivery;

Development

A detailed analysis of the entity absorption performance has been reported in the

individual entity reports.

I observed that the failure to utilize the warrants was attributed to the following;

a) Some entities could not raise invoices to utilise all the warrants available to them, due to implementation challenges.











Failure to absorb funds negatively affects service delivery since some of the planned

projects and activities are not undertaken.

I advised the PS/ST to explore strategies aimed at addressing implementation challenges and also consider issuing warrants based on more realistic revenue projections.

f) Approval of supplementary funding without matching revenue

Section 15 (1) and (2) of the PFMA 2015, require that after approval of the annual

budget by Parliament, the Secretary to the Treasury shall issue the annual cash flow

plan of Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans, and recruitment

plans approved by Parliament. The annual cash flow plan shall form the basis for release of funds by the Accountant General to the Accounting Officers.

Section 25(1) of the Public Finance and Accountability Act (PFMA) stipulates that the

total supplementary expenditure that requires additional resources over and above what

is approved by Parliament shall not exceed 3% of the total approved budget for that

financial year, without the approval of Parliament.

Whereas the initial budget appropriated by Parliament was balanced (i.e. Revenue estimates equalled expenditure estimates), I noted that the revised budget as a result of supplementaries, had revenue estimates of UGX.47.17Tn as compared to expenditure

estimates of UGX.51.56Tn, creating a budget deficit of UGX.4.39Tn. Overall, since the

initial budget was UGX.44.8Tn and the actual expenditure only amounted to 44.4Tn, it

implies that there was no need for the supplementary budget given that the original resources envelope was not fully realised.

Continued approval of supplementary budgets without a corresponding increase in

revenue/financing could be attributed to fiscal indiscipline which leads to increased funding gap affecting the earlier budget objectives and plans.

The PS/ST stated that supplementary funding was issued against targeted borrowings and enhanced revenue mobilization measures that did not materialize. However, going

forward, supplementary funding will be issued against confirmed funding sources of inflows to avoid unfunded activities and over commitments.

I advised the PS/ST to ensure that all supplementary expenditure approvals are supported with supplementary sources of financing to ensure that the earlier appropriated activities are implemented as planned.











analysis. I further observed that most of the MDAs have had their 5-year Strategic plans

approved by the National Planning Authority.

3.2.2 Areas of improvement a) Implementation of outputs by MDAs and Projects

I reviewed the quarterly performance reports, and undertook physical inspections to

assess the extent to which planned activities had been implemented.

Based on the procedures undertaken, I noted that out of a total of 1,325 quantified outputs worth UGX.10.729Tn assessed, 458 (34.6%) outputs worth UGX.2.995Tn were fully implemented, 758 outputs (57.2%) worth UGX.7.38Tn were partially implemented, while 109 (8.2%) outputs worth UGX.0.354Tn were not implemented at all as shown in

the table below. Details in Appendix I.

b) Delivery of Services from implemented activities

I analyzed 134 activities worth UGX.786.9Bn in 54 entities to assess if there was

adequate service delivery to the citizens from the activities that were implemented by

the Accounting Officers during the year. I used five parameters namely; a) Timeliness

with which the activity was undertaken, b) costs involved in implementing the activity, c)

quantities delivered, d) quality of service/works delivered and e) functionality. Below is a

summary of my observations, details of which have been provided in the individual entity reports.

 Eighty-one (81) activities worth UGX.363.3Bn had delayed and were therefore behind schedule which resulted in delayed service delivery. Refer to Appendix II (a).  Twenty-one (21) activities worth UGX.91.3Bn were completed but were not functional due to various reasons which affected service delivery. Refer to Appendix II (b).  Seven (7) activities worth UGX.208.4Bn were not of satisfactory quality which affected the usability and fitness for purpose of the works/services delivered. Refer to

Appendix II (c).  Two (2) activities worth UGX.40.7Bn were implemented at a higher cost to Government

than what Government should have incurred which made the activities more costly.

Refer to Appendix II (d).  Twenty-three (23) activities worth UGX.83.3Bn had quantities delivered which were less

than what was planned in the approved work plans or expected as per contract agreements. Refer to Appendix II (e).

The above shortcomings were attributed to delayed commencement of procurements, weaknesses in contract supervision, staffing gaps within the MDAs, late release of funds,

inadequate capacity of contractors among others.

Failure to deliver expected services to beneficiaries negates the purpose of allocation of resources and diminishes confidence in Government processes through which services

should reach the citizens.

I advised the Accounting Officers to undertake procurements in a timely manner, strengthen contract supervision and plan appropriately on how to manage the negative effects of delayed release of funds.

3.3

Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations for Local Governments

In regard to Local Governments specifically, I undertook procedures to confirm; if Local Governments had prepared strategic Plans that were aligned to NDP III, had received











By the end of the FY2021/22, only 80 (47%) out of 169 LGs had their strategic plans certified by NPA. By the time of writing this report, NPA had not yet certified strategic

plans for 89 (53%) LGs that had submitted, as shown below;

Status of Approval of Strategic Plans By NPA

Approved

Not

47%

approved 53%

I noted that Parliament approved budgets for 169 LGs in the FY 2020/21 and 89 LGs in

the FY 2021/22 without the corresponding certification of strategic plans by NPA. Details

are in Appendix III.

As a result, some of the Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AW&Bs) and therefore the activities implemented in the FY 2021/22 may not be consistent with the NDP III, which

may hinder the attainment of the development goals, objectives and targets set by the country.

The Accounting Officers attributed the above to delays by NPA to review and give

feedback on the strategic plans, compounded by lack of training and technical support

from NPA and MoFPED during the development of the strategic plans.

My interaction with the PS/ST, revealed that the change from sector to programmatic approach led to delayed issuance of the NDP III implementation plan by NPA to LGs

thus affecting the preparation and approval of the strategic plans.

I advised NPA to expedite the issuance of NDP III implementation plan and to build

capacity of planners in the government entities to minimize delays in the preparation and approval of strategic plans.

b) Off Budget Financing/Receipts











This therefore implies that the total budgets of these entities were understated, thus distorting planning and, may result in duplication of activities. Details are shown in the

table below.

No.	Vote Code	Entity Name	Amount (UGX)	
1	523	Kayunga District	773,412,069	
2	544	Nakasongola District	400,000,000	
3	586	Otuke District	342,888,374	
4	602	Rubirizi District	350,890,654	
5	556	Yumbe District	1,803,548,082	
	Total		3,670,739,179	




The Accounting Officers attributed this to limitations of the PBS system which has no

provision for inputting such off budget receipts and also receipt of funds not expected at the time of planning.

During my interaction with PS/ST indicated that MoFPED created a window to allow off budget financing to be recognised in PBS. In addition, MoFPED is continuously engaging development partners to fund LGs through the government funding system.

I advised Government to ensure that all funds are included in the PBS and appropriated

by Parliament, and expenditure of such funds follows the government financial system. In addition, Accounting Officers should ensure that all funds received outside the

approved budget during the year should be disclosed to the PS/ST for supplementary

appropriation.

c) Excess release of wage funds to LGs

During the year under review, I observed that 101 LGs did not utilise all warranted wage

funds. I sampled 19 LGs that had not utilised wage funds in excess of UGX.2,000,000,000 and observed that all these entities received supplementary wage

funding towards the end of the financial year. These entities did not utilize a total of

UGX.54,585,930,745 during the year. Details are in the table below and in Appendix

IV.

These unutilized funds were in many instances in excess of the annual wage

requirement of the respective LGs. The Accounting Officers of Kiryandongo DLG, Kisoro DLG, Kole DLG and Nakasongola DLG explained that they received wage funds

amounting to UGX.3,862,110,354 in excess of what was requested. Details are in the

No.	Entity	Amount released in excess of the requirement (UGX)	
1.	Kiryandongo DLG	2,578,969,118	
2.	Kisoro DLG	753,706,312	
3.	Kole DLG	414,577,139	
4.	Nakasongola DLG	114,857,785	
	TOTAL	3,862,110,354	














I also observed that whereas the cities had not operationalized the city staff structures,

funds for recruitment were released and therefore remained unutilized at the end of the financial year.

This limits the availability of funds to cater for priority areas and creates an avenue for

misappropriation of funds. The Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to

disburse funds lies with MoFPED.

I advised the PS/ST to ensure that funds are released in accordance with the approved

budgets.

d) Transfer of funds to LLGs by LGs to avoid sweep backs

Section 17(1) of the PFMA 2015 provides that every appropriation by Parliament shall

expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made.

Sub Section (2) provides that a vote that does not expend money that was appropriated

to the vote for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year, repay the money

to the Consolidated Fund.

During my audit of the FY 2021/22, I observed that 23 LGs transferred UGX.6,493,901,877 to LLGs towards the end of the financial year to avoid funds remaining unutilized. This action contradicts Section 17(1) and (2) of the PFMA 2015 and may result into misappropriation of public funds. Details are in Appendix V.

The Accounting Officers explained that the transfer was based on the advice from the P/S MoH to transfer the construction funds to the Health Centres. The Accounting Officers further explained that the funds for other construction projects were meant for

committed contracts that were still ongoing and that the process of re-voting the funds swept back always delays or may not be successful.

During my interaction with MoFPED, PS/ST acknowledged the observation and promised

to take corrective action.

I await the outcome of the corrective action.

e) Misclassification of expenditure

Instruction 7.10.3 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 stipulates that the chart of accounts











 In some LGs, UGX.34,062,500,859 was charged on wrong account item codes contrary to those in which they were budgeted for as shown in the table below and in Appendix

VI.

Program	Number of HLGs	Amount (UGX)	
Pension and gratuity	43	5,461,616,914	
Microscale Irrigation	39	20,478,337,116	
Ex-gratia	11	525,038,679	
Other expenditure lines	43	13,059,125,064	
Total		39,524,117,773	




The Accounting Officers explained that:

 All payments of pension, gratuity and pension arrears are aggregated to one code in the

interface file.

 Different program activities were budgeted for under one account code which led to expenditure being charged wrongly contrary to where they were budgeted for. This is a matter that can only be addressed by PS/ST.

I explained to the Accounting Officers that the LGs are likely to deviate from the planned activities without early detection by management.

During my interaction with MoFPED it was explained that the PS/ST will engage MoPS on

the aggregation of pension and gratuity matters while for the misclassifications arising from budgeting on wrong codes, the Accounting Officers will be reminded to appropriately budget for expenditure on the correct codes.

I advised MoPS to ensure that pension, gratuity and pension arrears are disaggregated and sent on the right budget codes. I further advised PS/ST to ensure that Accounting Officers appropriate allocated funds to the right codes during budgeting.

f) Service delivery from implemented projects

I assessed the extent to which a sample of seven (7) programmes worth UGX.551.3Bn implemented by Government had resulted into service delivery to the communities.

The programmes that were sampled were; a) Micro Scale Irrigation Programme, b) Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Programmme & Additional Funding (USMID-AF) in Refugee Hosting Districts, c) The Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development in Cities and Municipal Councils, d) Uganda Inter-

governmental Fiscal Transfers, e) Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project, f) Support to organised groups for improvement of people’s livelihood and g)

No.	Details	Amount Audited (UGX) Bn	Summary of Key Findings	
1	Micro Scale Irrigation Programme	49	The 40 LGs utilised UGX.20.7Bn (42%) leaving UGX.28.3Bn unspent.	
			10 LGs did not utilise funds warranted of UGX.9.6Bn meant for procurement of irrigation equipment.	
			23 LGs planned and sensitised 31,487 farmers on the benefits of irrigation and the importance of co-funding.	
			Out of the total of 31,487 farmers who were sensitised, only	














	8,781 expressed interest in the irrigation equipment.	
27 farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.680Mn without co-funding while some farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.329Mn with partial co-funding.	
2	Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program, Additional Funding (USMID-AF) in Refugee Hosting Districts	50.1	Out of the total receipts, only UGX.8.1Bn (16%) was spent, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.41.9Bn (84%).	
			I also noted that in the previous financial year, 8 LGs did not utilise UGX.63.9Bn received for USMID-AF activities.	
3	The Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development in Cities and Municipal Councils	156.3	Only UGX.124.8Bn (80%) was absorbed by 11 MCs leaving UGX.31.4Bn unspent due to delayed procurement of contractors by MoLHUD and delays in design review by the contractor.	
			was slow progress of work in 10 projects sampled in 11LGs with delays in works of up to 20 MonthsThere	
			Works had not commenced in Jinja City despite making advance payments of UGX.3.3Bn to the contractors.	
			In 4 LGs, UGX.44.7Bn which was unspent the previous year (FY2020/21) had not been re-voted by the time of writing this report.	
4	Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers	81.6	Out of the total receipts of UGX.81.6Bn, UGX.33Bn (40%) was utilised by the HLGs. Consequently, 39 projects in Education and 51 projects in health failed to utilise UGX.48.5Bn (60%).	
			I noted slow progress of works in 29 projects with delays ranging from 1 to 42 months.	
5	Development Response Displacement Impacts Projectto	211.9	Out of the total receipts only UGX.198.5Bn (94%) was spent, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.13.4Bn (6%) as a result, 46 subprojects in the Kamwenge and Kygegwa DLGs were not funded.	
			There were delays in implementation of the project due to late release of funds by OPM.	
			Under the Livelihoods Program, 307 (45%) subprojects groups that received UGX.12.8Bn in 8 districts had not commenced	
			Under the Sustainable environmental management, all the activities had not commenced in 336 subprojects in 13 DLGs that received UGX.18.6Bn.	
			By the end of the financial year, UGX.166.8Bn remained unutilized and was on the subprojects’/ subgroups’ bank accounts in several commercial banks.	
			57 subprojects that received funding totaling UGX.12.2Bn in 5 districts lacked environment and social management	
6	Support to organised groups for improvement of people’s livelihood	2.4	Only 318 (58%) out of a planned 543 Micro projects were funded with UGX.2.4Bn	
			UGX.201Mn was absorbed from UGX.2.4Bn received thus hindering the program objective of enhancing household incomes.	
			20 LGs delayed to disburse UGX.836Mn to 168 groups with delays of up to 9 months due to delayed receipt of funds from OPM.	
			UGX.248Mn was not accounted for in 7 LGs.	
			7 LGs failed to account for UGX.248Mn meant to support the implementation of micro projects in community based groups.	
			33 groups in 5 LGs were supported beyond the maximum funding threshold resulting into an excess payment of UGX.221Mn	
			I also conducted inspection of the projects an noted that 2 micro projects in Nakasongola DLG funded with UGX.25Mn were non-existent and 18 groups in 10 LGs implemented un- approved activities worth UGX.104Mn.	
7	Management of YLP and UWEP in Local Governments	0	At the time of funds worth UGX.164.99Bn and UGX.111.48Bn for YLP and UWEP respectively had been disbursed out of which UGX.38Bn and UGX.22.9Bn had been recovered for the	














	programmes	
Under YLP the recovery rate was only 23% of the amount due as at 30 th June 2022	
Under UWEP, the recovery was relatively fair at 71% of the amount that was due as at 30th June 2022.	
	Total	551.3		




The above weaknesses were mainly attributed to programme design challenges, delayed

dissemination of approved programmes designs and weaknesses in monitoring and supervision of implementation among others.

I advised the Accounting Officers to review the programme designs with the aim of

addressing some of the design challenges, ensure timely dissemination of programme information and enhance supervision and monitoring of the implementation of these projects.

Overall Conclusion

Government performed well in areas such; performance and absorption of warrants which performed at 95% and 91% respectively. However, I noted shortcomings such as; unsatisfactory alignment of the budget to the NDP-III, approval of supplementaries without

matching revenue, failure to implement planned activities, only 47% of LGs had their plans certified by NPA, off-budget financing in LGs, and challenges in service delivery among others.

However, government can perform better and improve budget credibility if the proposed recommendations are adopted.

1	Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Programme (MATIP) II	Construction of Busia Main market at Busia MC	20,771,165	Incomplete works of the daycare, police and health centre provisional areas. These areas were not tiled with poor wall finishing in the market cooling facility. This delayed provision of better working environment for the mothers, police and health workers at the market.	
2	Development Response to Displacement Impact Project (DRDIP)	Construction of Nyabyondo- Endinzi Town water supply and sanitation scheme	2,180,949	There were visible cracks on the walls in the manager’s office at the water office and some of the drainages around the water kiosks were silted and therefore not channelling waste water away. This affected the usability of the offices.	
3	Ministry of Local Government	Appropriate policies for effective governance and security in 12 Local Governments reviewed and developed.	393,423	Interviews with some of the participants revealed that some of the training expectations were not met. The anticipated benefit of equipping LGs with effective governance policies were not achieved since no needs assessment was done before the activity was undertaken.

5	Kampala Capital City Authority	Completed Phase-1renovation of a classroom block at Munyonyo	500,000	At the time of inspection, the renovated area had already developed cracks at the wall and floor. This will affect the usability of the Administration block.	
6	The Judiciary	ConstructionMagistrates Court at PatongoofChief	298,512	The masonry works (external walls and internal partitions) was visually of unsatisfactory quality. This was specifically observed in the bricklaying and concrete works, the strength of the wall therefore may be compromised in the near future.	
7	Office of the Prime Minister	Training of District Disaster Management Committees (DDMCs) and District Disaster Policy Committees (DDPC)	175,000	The anticipated benefit of equipping committees with knowledge in disasters were not achieved since the training did not address the needs of the participants.

2	The Uganda Police Force	Design and construction of Aviation Maintenance Base in Jinja	27,710,000	The project was expected to end by June 2020. The delayed completion of the aviation maintenance centre resulted in avoidable monthly rent for hiring a hangarage and accommodation. UGX.418,840,000 was incurred during the year on the same.
