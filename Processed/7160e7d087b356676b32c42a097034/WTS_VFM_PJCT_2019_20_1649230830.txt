REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ALBERTINE REGION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE, 2020

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Albertine Region Sustainable Development Project which comprise the statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June

2020, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and

Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then

ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Albertine Region Sustainable Development Project

for the year ended 30 th June 2020 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IPSASs for Cash accounting for Public institutions and section 51 of the Public Finance Management, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions

(ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s

Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Project in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit

Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants

Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe

that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.











key audit matter and during the office-wide planning, I identified risks common with MDAs which include; non-implementation of strategic plans, underperformance of

revenue, implementation of off-budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.

Based on the procedures performed, I noted that ARSDP has 3 Components and the MoES is implementing Component 3 which has two sub-components of; (a)

Improving BTVET institutions in the Albertine Region and (b) Improving access to relevant skills training programs through the provision of bursaries to people from the region.

To achieve this mandate, ARSDP planned to implement a number of both recurrent and development deliverables under various programs. A review of the Project’s work plan and budget revealed that the Project had an approved budget of UGX.6,982,369,000, out of which UGX.25,787,260,765 was released. The table below shows a summary of key deliverables of the Project for the financial year 2019/20.

1.1	Revenue Performance-for MDAsof GoU receipts The project budgeted to receive UGX.2.95Bn out of which UGX.2.84Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX. 0.11Bn which is 4% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect implementation of planned activities.underperformance was attributed to less Quarter 4 releases due to Covid-19 pandemic effects.indicated that they will continue to engage MoFPED to release the full GOU budget.PerformanceTheManagement						I advised the Accounting Officer to always engage the MOFPED to ensure they fulfil the project co- funding obligations.	
1.2	Under absorption of fundsof the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.25.79 bn, only UGX. 5.52Bn was spent by the project resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.20.27Bn representing an absorption level of 21%. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was carried forward to the next financial year. Refer to the table below;Year 2019/20APP EST (A) (UGX billions)RELEASE (B) billions)(UGX6.98 25.79Expenditure Unspent(C) billions) 5.52(UGX (B-C) billions) 20.27(UGX%21%under absorption of released funds was attributed to the late project implementation and covid-19 effects.absorption of released funds resulted into non-implementation of planned activities such as un implemented civil works in UTC- Kicwamba, UPIK and Nwoya, un-procured equipment and materials which were not undertaken during the year.explained that they have fast tracked procurement and signed contracts for civil works (2 out of 2) and equipment (1 out of 2). The remaining Equipment Procurement is currently at evaluation stage and contract signing is expected by end of January 2021. With all major contracts awarded, project absorption is expected to get back to schedule during FY 2020/21.OutThe UnderManagement						I advised the Accounting Officer to implement strategies that will accelerate the speed of implementation of project activities without compromising the quality the planned outputs.of	
								
								
								
								
1.3	Quantification of Outputs/Activities55 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the next quarter. These reports should indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure.Out of the Six (6) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure of UGX.5.64Bn sampled for assessment, I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted the following; Two (2) outputs with a total of four (4) activities and expenditureParagraph						I advised the Accounting Officer to clearly spell out planned outputs and the specific and accurate Key performance indicators in terms of quantity so as to clearly monitor and assess performance.	




absorption











of UGX 0.36Bn were fully quantified. That is, all the four (4) activities (100%) within these outputs were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance.

 Four (4) outputs with a total of ten (10) activities and expenditure of UGX 5.28Bn were insufficiently quantified. I observed that out of the ten (10) activities, Four (4) activities (40%) were quantified

while six (6) activities (60%) were not clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance

 There were no outputs that were not quantified at all.

Refer to Table 1 below for the summary of extent of quantification and

amounts spent.

involving various stakeholders in the oil and gas sector, Project Activities monitored by MoES officials and other stakeholders; Oil and Gas Skills Council facilitated; Purchase and installation of new curriculum machines and Scholastic & Laboratory equipment for the two Centers of Excellence under the Twinning arrangements procured

without specifying number/quantities achieved.

Failure to plan and report on the quality/quantity of activities

implemented renders it difficult to establish the reasonableness of individual activity costs for each planned output which curtails effective

accountability when funds are subsequently spent. Further, without

clearly and fully quantified outputs, I could not ascertain the level of achievement of these outputs and whether funds appropriated by

Parliament and released were spent and the intended objectives

achieved.

Management acknowledged the recommendation and would ensure out

puts are quantified in the subsequent budgets.

1.4 Implementation of Quantified outputs

I advised the Accounting Officer I assessed the implementation of two(2) out puts that were fully to always

quantified with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX 0.36Bn and implement

amounts spent.

Details in Appendix 1.to implement all planned activities and outputs was attributed to Covid-19 effects and delays in the procurement processes.explained that, the project activities are inter-related and therefore, incompleteness of one activity affects the completeness of others for example, civil works monitoring and supervision cannot be conducted unless construction is ongoing and training of instructors students cannot take place unless structure are complete. However, since Civil Works are already under execution stage, dependent activities shall be fast tracked during the FY 2020/21.Non-implementationFailureManagement											
1.5 Mischarges and Diversionnoted that funds to the tune of UGX 78,714,688 was irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Details of cases where this was observed are attached as Appendix 2.of funds is not only contrary to the Public Finance and Management Act, but it negatively affects the delivery of services and negates the purpose of budgeting. This was attributed to failure by the Project management to adhere to the financial management controls put in place.explained that this arose out of a rental emergency where the Landlord was threatening to close office premises. Having not realised a Q4 release, the funds were therefore borrowed from various programmes to avert eviction. The other payments such as imprest were project contributions towards operational funds that help to support the entire Ministry’s emergency activities including the project itself.I advised the Accounting Officer to always adhere to the budgeted work plan and charging of the correct expenditure codes.I DiversionManagement												
												
1.6 Preparation and submission of Monitoring plans and reports58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20 requires the Accounting officer to prepare and submit annual monitoring plans for government programs and or projects under his/her vote to the Office of the Prime Minister with a copy to Ministry of Finance, and National Planning Authority for harmonization to ensure proper coordination to avoid duplication and fatigue.

information and mislead users of the reports.

Management explained that they take note of this and that:-

IDA Funding

The Original closing date for ARSDP 31st July 2019; and according to

the project funds disbursement plan, ARSDP was expected to disburse US$1.2 equivalent to UGX.4.035Bn and this is the figure appearing in the Approved Estimates for the FY 2019/20.

Project extension was approved on 21st May 2019. AT this time the

Budget estimates for the FY 2019/20 had already been approved by Parliament; yet ARSDP required a bigger budget appropriation than the

above provision of UGX.4.035Bn.

On 24th May 2019, the Ministry wrote to the PS/ST (with a copy to OAG) requesting for uplifting of the Donor Budget appropriation. This

was followed by 2 reminders dated 6th August 2019 and 6th February

2020. However, the Ministry received no feedback from the PS/ST.

Meanwhile, project activities were going on. Based on the activity levels, World bank disbursed funds totaling to US$6.1 million (Equiv. UGX22.95) and this what was reported as ARSDP Revenue in the

financial statements for the FY 2019/20.

GOU Funding

As noted in issue 1.1 above, the difference between expenditure of

UGX 0.86bn and a release of UGX2.74 bn relates to Bursary Scheme funds reported in financial statements as project advances, since

scholarships had not taken place by 30th June 2020.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying my opinion, I draw attention to the following matters.

2.0. Expenditure Management 2.1. Ineligible expenditure : UGX.68,678,560











up the Albertine region and some selected officials from the Ministry of Education and Sports and it is eligible for IDA financing under the ARSDP under the budget lines of Travel Inland as well as Fuel, Lubricants and Oils.

Audit Remark

The IDA POM work plan indicated that under the bursary scheme, they only pay for the consultancy of the Bursary scheme which was awarded to KPMG while other

expenses are met by GOU funding.

I advised the accounting officer to ensure compliance with the terms of the financing

agreement to avoid distortions in planned outputs and loss of future financing opportunities.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries

by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I

do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the

other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact.

I have nothing to report in this regard.

Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and

Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of Albertine Region Sustainable Development Project.











Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as

a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an

auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect

a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:-  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for

my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is

higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty

exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Project’s

ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the

financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s

report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Project to cease to continue

as a going concern over the project period.

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.











Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on

my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised

in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters

are as follows;

3 .0. Inadequate Internal Audit reviews

Section II B (5) of Schedule 2 of the ARSDP Financing Agreement 2016, provides

that the recipient shall carry out Semi-annual internal audits under terms and

conditions satisfactory to the Association and furnish the related internal audit

reports to the Association not later than forty five days (45) days after the end of

each audit period. On the contrary, there was no evidence of regular internal audit

reviews carried out during the year under review.

Absence of regular internal audit reviews and assessments on the operations of the Project undermine the effectiveness of internal controls and It also implies that any

control weaknesses may not be addressed in a timely manner leading to ineffective Project implementation.

Management acknowledges the observation. However, the audits for the FY under

review were affected by COVID-19.

I advised the accounting officer to ensure adequate controls over the operations of

the project by ensuring regular internal audit reviews and assessments as required by the Financing agreement.
