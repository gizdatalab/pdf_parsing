1,"The Diesel Engines of the Locomotives are expected to Comply with the requirements of at Emission standards or Equivalent least,Tier-2",Do not Comply; The locomotives are fitted with EMD 16-645 E3B engines that are Tier 0+ to the centre,Tier The EMD 16-645-E3B are not -2 emission standard but zero plus standard. Tier -2 engines can only operate on high quality low Sulphur diesel which is not readily available in Uganda. Thus the EMD 16-645 E3B engines match the quality of fuel here.
2,"Engine Speed range between 1,000-1,800 rpm","Not Compliant, EMD 16- 6453BE engine; RPM range 200 idle to 950 Maximum",This was a typo as the low speed range of 200 to 1000 rpm is appropriate for big engines.
3,Sand box Capacity; 700kg (Minimum),"Not Compliant, Standard 8x35kg sand boxes=280kg. Larger Sandboxes will be manufactured, 2x50kg plus 6x100kg=700kg",Sand boxes were modified to capacity as indicated in the bid.
4,Fuel tanks are expected to be provided with calibrated fuel gauge with an accuracy capacity of 95%,"if required It is not standard on the locomotives of this supplier, but OEM fuel gauges N- Gauge are available to be fitted and displayed on the LDU for URC cost. Note it is not a consumption flow-meter, merely a fuel level gauge.",fuel tanks sight The have calibrated glass gauges from which fuel in the loco can be read.
5,"the heavy duty Battery The locomotives are expected to have storage batteries with high efficiency and adequate capacity for starting, lighting and other purposes necessary for controls of Low maintenance Ni-Cd batteries are preferred. locomotive.",New D/M390 lead acid batteries the locomotives have proved to be effective for around 3 years. Alternative batteries specified can be fitted with additional cost for URC fitted that to,Acid batteries are good enough and acceptable.
6,"Control Systems The Locomotives are expected to be of single driver cabin positioned at the front end of the locomotive, fitted with dual operating controls. cabin is expected to be fitted with two fans, shatter proof window, rear view mirror The",The company is not able to fit dual operating controls. The locomotives have right sided drivers positions only. fans but air-conditioning fitted. Shutter proof windows fitted and door glasses. No rear mirror but can be installed in line with No,Right sided drivers position will suffice. conditioner is a better alternative. Air
