I. Planning and Budgeting  
Whereas the Sector Development Plan (SDP) is in tandem with the long-term national development goals and objectives it was difficult to match the respective outputs in the NDPII and SDP. Additionally, in the Certificate of compliance issued by NPA 2017/18 it was observed that despite the good progress in the development of the sector plan, the plans are not translated into budget interventions necessary to achieve NDPII macroeconomic targets. It was also observed that the Ministry’s five year strategic plan is still in draft form In the absence of an approved strategic plan for the ministry, the ministry and indeed the sector may not be properly directed towards the achievement of the expected outputs given that the Ministry is responsible for policy formulation, legislation, strategic planning, setting standards, regulation, and monitoring and evaluation of the Sector.

II. Release Performance and Absorption  
The sectors’ approved budget for the year amounted to UGX.4.782 trillion, and UGX.4.260 trillion was released constituting 89% of the approved budget. Of the amount released, 89.4% was spent by the different entities under the works and transport sector.  
The budget shortfall of 11% was registered in external financing and this mainly affected UNRA where UGX 1,321,281,293,645 (68.5%) of the anticipated allocation from external financing was not realized; this. was caused by appropriating funds for the critical oil roads yet at the time of budget approval, Government was still in the process of securing the funding from EXIM bank and the process had not been finalised by end of FY 2017/2018. The MTEF figures for externally financed project are provided by the Ministry of Finance with limited input from UNRA. This created mismatch between the UNRA’s actual budget requirements and appropriation.

III.  
Re-allocation/virement worth UGX.15 billion The Ministry made reallocations amounting to UGX.15 billion to outputs that had not been initially planned but did not adjust the planned outputs to reflect the respective changes in budgetary allocations.

IV. Diversion of Funds  
There were instances of mischarge of expenditure to budget lines with no relation to the expenditure in question. This impacted on the financing of the planned activities resulting in some activities not being implemented. A total of UGX.24bn and UGX.281.67bn was found to have been diverted by MOWT and UNRA towards unrelated activities. Accounting Officers attributed this practice to budget constraints imposed by the MTEF limits issued by MOFPED and the priority demands accounting officers have to meet even in instances where resources are not forthcoming.

V.  
Inherent lags or delays in the procurement system and cost variations  
It was observed that delays in procurement affected timely delivery of outputs. In UNRA, procurement delays were mainly caused by administrative reviews and sometimes beauracratic processes to which procurements are subjected in fulfillment of the financing requirements.  
Despite funds being released for acquisition of land, there was minimal progress during the financial year 2017/2018 caused partly by disagreements over land ownership and land compensation rates.

VI.  
Monitoring and evaluation of implemented activities  
The Ministry developed a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework Policy. It was however noted that although the Ministry had a number of indicators that are being used to assess its annual performance like GAPR indicators set by OPM, MoFPED indicators, and those set within the Ministerial Policy Statement among others, the monitoring and evaluation framework had proposed use of only golden indicators for the assessment of performance.

For the case of UNRA, it was observed that despite its critical role in the organization, the M & E function is part of the larger Corporate Strategy Management department and with no funds specifically allocated to the M&E function. This has rendered it less effective in its day to day operations.

# CHAPTER ONE

### INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE AUDIT

The Works and Transport sector is one of the priority sectors of Government. It is led by the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) which is responsible for policy formulation, legislation, strategic planning, setting standards, regulation, and monitoring and evaluation of the Sector 2 . The other entities within the sector include, Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), Uganda Road Fund (URF), Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

## 1.2 MOTIVATION

Uganda’s national transport system is comprised of road, rail, air and inland water transport modes. With over 90% of cargo freight and passengers moving by road, road transport is the core and dominant mode of transport. Air and rail transport modes are still growing with limited utilisation while inland water transport is less developed. As a result, transport costs in Uganda have remained high in the region. The works and transport sector has been rightly identified, in the NDP II, as a complementary sector which supports the key growth sectors.

The SDP (2015/16-2019/20) and Annual Sector Performance Report 2016/17 highlights various challenges within the sector: Inadequate funding for road maintenance which has exacerbated the maintenance backlog of up to 51,735km on public roads estimated to cost UGX 600bn. High costs of acquisition of land for the right of way for the development of infrastructure projects; coupled with unfavourable land law affects budget performance especially for externally financed projects in terms of project costs and completion period.

Inadequate infrastructure therefore remains one of the binding constraints to the country’s economic growth with an estimated infrastructural financing gap of USD 0.4 billion per annum.

In a bid to meet this gap, it is imperative that available resources are efficiently and effectively utilised in order to close the existing infrastructural funding gap and spur economic growth.

Against this background the Office of the Auditor General decided to undertake a value for money audit to assess the extent of delivery of planned outputs by the ministry and other entities falling under the sector.

## 1.4 AUDIT OBJECTIVES

The objective of the audit was to assess the extent of delivery of key planned outputs by the works sector (with particular focus on MOWT and UNRA) for 2017/18.

## 1.4.1 Audit Questions

i)  
Is the sector plan linked to the National Development Plan II?  
ii)  
Are the set targets realistic and consistent? iii)  
Were the budgeted funds realized as planned and in a timely manner?  
iv) Were the released funds utilized for  
the intended purpose (are there diversions/ re-allocations, misappropriations of  
funds, instances of low absorption, mischarges/ misallocations, cost variations, delays in procurement?

- Are the priority projects properly monitored and evaluated?  

- Are adequate resources allocated for monitoring?  

- Are monitoring plans prepared and approved?  

- Are monitoring reports produced and acted upon?

## 1.5 AUDIT SCOPE

The key focus area was delivery of expected outputs in the works and Transport sector. For purposes of this study the ministry of Works and Transport and the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) were purposively selected as the sample for evaluation because their individual budgets cumulatively make up 90% of the sector budget.

Key priority programmes and sub programmes or projects under the two entities were assessed to ascertain the extent to which the planned sector objectives have been achieved and challenges experienced in their implementation were also noted. The audit covered one financial year of 2017/18.

### AUDIT METHODOLOGY

The audit was conducted in accordance with the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Performance Auditing Standards and the Value for Money Auditing guidelines prescribed in the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) VFM audit manual. The standards require that the audit is planned in a manner which ensures that an audit of high quality is carried out in an economic, efficient and effective way and in a timely manner.

2.1 Sampling  
Sampling materiality was considered in the context of quantitative and qualitative factors in selecting the sample for audit.  
For MDAs in the works sector, all entities whose individual budgets cumulatively make up 90% of the total sector budget were selected for audit. From the entities selected, any individual program with a budgeted/ actual expenditure/revenue that constitutes 25% or more of the total budgeted/ actual expenditure/ revenue was considered material. Any expenditures of capital nature were also selected for audit purposes. Recurrent expenditures/ outputs were selected based on their monetary value and their importance in terms of achievement of the strategic sector objectives. Priority was given to programs in their order of importance that link to the strategic plan and the national development plan.

## 2.2 Data Collection Methods

The data collection methods used to answer each audit question involved document review, conducting interviews and document review as shown in Table 2 below:

## 3.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION

## PLANNING and BUDGETING

*Indicator Setting and Validation*  
At the start of the budget planning calendar, MDAs are required to review the existing performance indicators for each output/outcome for use in the forthcoming financial year. MDAs then submit the validated indicators to the sector secretariats at the lead ministry for compilation and submission to the relevant desk officers at OPM for quality assurance. At OPM, the desk officers specifically check for relevancy; completeness; obsolete and missing indicators and mismatch of indicators as part of the quality control procedures. OPM then summons the National Monitoring and Evaluation Working Group (OPM, UBOS, NPA, and MoFPED) to review and submit the approved performance indicators to Budget Directorate of MoFPED for incorporation within the National budget and the budget reporting tool (Programme Budgeting System (PBS) formerly the Output budgeting tool (OBT)).  
The sector desk officers are required to upload the approved performance indicators by 15th November of the current financial year. The approval of the indicators is based on ensuring that the indicators are specific, measurable, achievable, reliable and timely, i.e. SMART beginning with the OPM desk officers and completed by the National Monitoring and Evaluation Working Group.

*Target Setting*  
MDAs are required to set the targets in line with the available resource envelope and capacity to implement the development objectives of the institution. The MDAs set the output/outcome indicator targets during the budget framework paper preparation process.  
The targets are further reviewed during the preparation of the ministerial policy statement by MDA in line with the appropriated resources. The set targets are forwarded to OPM for review and approval, and re-forwarded to MoFPED for input into the OBT/PBS.

*Budgeting*  
Each Accounting Officer in consultation with the relevant stakeholders prepares a Budget Framework Paper for the vote, taking into consideration balanced development, gender and equity responsiveness and submits it to the Minister by 15th November of the financial year preceding the financial year to which the Budget Framework Paper relates. The Budget Framework Paper is supposed to be consistent with the National Development Plan and with the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility. The Minister, with the approval of Cabinet, submits the Budget Framework Paper to Parliament by the 31st of December of the financial year proceeding the financial year to which the Budget Framework Paper relates.

BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION  
*Release of funds*  
After approval of the Budget Estimates by Parliament in May, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, issues a Budget Execution Calendar in June. The execution calendar communicates the Annual Quarterly Cash flow plan and the Operational and Administrative guidelines for budget implementation. The user department then submits requests for funds to implement an activity to the Accounting officer. The MDAs are however advised to hold regular internal meetings to review status of implementation of approved work plan from time to time. The meetings include: Departmental meetings, Directorate meetings, Senior Management Meeting and Top Management Meetings.

*Utilization of funds*  
After approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the Secretary to Treasury issues the annual cash flow plan of Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans and recruitment plans approved by Parliament. The annual cash flow plan issued forms the basis for release of funds by the Accountant General to the Accounting Officers. The Accounting Officer, based on the annual cash flow plan issued by the Secretary to the Treasury, plans and manages the activities as indicated in the policy statement of the vote. An accounting officer shall have the overall responsibility for the successful execution of the procurement, disposal and contract management processes in the procuring and disposing entity.

Parliament may, by resolution, authorize the Minister to reallocate funds from a vote to another vote where the functions of a vote are transferred to that other vote. A vote that does not expend money that was appropriated to the vote for the financial year at the close of the financial year is expected to repay the money to the Consolidated Fund.

The user department then submits requests for funds to implement an activity to the Accounting Officer. The Accounting Officer approves and the requisition is forwarded to Accounts for entry into the IFMS. The payment record is forwarded to the Head Accounts for approval, then to Accounting Officer for validation. The validated payment is then submitted to MFPED for approval. It takes 48 hours for a payment to mature from the time it is forwarded to MFPED. This was enforced to curb against fraudulent transactions.

MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION  
The Sector has a Monitoring and evaluation Framework and Policy. The framework has a set of 18 golden Indicators that provide an assessment of high-level performance of the individual Subsectors, and the Sector as a whole. The indicators measure a mixture of inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts.

The Ministry established a comprehensive Transport Sector Data Management System (TSDMS) which is used for performance Monitoring and evaluation. The TSDMS is a key component of the sector M&E system. The Sector also has a Sector M &E Committee which reports to the Sector Working Group on a regular basis.

Implementation of the works and transport sector development plan is monitored by top management, Sector Working Group, Office of the Prime Minister, National Planning Authority and the Parliament of Uganda. The top management and the SWG meetings are held on a monthly basis that is, every second Friday and the last Wednesday of the month respectively.

Sector Annual and mid-term reviews with all the relevant stakeholders are held to assess the implementation of the WTSDP. The reviews are also part of the Annual and Half-Year Sector Performance Reports. Annually the sector specifically holds the Joint Transport Sector Review to;  
i)  
Discuss the Annual Sector Performance Report for the previous Financial year; the ASPR feeds into the Government Annual Performance Report discussed during the cabinet retreat.  
ii)  
Review the implementation progress of the agreed actions in the JTSR Action Plan Matrix.  
iii)  
Prepare an Aide Memoire including a matrix of agreed actions for the next implementation period (yearly) between the Sector and Development Partners.

PERFORMANCE REPORTING  
The Heads of departments in MDAs prepare quarterly performance reports which are submitted to the responsible head of the department/vote function for validation and then to the planning unit for consolidation and quality assurance. If the planners find that the reports are not complete, a request for more information is made to the commitment control officers. Once the completeness and reliability checks have been completed by the planners, the performance reports are forwarded to the Accounting Officers for review and approval.  
In cases where inconsistencies are noted by the Accounting Officer the faulty reports are sent back to the MDA planners with comments. Once the comments are addressed, the reports are then resubmitted to the Accounting Officer for approval and onward submission to MoFPED and parliament respectively.

At MoFPED, the reports are reviewed by the Desk Officers and the Budget Monitoring Unit and issues of concern are brought to the attention of the relevant Accounting Officers for action. In addition to the submitting reports to MoFPED, MDAs are required to submit 6 months (Semi-Annual Government Performance Report and 12 months reports (Annual Government Performance Report) to OPM. A Cabinet retreat is held to review Government performance at half-year and after the end of year. The retreat is coordinated by Office of the Prime Minister.

All MDAs are required to prepare and submit quarterly performance reports to Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development by 30th of the First month of the preceding quarter e.g. the Third Quarter Report for the FY 2017/18 is required by 30th of April 2018.

### FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1

## BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION -DELIVERY OF EXPECTED OUTPUTS

Section 45 (3) of the PFMA 2015 states that the Accounting Officer shall enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a financial year, submitted under section 13 (15).

Section 21(1) of the Public Finance Management Act entrusts the Accounting Officers with the responsibility of planning and managing the entity activities as indicated in the policy statement of the votes based on the annual cash flow plan issued by the Secretary to . Budget estimates are based on outputs to be achieved for the financial year and during implementation, effort should be made to achieve the agreed objectives or targets of the entity within the availed resources.

Based on the work performed during the audit, it was established that overall the sector partially achieved its planned outputs for the year as indicated in the Table 3 below .  
The results are based on the sample of two major entities within the sector i.e. Ministry of works and Transport, and Uganda National Roads Authority.

Table 3: Achievement of a Selected Sample of Key Planned Outputs

| Entity | Total Sample | Achieved | Partially Achieved | Not Achieved | Unable to confirm |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| MoWT | 18 | 2 | 11 | 1 | 4 |  
| UNRA | 21 | 9 | 9 | 3 | 0 |  
| Totals | 39 | 11 | 20 | 4 | 4 |  
| % || 28.2% | 51.28% | 10.26% | 10.26% |  


The analysis in the table above indicates that 51.28% of the selected sample of key planned outputs was partially achieved; 28.2% achieved and 10.26% not achieved. For the four (4) outputs constituting 10.26% of the planned outputs, the audit team was not able to assess the extent of delivery of outputs due to lack of adequate performance information. This assessment is also consistent with the Certificate of Compliance 2017/18 by National Planning Authority which showed that the sector was 54.4% compliant in terms of implementation of the budget.

At the entity level, from the review of the Ministry’s performance reports together with the relevant supporting documents and audit inspections, the audit established that the ministry partially achieved most of the key planned outputs for the year 2017/18. Table 4 below (details in Appendix II) summarizes the results of the review of the implementation of the selected sample of key priorities planned by the Ministry.

The analysis from the table above shows that whereas the ministry was able to fully achieve 2 of its planned outputs, the majority were not achieved or implemented mainly because funds were applied towards other unplanned activities.

In the case of UNRA, the review of the ministerial policy statements, approved budget, expenditures and UNRA performance reports for the sampled projects revealed that the actual outputs largely varied with the planned/ budgeted outputs as indicated in the Table 5 below and Appendix III for details.

Source: OAG Analysis of planned outputs

As shown in the table above, UNRA was able to fully achieve 9 out of the 21 sampled outputs. Nine (9) were partially achieved and three (3) not implemented because funds were applied towards other unplanned ac- tivities, untimely release of funds, and project delays.

Through document review and analysis; and interviews the audit identified a number of factors that impacted on the achievement of the planned outputs for the sector. Discussed below are some of the contributing factors arising from the review of the process of planning, budgeting, funds release and utilization; monitoring and evaluation; and performance reporting.

## 4.1.1 Planning and Budgeting

The Public Finance Management Act 2015) requires preparation of a National Budget in consultation with stakeholders. Section 13 (6) requires that the annual budget is consistent with the National Development Plan. This alignment also ensures accurate reporting of the outputs and outcomes planned in the NDPII at sector and MDA planning level.

It was noted that whereas the sector development plan is in tandem with the long-term national develop- ment goals and objectives of the sector, it was difficult to match the outputs in the NDPII and SDP to the

respective outputs as set out in the ministerial policy statement of the sector. Table 6: Showing mismatch in outputs

| NDP Outcome indicators | SDP Outcome Indicators | MPS output indicator |  
|---|---|---|  
| Proportion of passenger traffic by rail, road and water | Volume of passengers transported by road, rail, air and water transport. | Development of inland water trans- port; maintenance of aircrafts; Border post construction |  
| Percentage of outcome indicators achieved against target 1. | Proportion of outcome indicators achieved. | Development of policies, laws, guide- lines, plans and strategies. |  
| Percentage of construction works executed by locals | Percentage and value of construction works executed by the local contrac- tors. | Monitoring compliance of construc- tion standards and undertaking research |  
| Number of reported road, water, railway and lives lost. | Trend of road, railway, air and water accident occurrence. | Development of policies, laws, guide- lines, and strategies |  


Source: NDPII Implementation Strategy, SDP and MPS

Additionally, in the Certificate of compliance issued by NPA 2017/18 it was observed  
that despite the good progress in the development of the sector plan, the existing weaknesses in planning at sector level contribute towards the dismal level of performance of macroeconomic targets as plans are not translat- ed into budget interventions necessary to achieve NDPII macroeconomic targets. For example the NPA notes that whereas the sector prioritizes most of the NDPII interventions, a number remain unbudgeted, these include: i) Promote vehicle efficiency and technologies; ii) Review of road construction Designs and Standards; iii) Improve institutional planning, monitoring & performance evaluation; iv) Strengthening the transport planning function of the MWT; v) Survey, map and Install navigation Aid on inland water- ways; and vi) Increase awareness & advocacy in safety of inland water and rail transport.

Furthermore the audit established that the ministry’s five year strategic plan is in draft form and its fi- nalization and approval has since not been prioritized in-spite of the budget allocation of UGX 518 million that was earmarked for budget preparatory activities. Through document review, the audit team also noted that only UGX.156,529,000 was spent on the preparation activities .The balance of UGX 357,338,162 was spent on non-related activities such as allowances for police guards, procurement of printers and tonner, repair of protocol cars, contract gratuity, force on account salaries, supply of spare parts. Without an approved strategic plan the ministry may not be properly directed towards the achievement of the national development objectives. It also creates challenges in reporting on the performance of the sector/ministry.

## Management Response

While there are existing weaknesses in planning at Sector level, the interventions cited in the NDP II as un- budgeted were budgeted for under various programs and sub programs being implemented by the Ministry. By the end of FY 2017/18, the Ministry Strategic Plan had progressed to draft stage and was reviewed and cleared by NPA on October 24, 2018. Comments from NPA were incorporated; the Strategic Plan is ready for approval by the Top Management Team.

Part of the funds in addition to the budget preparatory activities were to be spent on activities of the Joint Transport Sector Review (JTSR) workshop for FY 2016/17, Sector coordination, preparation of the Sector quarterly performance reports as indicated under “Programme: 0449 Policy, Planning and Support Ser- vices Output: 05 Strengthening Sector Coordination, Planning & ICT” in the MPS for FY 2017/18. Manage- ment notes the recommendation of the AG to use resources earmarked for planning and budgeting for the intended purposes and will comply.

## Conclusion

The existing weaknesses in planning, and lack of a ministry strategic plan makes it difficult for the ministry to set realistic goals that will contribute to the national development agenda. In addition evaluation of the progress of planned interventions becomes difficult.

## Recommendations

The Ministry should;

- Annually Prioritize and budget for all those key priority interventions proposed in the NDPII and sector plans.
- Expedite the approval of the ministry strategic plan.
- Ensure proper alignment of the ministry plan with the sector plan in terms of outputs.
- Ensure that resources earmarked for planning and budget are utilized for the intended purpose.

## 4.1.2 Release Performance and Absorption

It was observed that overall the approved budget for the sector amounted to UGX.4.782trillion, and UGX.4.260 trillion was released constituting 89% of the approved budget .Out of the amount released 89.4% was spent by the various entities under the works and transport sector.  
Set out in Table 7 below is an analysis of the budget outturn for the MOWT and UNRA for the period under review

Value For Money Audit Report on Budget Performance in the Works and Transport Sector \| A Report by the Auditor General

---

As shown in the table above, the Ministry approved budget for the financial year was UGX. 487.111 bn expected to be financed by GOU and external financing to the tune of UGX.250.547bn and UGX.236.564bn respectively .Over 50.% of the budget was realized from GOU and external financing (15.78%).  
Records showed that almost all the amount released from GOU and external funders was spent during the year.

The shortfalls in external funding (67.5%) affected implementation of key planned outputs such as SGR and development of Bukasa Port in the case of MOWT.  
In the case of UNRA, over 65.62% was realized from GOU and external funders. Of the amount released, UNRA was able to utilize 93.96%. UGX.153,101,449,686 (6%) of the total release was not utilized of which UGX.218,357,189 (0.14%) was swept back to Treasury. The budget shortfall in UNRA mainly affected the planned land acquisition.

Through interviews and document review it was established that the budget shortfalls were mainly a ttributed to mismatch between funds disbursement schedule and the actual project work plans of MoWT and UNRA. In the case of UNRA the shortfall was also caused by delays in securing funding from EXIM bank.

## Management Response

According to UNRA, the road fund release came very late. The UGX.2,907,291,011 that remained on the account was part of UGX.18bn that was received on 26th June 2018 three days to closure of the financial year. UNRA didn’t have adequate time to fully utilize the funds.

ADB releases funds to last a period of 12 months while World Bank releases for a period of 6 months. Much of the money on the account was received in the month of May 2018.  
The bounced payments have since been investigated and repaid.  
IFMS registration is an ongoing process and challenges are resolved as they appear. Some suppliers don’t have the basic requirements like TIN which makes the process lengthy.

## Conclusion

The shortfalls in external funding affected implementation of the key planned outputs for the sector such as the SGR and development of Bukasa port, for the case of UNRA, acquisition of a total of 570.66 hectares of land specifically for oil roads was not undertaken.

## Recommendation

The Ministry should ensure that the agreed arrangements for external financing are adequately planned and operationalized in time in order to address the shortfalls in external financing and funds absorption

4.1.3 Re-allocation/virement  
The Public Finance and Management Act, provides for reallocations in instances where there are approved changes in the annual plans of the ministries, agencies and departments.  
The Treasury Accounting Instructions, 2017 stipulates that the Accounting Officer of the vote where the funds have been transferred shall revise his or her work plans and corresponding outputs to reflect the reallocation.

23 A Report by the Auditor General

---

During the audit it was established that the MOWT made reallocations amounting to shs15 billion to outputs that had not been initially planned. The funds were allocated from various programs such as development of the SGR; Rehabilitation of Boarder Posts; Urban road rehabilitation and construction among others towards new activity outputs that included: Revival of National Airline (7bn); Refund to M/S Krone (U) Limited (2bn); and Drainage of Namanve (6bn).  
However, management did not adjust the planned outputs to reflect the respective changes in budgetary allocations. It was also noted that in spite of the re-allocation of some budgeted funds, the planned outputs were to a large extent achieved as detailed in Appendix I.

## Management Response

Management faced a number of challenges during budget implementation.These were one off payments (like revival of the National Airline, desilting of Namanve) and management could not foresee these expenditures. It is true that management did not adjust the corresponding outputs after reallocation. Management commits its self to make realistic budget estimates in the subsequent Financial Years.

## Conclusion

Reallocation of a significant amount of the budget affected the achievement of the planned outputs for the year.

## Recommendation

The Ministry should;  
a)  
Ensure that where reallocations have been approved, the corresponding outputs are adjusted to reflect the new outputs.  
b)  
Develop a more realistic budget to avoid significant deviations from the annually planned activities.

## 4.1.4 Diversion/Mischarge of Funds

The Parliament of Uganda appropriates funds in accordance with the needs of the country and this appropriation is implemented through the budget in which funds are tagged to particular activities and outputs using account codes and MTEF codes.  
The review of the expenditure and the budget codes against which it was coded revealed instances of mischarge of expenditure to budget lines with no relation to the expenditure in question. This impacted on the financing of the activities of the two entities resulting in some activities not being implemented.

| Entity | Approved Budget (UGX)Bn. | Mischarge/Diversion ( UGX) Bn. |  
|---|---|---|  
| MOWT | 487.111 | 24.1 |  
| UNRA | 3,861.0 | 281.6 |

As an example, the MOWT made payments in settlement of domestic arrears to a tune of UGX.10.88bn against a budgetary provision of only UGX.350,212,216 as shown in the table below;

Table 8: Unappropriated domestic arrears

The settlement of arrears without recourse to approved budgetary provisions affected performance of some of the planned activities as shown in Appendix II.

In the case of UNRA, a review of the entity payment file for the selected sub-programs revealed that the en- tity utilized a total of UGX.281,674,619,369 meant for certain projects to towards financing other non-related projects as indicated in Appendix III.

Value For Money Audit Report on Budget Performance in the Works and Transport Sector \|  
25 A Report by the Auditor General

---

Through document review and interviews, it was established the diversions are mainly attributed to inadequate budget allocations imposed by the MTEF limits issued by ministry of finance and the demanding priorities that have to be timely met by the accounting officers even where the required funding is not forthcoming.

## Management Response MOWT Response

Due to pressure from the agitated service providers, the Ministry engaged MoFPED through various correspondences requesting for additional resources to settle these outstanding bills. Consequently, MoFPED advised the Ministry to prioritize its expenditure to fit within the available resource envelope; and accordingly the Ministry settled part of the outstanding bills of UGX 10.88bn. This was done to avert court litigation; attachment of Government property and freezing of Ministry Accounts. In addition the Ministry did so to avert further accumulation of accrued interest on unpaid bills.  
However, during FY 2018/19, MoFPED has provided UGX.6.0bn to offset some of domestic arrears. In addition, management has instituted stringent controls by ensuring that contracts are only signed based on actual cash flows rather than the approved budget.

## Response by UNRA

The annual MTEF ceiling for UNRA is not adequate for all works. As a result the funds are spread thin to different projects. In addition lack of flexibility in the current line item budgeting system compound the challenge of resource deployment. This practice is also caused by quarterly release limitations which force management to charge items with cash balances for funding other entity operations. Further, insufficient budget allocations and severe cuts in consumptive areas by Ministry of Finance coupled with land grievance issues impair the absorption of funds as planned.

## Conclusion

A substantial part of sector budget was not utilized towards intended activities. Diversion of funds within the sector had an impact on the delivery of the Planned Outputs. The practice impacts on the credibility of the budget and undermines the intentions of the appropriating authority. It also results in misleading reported performance information.

## Recommendations

The sector in particular MOWT and UNRA should;  
a)  
Annually prioritize and adequately budget for all those key priority interventions agreed during the year.  
b)  
Continue engaging the responsible authorities to streamline the entity budget allocations and disbursements to enable them manage their cash flow efficiently.  
c)  
Ensure that resources earmarked for delivery of particular outputs are utilized for the intended purpose.  
d)  
Work with the responsible stakeholders to ensure that impediments to budget implementation such as land compensations are expeditiously addressed.

## 4.1.5

Inherent lags or delays in the procurement system and Land Acquisition  
Section 48 of the PPDA Act, 2003 requires that all procurement and disposal should be conducted in a manner which promotes economy, efficiency and value for money.  
It was observed that delays in procurement in the sector affected timely delivery of outputs. Under UNRA procurement delays have been mainly caused by administrative reviews and sometimes the bureaucratic processes procurements are subjected to in fulfillment of the financing requirements.

26

Value For Money Audit Report on Budget Performance in the Works and Transport Sector \| A Report by the Auditor General

---

The analysis also showed that despite funds being released for acquisition of land, there was minimal progress during the financial year 2017/2018 caused partly by disagreements over the ownership of land and the land compensation rates in various regions. For example in the Albertine area the Oil Companies had to set up the Central Processing Facility in Buliisa that resulted in the need for UNRA, CGV and the oil companies to harmonize land acquisition rates. Similarly for Kampala Jinja expressway, the delay was due to land conflicts.

Under MOWT, the design of the Uganda Computerized Driving Permit premises was affected by procurement delays and cost variations. The ministry had planned to spend UGX.1bn on the designs. However the actual execution of the work required about UGX.1.8bn which caused a variation in the planned cost leading to delay in procurement of the contractor. A market survey was eventually carried out to establish how much was required for the design of the UCDP.

Activities like maintenance of aircrafts for East African Civil Aviation Authority (Soroti) were also partially achieved due to delays in procurement. For instance Procurement number EACAA/SUPLS/17-18/00283 was initiated on 6th March 2018 and signed on 16th August 2018 six months after initiation there-by causing a delay in the above mentioned output.

## Recommendation

The Ministry should ensure that procurements are undertaken within the timelines prescribed in the procurement regulations. This will also require establishment of a mechanism to routinely monitor the time taken throughout all the procurement processes.  
The Ministry together with UNRA should continue engaging the responsible authorities to address the impediments to land acquisition for infrastructure projects.

## 4.1.6 Monitoring and Evaluation of Implemented Activities

MOWT has developed the monitoring and evaluation framework Policy. It was however noted that although the ministry has developed a number of indicators that are being used to assess its annual performance like GARP indicators set by OPM; MoFPED indicators and those set within the ministerial policy statement among others, the monitoring and evaluation framework has proposed use of only golden indicators for the assessment of performance.  
The audit team further established through document review that although the ministry planned for monitoring and evaluation activities to a tune of UGX.213m for the year under the department of Policy, Planning and Support Services, the amount released for the purpose amounting to UGX.237,888,960 was spent on other activities.  
There was no evidence in form of monitoring reports to confirm that monitoring activities had been carried out as planned. In addition interviews held with the planning unit indicated that there were no specific monitoring work plans with clear targets and indicators to facilitate monitoring activities.  
The planning team also indicated that monitoring was being undertaken on adhoc basis. For the case of UNRA, document reviews and interviews indicated that the M & E function in UNRA is part of the Corporate Strategy Management department with three functions namely; Strategy, Risk management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Budgeting is done for the entire department; however no funds are specifically tagged to the Monitoring & Evaluation function despite its critical role in every organization. Therefore the key M&E outputs and allocations needed to drive the outputs could not be clearly identified. In addition, there were no M&E reports availed to the audit to assess the extent of implementation of M&E activities.

27 A Report by the Auditor General

---

## Management Response

The Office of the Prime Minister requested all Accounting Officers to work with MoFPED, NPA and UBOS to review their Sector indicators in line with the National Standard Indicators Framework. The Sector standardized the Sector indicators and submitted them on February 21, 2018 and additionally November 08, 2018. The indicators were revised in the PBS during the budgeting process for FY 2019/20. Chapter 2 of the Sector M&E Framework 2018 includes the various indicators i.e. NDP II, Programme Based Budgeting (PBB), Government Annual Performance Report (GAPR) and the Golden indicators. The chapter further illustrates how and when these indicators are used and how they feed into the Annual Sector Performance Report.

The Ministry undertakes monitoring of its activities and prepares monitoring reports. For the funds in question, a substantial portion was spent on the annual Joint Monitoring Exercise for projects undertaken in FY 2016/17. This is an exercise where stakeholders conduct joint monitoring of Sector activities.

Management however recognizes there are still weaknesses in this area (both human and financial). Going forward, in the recent restructuring, the Ministry created a division for Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation to strengthen the M&E function. Recruitment of key staff is already underway.

## Conclusion

The existing gaps in the M&E function in the sector impede proper functioning of the M&E functions. This means that performance gaps in the delivery of planned outputs cannot be timely identified and corrected.

## Recommendations

The Ministry and UNRA should;  
a)  
Standardize all the indicators used in performance reporting to avoid inconsistencies in performance reporting.  
b)  
Monitor activities are streamlined by having annual work plans with clear indicators and targets.  
c)  
Ensure that funds for monitoring activities are utilized for intended purpose.  
d)  
Ensure that monitoring reports are prepared and properly filed as a basis for proper accountability.

## 4.2 PERFORMANCE REPORTING

As explained above, the sector has developed a number of indicators used to assess its performance.  
The indicators are categorized as below;  
*OBB indicators:* These are output-based indicators set by MoFPED for a specific entity.  
*Golden Indicators:* These were agreed upon by the Transport Sector Working Group to assess its performance as a sector. It should be noted that some of the golden indicators double as GAPR indicators as well. The purpose of these indicators is to demonstrate sector wide performance aimed at overall strategic management, including the review of related policy issues. These were adopted in 2011.  
*GAPR indicators:* These are developed by OPM to monitor and evaluate performance of all government sectors. GAPR uses indicators which report on outcomes and output indicators to be compared with budget. *National Partnership Forum indicators:* These are mainly with development partners and specific to the projects being undertaken.  
It was observed that these indicators are stated and described differently in the various reports and planning documents.

Source: OAG Analysis

The lack of standardization of indicator setting makes it difficult for MDAs to relate the expenditure activities to output/outcome indicators in the various performance reports. It may also result in inconsistencies in the reported performance information.

To check on the accuracy and completeness of the reported performance information, the audit team reviewed the sector performance report and checked whether the outputs reported were properly supported. Inspections were also undertaken to confirm existence and implementation of some of the activities reported. It was observed that there were inconsistences in reporting on delivery of outputs and in some cases there was no linkage between planned outputs and actual reported achievements.  
For example in MoWT whereas the performance report 2017/18 indicates that UGX.243.3bn was spent, the financial statements indicate UGX.243.783bn (Statement of Financial Performance). Additionally, whereas the East African Civil Aviation Authority (MOWT) indicates that all the 9 aircrafts had been maintained as per their plan, audit inspections revealed that 4 aircrafts had been maintained at the time of the audit. Through field inspections it was noted that there were instances where the actual outputs delivered were not accurately reported as shown in Appendix V.

## Management Response

The ministry has taken steps to harmonize the NDP II, GAPR, PBS, and National Standards Indicators. Management has noted the observations and recommendations of the AG and will ensure that the various reporting systems are harmonized in order to provide consistence in reporting.

## Conclusion

The lack of standardization of indicator setting makes it difficult for the ministry to relate the expenditure activities to outputs/outcome indicators in the various performance reports.

## Recommendations

The Ministry should;  
a)  
Standardize indicator setting to enhance performance reporting.  
b)  
Ensure that performance is accurately reported to inform appropriate government policy actions.

## ANNEXTURE

## FIELD INSPECTION REPORT

Following a site visit to selected projects under the mantle of MoWT, following is the report detailing the status as at the time of field inspection.

## a) Main building at Lukaya market

This project was under the supervision of the department of public structures, MoWT. Contract details

| Client | MoWT |  
|---|---|  
| Works Contract Number | MoWT/WORKS/14-15/00340 |  
| Supervisor | CMT (MoWT) |  
| Works contractor | Sumadhura Technologies ltd |

| Works Contract signature date | 17th May 2016 |  
| Works Contract Commencement date | 8 June 2016 |  
| Works Contract duration | 12 months |  
| Original Works Completion date | 8 June 2017 |  
| First revised Works Completion date | 28 Dec 2017 |  
| Second revised Works Completion date | 28 April 2018 |  
| Amount certified todate | 1,357,286,493 |  
| % Progress reported | 75% |  
| % progress (financial) | 64% |  
| Time lapse at time of audit | 200 days |  


## Scope of project

Completion of phase 1 works  
Construction of worktops on existing stalls Construction of splash aprons  
Floor and worktops finishes on the existing structures Completion of ablution areas

## Phase 2 works

Construction of a block of shops and lock-ups  
Construction of parking lots and garbage skips  
Electro-mechanical installations, fittings and fixtures for water and power installations

## Findings

Fundamental breach of contract by the contractor  
The advance payment and performance guarantees expired and the contractor did not have them renewed despite the project time getting multiple extensions of time. Non-renewal of securities constitutes a fundamental breach of contract by the Contractor (GCC 59.2 (f)) and the Client should therefore begin proceedings for termination of contract.

Unsupportable duration for liquidated damages  
A review of the contract for works established that while the contract duration was 12 months (365) days initially, the days upon which liquidated damages would be charged were 520 days (SCC 49.1). This is an anomaly which gave the contractor extra time to complete remaining works after the duration of contract that was more than the actual contract time. This allowance gave no incentive to the contractor to complete on time.

Absence of critical project documentation during construction  
It was observed that the project personnel did not have the project information on site in form of drawings and specifications necessary for construction and installation of critical facilities. The site personnel did not know the features of the project neither did they have the drawings and specifications.

Inspection  
It was intended that Lukaya market would be constructed and handed over to beneficiaries by the end of the financial year (17/18). While the project was to have been completed by April 2018, the project was still incomplete as of November 2018.  
In addition, at the time of site inspection, the market was not yet open to use. Outstanding works remain on the walkways and general landscaping works. The electro-mechanical installations are not yet complete. The following pictures illustrate the status as found (façade works and walkway construction).

Defective works on concrete on the ring beam (LHS & RHS)

## b) District roads

These were all procured under the force account mechanism. Documentation relating to usage was only availed for the Luwero projects. All scheduled were completed on time except the Gulu High School road which did not have a second seal for all but 0.5Km. It was intended that all the district roads planned be fully completed for the financial year. The following sampled districts were visited to ascertain project status as of November 2018.
