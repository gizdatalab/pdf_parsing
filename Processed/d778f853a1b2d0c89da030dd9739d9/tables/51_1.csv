0,Monitoring and Evaluation,"To ensure effective monitoring of the national health strategy, the MoH developed the M&E plan for the HSDP with clear indicators and targets for assessing performance and ensure availability of accurate and timely information on health sector performance. All programs and projects are also expected to develop specific program/project M&E work plans which should include programme indicators to measure process, outputs and immediate outcomes. These should, however, be aligned with the goal, objectives and strategic interventions of the HSDP to demonstrate the effects of health system strengthening to health outcomes. At the national level, Bi-annual internal reviews by Sector Working Groups are carried out and include collating input and output performance data for key results as defined in Sector Investment Plans and the sector reporting framework. The bi-annual review includes all relevant sector stakeholders. The review focuses on the timeliness and accuracy of the collated performance data, before its upwards reporting, and recommendations for any corrective measures in the coming half year are made. In addition to public institutions and executing agencies, citizens, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Development Partners (DPs) play a role in the monitoring and evaluation of Governmentâ€™s performance. These institutions provide an external perspective on Government performance and results; assist Government through financial, technical and other forms of assistance to strengthen its performance."
1,Performance Reporting,"All MDAs are required to prepare and submit quarterly performance reports to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development by 30th of the first month of the preceding quarter e.g. the Third Quarter Report for the FY 2018/19 is required by 30th of April 2019. At MoFPED, the reports are reviewed by the Desk Officers, and the Budget Monitoring Unit and issues of concern are brought to the attention of the concerned Accounting Officers for action. In addition to the submitting reports to MoFPED, MDAs are required to submit six months (Semi-Annual Government Performance Report and 12 months reports (Annual Government Performance Report) to Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). A Cabinet retreat is held to review Government performance at half-year and after the end of the year and the retreat is coordinated by Office of the Prime Minister."
