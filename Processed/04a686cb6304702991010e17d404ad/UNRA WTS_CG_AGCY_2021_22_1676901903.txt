REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF UGANDA NATIONAL ROADS AUTHORITY

(UNRA) FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE, 2022

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Uganda National Roads Authority which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June, 2022, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Uganda National Roads Authority for the financial year ended 30 th June, 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of Uganda National Roads Authority in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matter Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.











i. Work closely with the Attorney General to prepare a cabinet paper on the legal reviews and amendment for UNRA. ii. Work closely with Ministry of Works and Transport (WoWT) to develop modalities of transferring assets and liabilities from UNRA and iii. Harmonize pay for the mainstreamed staff in line with the salary structure of MoWT. All these activities have not yet been undertaken by the time of reporting in December 2022. Under the circumstances, there is material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt that the Authority shall remain a Going Concern in the foreseeable future. My opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

2.0

Implementation of the approved budget

Paragraph 2 of schedule 5 of the PFMA requires Accounting Officers to prepare an appropriation account showing the services for which the money expended were voted, the sums actually expended on each service and the state of each vote compared with the amount appropriated for that vote by Parliament.

Over the years, I have observed improvements in the performance regarding implementation of the budget but entities still face a number of challenges including COVID-19, which continue to affect implementation of activities, service delivery and credibility of the budget. It is against this background that budget performance was considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning. I reviewed documents such as work plans, performance reports, conducted interviews and physical inspection in arriving at my findings.

UNRA is mandated under the UNRA Act 2006 to manage, maintain and develop the national roads network.

The entity had an approved budget of UGX.3,654,658,940,745 out of which UGX.3,150,755,611,035 was warranted. The entity's key deliverables for the financial year under review are detailed in the table below;

I reviewed the implementation of the approved 2021/2022 budget by the entity and noted the following;

SN	Observations	Recommendation	
2.1	Revenue Performance Performance of GoU receipts According to the revised approved budget, the entity expected to receive UGX.3,654,658,940,745 out of which UGX.3,150,755,611,035 was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.503,903,329,710 representing 14% of the approved budget.a result, a number of certificates of work completed remained un paid at the close of the financial year, which may cause increased road construction costs in form of interest payments for delayed settlement of the contractors’ claims.Accounting Officer explained that management will continue to engage Ministry of Finance for full release of funding.AsThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to continue engaging with MoFPED to ensure that GoU funds are released as planned.	
2.2	Utilization of warrants Out of the total warrants of UGX.3,150,755,611,035 received during the totalling UGX.2,662,030,909,590 of UGX.488,724,701,445 representing an absorption level 84.5%. The un- utilized warrants in-respect of GOU funding of UGX.8,435,300,871 were swept back to the Consolidated Fund as required by the PFMA.the entity resultingsubmitted in un-utilized warrantsfinancial year, invoicedto utilize all warrants results into failure to implement all planned activities.Accounting Officer explained that out of the UGX.488,724,701,445 of the un-utilised cash limit, UGX.480,258,177,195 was under external financing whereas UGX.8,435,300,871 was under GoU relating to unutilised funds on wage and forex differences arising from payments made at end of Financial Year 2022. It was further explained that the unspent cash limit amounting to UGX.480,258,177,195 under external financing remained with the Development partners. The under absorption of funds was largely attributed to funding shortfall under counterpart financing especially land acquisition resulting from budget suppression.FailureThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that all funded activities are implemented.	
2.3	Implementation of outputs and activities I assessed the implementation of 13 projects with a total of twenty six (26) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of fifty three (53) activities worth UGX.1,473Bn and noted that;Nine (9) outputs with nineteen (19) activities worth UGX.154Bn were fully implemented.  Sixteen (16) outputs with thirty three (33) activities worth UGX.1,285Bn were partially implemented. Out of the thirty three (33) activities, the entity fully implemented seven (7) activities; twenty five (25) activities were partially implemented, while one (1) activity remained un-implemented.	I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the responsible parties to ensure that the activities are implemented as planned.

Since funds for the activity were released then diversion could not be ruled outAccounting Officer explained that the outputs that were partially implemented was due to delays in relocation of utilities, inadequate mobilization due to Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, which affected progress of works on some of the projects. It was further explained that some projects suffered delays due to encumbrances, which affected access to sites for the contractors because of non- compensation challenges arising from inadequate funds while others suffered inadequate release of funds and delays by the World Bank in approval of the ESIA specifically under NERAMP for the road and sources of materials.Fully outputs 1Partially Implemented outputs 2Outputs Implemented 3implemented 9 33 154 10.5 19 19 0 16 50 1,285 87.2 33Not 1 17 34 2.3 10 117025 0Total 26 100 1,47 100 53 26 25 2 3Details Non-implementationThe

The diversion of funds impacts negatively on the performance of implementation of the project activities and may lead to increased construction costs in the form of interest payments in situations where funds for the affected projects are not available to pay the certificates of works.

Management explained that they always seek and obtain approval for reallocation within the thresholds of 10% per budget line. However, where it is unavoidable and the situation warrants going beyond this threshold, UNRA Management has always consulted and will continue to consult the Board and the PS/ ST before taking a decision of this nature. In this instance, consultation was done with the PS/ ST before the decision was made.

The Accounting Officer responded that the underestimations had been done by external consultants and that UNRA has since reinforced its design department to either undertake designs in-house or better check the designs by the Consultants for adequacy and completeness which is already showing positive results.

I advised the Accounting Officer to institute penalties for those consultants whose negligence in omitting obvious elements results in high cost variations for these projects during implementation.

- For Kapchorwa - Suam project where the access to site delayed from 21 days to 441 days from Km 42 to Km 73.
- Tirinyi –Pallisa-Kumi where delays led to payment of UGX.4,563,236,836 for time related obligations











 Pallisa - Kamonkoli where access delays led to payment of UGX.1,075,035,660
for time related obligations
 Kitala – Gerenge due to delayed land acquisition of right of way
 Rukungiri-Kihihi/Ishasha where a delay of 70 days was initially experienced and
later increased due to non-compensation of project affected persons.
 Kampala Northern By-pass where access was achieved 5 years into
implementation
The Accounting Officer responded that the internal design review and approval
processes had been improved for later projects The delays had been caused by
missing components such as hydrology, increased scope of services, and delayed
investigations due to un-acquired road corridor without which a submission could not
be made.
I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the consultant submits required
deliverables within contractual timelines The consultants should also be held
responsible for delays due to delayed issuance of designs.

The Accounting Officer indicated that it was not practically possible to issue commencement orders with fully accessible sites because there was a time limit within which to commence the contract after signature and delays in land acquisition due to inadequate funding and late releases. The Accounting Officer also promised to ensure that at least 30% of a continuous section of the site is accessible before signing the contracts.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure sites are accessible before issuing commencement orders that have cost implications in case of delays.

2.4.3 Delays in completion of design reviews

I found delays in completion of design reviews which delayed timely issuance of instructions to Contractors. This was observed on the following projects

- Kapchorwa Suam project where the design review report was submitted 24 months after the expected date. The Client took more 7 months before final review
- Kigumba Bulima where the design review report delayed by 24 months
- Rukungiri Kihihi Ishasha/Kanungu where the final design review report was delayed by 16 months
- Kampala Northern Bypass where the design review report delayed by 6 months

- Kitale-Gerenge had three time extensions but had not been completed after the third.
- For Rukungiri Kihihi Ishasha/Kanungu, there was a progress lag of 14% at the time of audit
- For the Kampala Northern Bypass, the project that was initially intended to last 3 years ended up being implemented in 7.5 years.











The Accounting Officer attributed the delays in implementation due land acquisition delays, adverse weather conditions, increases in scope, inadequate mobilization of personnel and equipment by contractors among others.

I advised the Accounting Officer to verify the capacity of contractors to execute the works and ensure accessibility of sites for timely implementation of the projects. Any delays should also be penalized with liquidated damages.

2.4.5 Delayed payment of Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs) to the Contractors

I found that payment of interim payment certificates to the contractors were not on time for eight projects under audit. Delays in payments of IPCS lead to interest payments and affect the contractor’s cash flows in project execution. The following delays were noted on the following projects and determinations had been done for some certificates.

- For Kapchorwa - Suam project, delays were noted on all IPCs up to IPC No 7 resulting in an interest payment of UGX.1,077,615,634
- For Tirinyi Pallisa Kumi, IPCs 1 to 6 were delayed resulting in a certified interest of UGX.453,941,270. 31
- Pallisa Kamonkoli, delays were observed on IPCs 1 to 7 resulting in a certified interest of UGX.283,894,831.47
- Mpigi town roads, all payments to the contractor were delayed between 28 and 242 days
- Namunsi Sironko Muyembe Kapchorwa (Phase II), delays were noted on IPCs 5 to 9 with delays ranging from 4 days and over 7 months.
- Kitala Gerenge project, there were delays in payments to suppliers in June 2021
- Rukungiri Kihihi Ishasha/Kanungu, there were delays in payments on IPCs 1-15 with delays ranging from 8 to 142 days.
- For Kampala Northern Bypass, payments were delayed and interest paid in Addendum No.3 for all payments up to June 2020.

The Accounting Officer attributed delays to reductions in MTEF allocations resulting in funding shortages.

I advised the Accounting Officer to have remedies that reduce the magnitude of interest on delayed payments and ensure that payment of all contractors certificates are expedited and paid in time to avoid grounds for potential claims and unnecessary delays in works.

- For Kapchorwa Suam road project, a single unsegregated toilet was being used by female and male workers at Km 61 RHS quarry, poorly maintained vehicles (no reverse or break lights, non-functional indicators, non-working AC etc.), not enforcing PPE for workers, and limited access provisions for communities
- For Kigumba Bulima road project, there was no signage for heavy vehicles turning at the quarry and camp sites, no traffic control persons at quarry access, no speed calming measures at quarry and town roads, no temporary latrine provided at Km 4+000LHS borrow pit, fire extinguishers out of service, unfenced borrow pit with deep excavations at Km 4+000LHS, partially fenced quarry and asphalt plant, no valid hazardous licenses for waste storage or transportation, no











licences for petroleum operations for quarry and asphalt plants and other mini camps with oil operations, and no NEMA permit for the quarry at Ntooma.

- For Tirinyi-Pallisa Kumi road project, some residents were not provided with access points at Km 1+726LHS, Km 4+888RHS, and Km 6+475RHS.
- For Namunsi Sironko Muyembe Kapchorwa, there were no signage, warning signs, speed calming measures and disclaimers to borrow sources and quarries, and no temporary latrines to the active borrow pit at Km 11+000. For active site with stone picthing works, there were no signage and safety ribbons, and some workers had no safety wear.
- For Kitala Gerenge project, some road signage was not reflective, a waterborne system without water and other supplies, and no first aid clinic.
- For Rukungiri Kihihi Ishasha/Kanungu project, there was poor waste management; poor management and storage of used oil, poor mechanical conditions of trucks, lack of adequate PPE’s especially footwear, unrestored borrow pits. The site had un-serviced fire extinguishers, first aid kit and essential drugs, flaggers to guide traffic at active sections, safety officers, lack of signage, resting shade for workers, inadequate sanitary facilities and toiletries, etc. The project also didn’t have a numbers of permits and licenses such as hazardous waste storage license, fuel storage and operation license, work permits for some foreign nationals, etc.

The Accounting Officer indicated that some the inefficiencies had been addressed. Fire extinguishers were now serviced, signage and traffic control measures were provided at locations where they were missing, fence repairs on quarry and asphalt plant areas had been repaired, among others.

I advised the Accounting Officer to consider instituting punitive measures for non- compliance to the environmental, social, health and safety requirements.

2.4.7 Quantity verification

I undertook measurements on some selected items to establish the consistency with which the supervision team accurately measures the quantities before payments. I established an amount of UGX.231,870,478.13 & EUR 47,469.01 from different projects as overpayment as shown in the table following.

Table 6: Overpayments

2.4.8 Unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor

I observed unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor which can lead to overpayments if unaddressed. This was noted on the following projects;

- Kapchorwa Suam project where the foreign currency exchange rates were being applied without justification which might lead to computation errors in price adjustment certificates.
- Tirinyi Pallisa Kumi where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX.3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX.3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of UGX.54,836,464.3
- Pallisa Kamonkoli where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX.3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX.3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of UGX.40,050,883.2

The Accounting Officer indicated that the selling rate would be reviewed and corrected in the final accounts. As for price adjustments, the error in use of current exchange rates for computation would be corrected.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the right rates are adopted for payments to prevent any financial loss.

2.4.9 Adoption of a split currency (USD-UGX) in payments for a Government of Uganda funded contract leading to a loss of approximately UGX.15,448,939,920

I established that, for Mpigi town roads project, the contractor was paid in part foreign currency despite a PSST directive against the practice for solely Government of Uganda funded projects. USD 11,153,986.05 was paid out to the Contractor at an exchange rate of 1USD at UGX 2,282.1, which meant that Government incurred an extra cost of over UGX.15,448,939,920.88 to acquire this amount of dollars considering the average USD exchange rate was UGX.3667.16 during the contract execution period.

The Accounting Officer responded that the procurement was a Direct procurement whose basis of contracting was based on the Terms and Conditions of an old contract of 2013 which been procured competitively. The justification was the continuation of use of the same contractor who was already mobilized in the project area.











referenced did not form any part of the contract documents as listed in the contract agreement.

3.0

Management of Public Land

Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) requires the Accounting Officers to be responsible for the management of the land under their custody. Public land management is the process by which public land resources are put to proper utilization. Paragraph 16.13.11 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that for a Government entity to be considered to have control over land only when it has the title.

The current financial reporting framework requires Land to be recognized as Non- produced assets in the statement of financial position (effective 2014) for all reporting entities on both Modified accrual and accrual basis of Accounting. The framework further requires land procured prior to 2014, and where the value cannot be ascertained to be recorded in the memorandum statement to the financial statements.

I observed that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and Local Governments (LGs) have challenges with regard to planning and budgeting, protecting, reporting, utilization and disposal of Public Land. These challenges include; inadequate record keeping, non-compliance to recognition and measurement criteria, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, and lack of land titles, among others. These have negatively affected the quality of financial statements, and hampered service delivery and fulfilment of entity mandates.

Documents, such as; Laws and Regulations, approved strategic plans, policy statements, budgets, Financial Statements, Asset Register, Court case files and correspondences, Land titles and lease files were reviewed. In additions, I interacted with entity management and discussed issues affecting public land management. Furthermore, I physically inspected some pieces of land owned by the entities.

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following;

3.1	of the approved budget of UGX.1,567.84Bn for land acquisition, UGX.1,292.13Bn was warranted / availed to the entity during the period under review representing 82.4% performance.

3.2.	Registration and titling of land Titling and transfer of land I observed that out of the 2,080 land titles that the entity obtained during the financial years 2018/19 to 2021/22, only 102 land titles had been transferred into UNRA’s name resulting into the balance of 1,978 (95%) land titles that were still in the names of PAPs by the end of the year under review, Appendix II refers.of Land titles may result into encroachment, disputes and loss of public funds through multiple compensation.The Accounting Officer explained that UNRA is currently working with URA to obtain Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) of registered proprietors to facilitate transfer process.Lack	advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the process of obtaining TINs.I	




Emphasis of Matter Without modifying my opinion, I would like to draw the readers’ attention to the following matter(s) which have been disclosed in the financial statements of the Authority:

4.0

Contingent Liabilities – UGX.381,799,539,802

The Statement of Contingent Liabilities shows that the entity had contingent liabilities worth UGX 381,799,539,802. Included in that amount is UGX.144,301,631,989 in- respect of certificates of works that were not yet approved by the Accounting Officer at the close of the financial year, Appendix III refers.

This meant that the Authority will have difficulty in settlement of the contingent liabilities that will crystalize into payables within the agreed contract terms because they will not have been budgeted for in the following financial year. This will result into late payment penalties and increased projects’ costs.

The Accounting Officer explained that the exercise for the verification and approval of works certificates is a very lengthy process because of the technicalities and the amounts involved.











for work done and is provided for in the contract. It was further explained that management of UNRA continues to engage Ministry of finance for additional funding to avoid interest accumulation.

I advise the Accounting Officer to liaise with MOFPED to ensure that funds are made available on time so that certificates are settled within the agreed timelines in the contracts.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer of UNRA is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of UNRA.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Public Finance and Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Authority`s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.











- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls in the Authority.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Authority`s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.











Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

In accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of the Authority with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

6.0

Management of Information Technology (IT) Investments in Government

The Government of Uganda (GOU) is making large investments in Information Technology (IT) systems because of the tremendous benefits that IT can bring to its operations and services. One of the key programmes of NDPIII 2020/21-2024/25 is Digital Transformation, in which Government of Uganda, aims to increase Information, Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use of digital services for enhancing social and economic development.

As a result of national prioritisation of IT, the Auditor General undertook a thematic audit covering three financial years’ expenditure (2019/20 to 2021/22) to scrutinise the management of IT Investments across Government. The overall objective was to assess whether the IT investments in Government are strategically aligned, managed appropriately and focused on achieving the NDP III objective. The procedures undertaken covered: planning and budgeting; procurement, utilization, maintenance and disposal of IT systems; governance, and financial reporting.

For the current year 2021/2022, the entity budgeted for UGX.11,834,109,812 for acquisition and implementation of IT systems and equipment and received UGX.10,832,914,060.

A review of IT activities implemented revealed the following;

	Observations	Recommendations	
6.1	Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014 guides that All organizations must implement appropriate business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) programmes to minimize the impact of and ensure the timely recovery from interruptions that may result from natural disasters, accidents, equipment failures and deliberate actions.However, I noted that the entity did not have a business continuity and disaster recovery plan.a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, the entity was not prepared for potential disruptive events.Accounting Officer explained that UNRA has engaged NITA-U on the MoU to have shared services for business continuity (BC), National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI), software licenses, and the initiative to establish a Disaster Recovery (DR) site in consultation with NITA-U which willWithoutThe	advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the engagement with NITA-U is finalised and a business continuity and disaster recovery plan is put in place.I

7.0 Procurements

7.1

Delayed completion of road projects

The June 2022 road construction status report and contract management files revealed that 22 road projects with a total contract value of UGX.82,177,512,239 that were planned to be completed during the year under review were still on going by the end of the year. The delays increase the costs of delivering the projects, Appendix V refers.

The Accounting Officer explained that the delayed completion of projects was a result of inadequate funds release which resulted in failure to pay contractors for works executed. The consequence was that most of the contractors abandoned site and works failed to progress as planned.

I advised management to liaise with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to ensure that the entity budget is fully availed to pay contractors so that projects are completed within the agreed timelines.

7.2

Abandoned Road Works on Busolwe – Nabumali Junction

On 10 th May, 2021 management of UNRA issued a call-off order at a sum of UGX.1,486,162,399 for mechanised maintenance of Busolwe – Nabumali Junction road (35.1Km). The contract execution period was 6 months from 24 th May, 2021 to 23 rd October, 2021.

However, during the field inspection in November 2022, it was established that Contractor had abandoned the works after the entity failed to pay the invoice for Interim Payment Certificate (IPC)- No 1 worth UGX.529,626,498 (VAT inclusive) dated 09 th November, 2021.

The liability was attracting interest and the users of the road were being inconvenienced.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Contractor abandoned the site due UNRA’s failure to pay for the executed works resulting from inadequate release.
