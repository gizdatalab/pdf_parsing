1,Asphalt Concrete (AC20),"Grading, Passing Sieve (mm)",Average, ,The gradation failed to meet the target requirement together with tolerance,The bitumen content as extracted is high. The mix is likely to bleed. is addition the ITS test fails and this likely to affect the durability of the asphalt layer In
