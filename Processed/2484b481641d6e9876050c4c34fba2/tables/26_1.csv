0,1.0,Unit project item costs as per Engineers Estimates. (5 Marks),Item 1,"5 items that are common to all USMID & Non USMID Municipal works contracts were selected. The unit cost of each of these items was obtained from the Engineers estimates. The lowest unit cost for a particular item across the Municipalities was given the maximum score of 1. The scores (Si) of the other Municipalities for that particular item were computed using the formula; 𝐒𝐢 = 𝟏 𝐱 𝐅𝐦/𝐅, in which Fm is the lowest unit cost for a particular item across the municipalities and F is the unit cost of a particular item for the Municipality under consideration. Each of the items selected was assessed separately across the Municipalities. The average unit cost was used in cases where the unit cost for a particular item varies within the same contract. The total score for this parameter for the municipality was the sum of the scores obtained for all the 5 items selected. In Municipalities where the Engineer’s Estimates for some items were not available, they were not considered, and a conversion factor was applied to the available items."
