0,"So it was a case of missing item(bitumen) rather than splitting. Missing items cannot be regarded as savings. Otherwise, this would easily have turned into an arbitratable dispute which the contractor would have easily won. t is not true that road widths were reduced to manage price escalation as reported by the audit team. The road w i dths recommended in the design review were moslty dictated by available road space. Bitumen was never a deciding factor. in most cases (over 80% of the contract length), the road widths were increased during design review. For example Laroo, which is the longest of the batch at 2.49km, was supposed to be 11.0m total width with only 6m wide carriageway was changed to 14m total constructed with 9m carriageway. Peter Paul Opok and Alex ojera roads were supposed to be 10 and 12.5m total constructed widths respectively and were made 14m at design review. Others were 0.6km of Nyerrere changed from 10m to 14m, Golf course from 13m to 14m, Lasto okech from 10m to 14m, Odida from 10m to 14m, Okwera from 15m to 15m, Tank from 12m to 14m. I Moreover", , , 
1,"Audit Comment The management response is trying to hide the bitumen factor from the description of the Original Item 42.01 in the Contract. The Item, for clarity, states as follows: “42.01 ASPHALT CONCRETE SURFACING ; (a) 50mm, 60/70 penetration bitumen with 20mm maximum aggregate”. Indication in the description of this item is that bitumen is inclusive; and the fact that the Contractor did not raise any reservations at tender, contract negotitation, etc, until it was prompted by the Design Review Consultant; suggests that the Contractor could have been aware that the asphalt concrete which was supposed to be furnish per square meter was inclusive of the specified bitumen. The fact that, after being requested, the Contractor submitted a rate breakdown indicating that the original rate was excluding bitumen is obvious expectation from a contractor. The Auditor also notes misrepresentation of facts in the management response regarding changes in road widths. Data in Table 3-2 of the Design Review Report, Page 24, indicates that the widths of 6 roads out of 13 roads were slightly increased whereas as for 7 out of 14 roads, the widths were reduced, substantially for some; e.g., for Nyerere Rd and Sir Samuel Baker Rd, the widths were reduced from 21m to 14m and from 17m to 14m respectively. Also, parking lanes on 6 roads were eliminated and left on only 1 road. The width of Laroo road was never increased; the paved surface is 9m and overall width is 14m.", , ,
