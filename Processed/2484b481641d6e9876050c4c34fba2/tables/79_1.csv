1,Asphalt Concrete (AC20),"Grading, Passing Sieve (mm)",Average, ,The gradation failed to meet the target requirement together with tolerance,target content The bitumen content of 4.7 in the Job Mix Design is high. The bitumen as extracted is high. The mix is In addition the ITS test fails and this is likely to affect the durability of the asphalt layer. likely to bleed.
