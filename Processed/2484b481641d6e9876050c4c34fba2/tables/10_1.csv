0,"24,130 per square metre. In effect, this change means that a square meter of completed Asphalt Concrete was delivered at UGX 68,970. Therefore, total asphalt quantity of (4,324.3/0.05) = 86,486m 2 , the cost escalation amounts to 24,130*86,486 = UGX 2,086,907,180 which is a possible financial loss for the Revised BoQ  All payments to the consultant were made on time however payment of IPC No.4 to the contractor had been delayed by 12 days at the time of audit on 07 th August 2018.  All expected eleven progress reports were availed to the Auditors.
