0,"programme (a) Assessment of progress of works against time (i) Assessment of physical progress lag basing on initial work The works were to be executed over a period of 12 months from 14 th August 2017 to 14 th August 2018. The original work programme was not accompanied with cash flow and progress projections for the project duration. The progress report for the month of July 2018 indicates that, at 31 st July 2018 when nearly 100% progress should have been attained (expiry due on 14 th August 2018), the actual cumulative progress stood at 74.06%.
