0,"in T Management Response It is true, as noted by Auditors, we called one site meeting for all contract works going on at the same time (small local contracts) to avoid fatigue of meetings seeing their number. This is good management and all matters of concerning the contract were tackled. Audit Comment The contract sum of this perticuar project was UGX 977,861,939. It does not appear a “good management” practice to combine a site meeting for such a project with projects of less than UGX 100 Million. Contractual matters cannot be the same.
