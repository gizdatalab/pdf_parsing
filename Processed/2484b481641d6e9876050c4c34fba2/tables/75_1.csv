1,Asphalt Concrete (AC20),"Grading, Passing Sieve (mm)",Average, ,The gradation failed to meet the target requirement together with tolerance,The target bitumen content of 4.7 in the Job Mix Design is high. The bitumen as extracted passed. content ITS test failed and this is likely to affect the durability of the asphalt layer. The
