Further, without clearly and fully quantified outputs, I could not ascertain the level of achievement of these outputs and whether funds appropriated by Board and released were spent and the intended objectives achieved. No explanations were given to this effect. I Failure",Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7,Unnamed: 8,Unnamed: 9,Unnamed: 10,Unnamed: 11

8,"6.5 Implementation of quantified outputs assessed the implementation of twenty-nine (29) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of thirty-Three (33) activities worth UGX 41.8Bn and noted the following; Three (3) outputs with a total of six (6) activities worth UGX 38.7Bn were fully implemented. The entity implemented all the six (6) activities (100%) within these outputs. Two (2) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities worth UGX 0.126Bn were partially implemented. Of the seven (7) activities, the entity did not fully implement any of the activities. Twenty (20) outputs with a total of twenty (20) activities worth 3Bn were not implemented at all. to Table 6 for summary of extent of implementation and amounts spent I    Refer", , , , , , , , , , ,"I advised the Accounting Officer to comply with the SOPs instituted by both the MoH and ICAO following the re-opening of the Airport operations.
