Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### BACKGROUND

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

The Government of Uganda introduced Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) reforms to increase adequacy in financing decentralised health and education services; improve equity in financing decentralised health and education sector services through the transfer system; and ensure efficiency of LG financing and fiscal management of resources for service delivery.  
The UgIFT program is implemented across all local governments which currently stand at 121 districts and 41 Municipal Councils.

As part of this program, a VFM audit was required to be conducted twice, first for the F/Y 17/18 expenditures (as a baseline) and second for the F/Y 2020/21 expenditures (end term) in health and education sectors in the participating Local Governments.

The objective of this audit was to assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which Local Governments have utilized their investments in the delivery of infrastructure and services in the education and health sectors for the Financial Year (FY) 2017/18.  
During the year 2017/18 (base year for this assessment), the total Local government population was 121 districts and 41 Municipal Councils; out of which a sample of 22 districts and 8 municipalities were selected for this assessment. The sampled Local governments included, Rakai, Mityana, Mayuge, Kagadi, Bukwo, Pader, Lamwo, Rukungiri, Kabale, Ibanda, Mpigi, Masaka, Jinja, Buyende, Lira, Kaabong, Gulu, Hoima, Kiryandongo, Butaleja, Luuka and Napak, Masaka MC, Kamuli MC, Kitgum MC, Masindi MC, Kumi MC, Koboko MC, Kasese MC and Makindye – Ssabagabo MC.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-08_0.png)

The scope of the assessment covered 3 themes comprising of; utilisation of funds, delivery of infrastructure and delivery of services using an assessment tool that was developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders. For this purpose, to the extent feasible, 10 infrastructure projects were selected within the LG. School or health centres in which these projects had been undertaken were subjected to the assessment.  
For this purpose, 5 schools and 4 health facilities were selected. This report presents the results of the baseline VFM evaluation for Gulu district. In this district, the sample of schools and health facilities selected as presented in the Table 1 and Table 2 below:

The assessment was undertaken using a tool developed after wide consultations with key stakeholders. Data per indicator was collected through review of LG documents, interviews and field inspections of the project facilities in the Gulu DLG. Capacity gaps were identified and recommendations suggested for improvement in the delivery of infrastructure and services in the Education and Health sectors in Gulu DLG.  
The assessment was carried out under three themes for both sectors as follows:

- Theme 1 - Funds utilization
- Theme 2 - Delivery of infrastructure
- Theme 3 - Delivery of services

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-09_0.png)

### Classification of satisfactory levels

Note that for a LG to be assessed as satisfactory, It would have scored at least 90% of the marks allocated to the sub objective across the 3 themes being assessed. The lower threshold for fairly satisfactory performance is 60%. Scores below 60% assessed as not satisfactory.  
A limitation to the VFM assessment was majorly poor record keeping in the institutions. Notwithstanding the above limitation, the main objective of the baseline VFM audit/assessment was achieved, that is, to assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which Gulu DLG had utilized their investments in the delivery of infrastructure and services in the education and health sectors during the Financial Year (FY) 2017/18.

# RESULTS AND KEY FINDINGS

In this baseline VFM audit, baseline data per indicator was collected, capacity gaps identified and recommendations suggested for improvement in the delivery of infrastructure and services in Health and education across the local governments.

### Funding of Gulu DLG

Within the scope of the VfMA, two types of funding were considered, namely operational funding, which included UPE and PHC grants for the education and health sectors respectively; and infrastructure funding which included DDEG, PHC Development Grants, LGMSD, PRDP, SFG and others. All school were receiving UPE and all Health centre IV was receiving PHC funds.

# Overall performance of Gulu DLG

The overall average performance of Gulu DLG for the Education sector across the 3 thematic areas was assessed at 49.62% and this was ranked not satisfactory. For health, the overall performance across the 3 thematic areas was assessed at 57.37% which was also ranked not satisfactory.

The overall performance is expounded below and the reasons for the observed performance in each of the thematic areas are broken down and analysed below;

# Overall Performance in the Education Sector

The overall performance in the education sector for Gulu DLG was 49.62% which was Not satisfactory. The results of the assessment of each of the thematic areas are further discussed below.  
The scores in the education sector ranged from 43.32% (Not satisfactory) to 56.19% (Not satisfactory) across the themes. The results of the assessment of each of the thematic areas are further discussed below.

### Theme 1- Utilization of funds

This theme assessed the utilisation and absorption of funds, timeliness in implementation of activities, efficiency in procurement of goods and services and whether equity was observed in allocation of funds. A total UPE grant of UGX 33,320,976 was received by the sampled schools, however Wii Aceng and Acet primary schools did not provide data on funds utilization and absorption while Loyoajanga primary school did not absorb all the funds. There were delays in the implementation of activities beyond the planned timelines in 4 out of the 5 constructed projects. There was also noncompliance with funds allocation guidelines in 3 out of 5 schools where allocation per pupil was below the National standard of 10,000 per pupil. Tegot, Loyoajonga and Acet Primary Schools were allocated funds below the national standard.

### Theme 2 - Delivery of Infrastructure

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

In this theme the assessment was on the unit cost of delivery of the infrastructure against works of similar nature, the level of implementation of the works against the agreed contract approved work programs and outputs, and the usage and quality of the infrastructural works. There was a wide disparity in contractors’ rates and unit cost per square meter of building works for the assessed projects. It should be noted that the detailed engineers’ estimates were not prepared for all the sampled projects in Gulu DLG. 4 of the sampled projects were not completed within the contractual timelines. All the (05) sampled projects had no detailed measurement sheets to accompany the IPCs as required. Despite the appointment of Contract supervision managers, progress reports and site meeting minutes were not prepared for all the projects. Although construction works generally conformed to design drawings and physical specifications in all projects assessed in Gulu DLG, quality control was not being emphasized in various projects implemented, as no material tests were being carried out before and during construction. As a consequence minor defects such as surface cracks in floor screed, splash apron and masonry works, peeling of finishes off masonry surfaces and cases of poor finishing of works, grille door off hinges and no handles on manhole covers, were visible in the sampled projects. It was observed that all the facilities constructed were being utilised for the intended purposes, and the ESIA reports and EMP were not available for fulfilment of environmental and impact requirements for the projects in the schools. All schools had no provisions of funds for operation and maintenance in their respective budgets.

### Theme 3 - Delivery of Services

Under this theme, performance was assessed based on the quality of services, the unit costs of delivering services, and availability of vital infrastructure in schools. The assessment of quality of education services involved, the assessment of the level of pupil achievement from services provided in schools, the unit cost of services delivered per pupil and the adequacy of human resource and external oversight in provision of education services. The overall performance in the delivery in the education sector was Not Satisfactory (56.19%). Some of the key factors contributing to this performance are;



- There was low P7 completion rate with all the 5 schools assessed achieving below the average completion rate for 2016/2017 of 61.5%.



- All the 5 schools assessed achieved the desired target of 89% pass rate.

- The pupil attendance rate of majority of schools (4 out of 5 schools) was below 50% and 1 school was between 50% and less than 70% attendance rate.





- All the 5 sampled schools failed to meet the recommended Teacher to Pupil ratio of 1:53.



- All the 5 schools failed to achieve the desired teacher attendance rate of 100%. 2 out of the 5 schools had a teacher attendance rate less than 50%, 2 schools were between 70% to 90%, and 1 school between 90% to less than 100%.



- In terms of school inspection, all the 5 schools were inspected 3 times in the academic year as recommended by the Ministry of Education. It was also observed that 1 school implemented less than 70% of the recommendations made, 2 schools implemented between 70 and 90% of the recommendations and the remaining 2 implemented more than 90% of the recommendations.
- The average cost of teaching per pupil per term in Gulu DLG was UGX 55,916 which was below the average UGX.57,217 across all schools in the country and some schools were below the assessed schools average.

- The average number of classrooms for the given number of students for Gulu DLG was 1:80 compared to 1:88 across all sampled LG schools and the national standard of 1:55. Gulu was above both the National standard and within the average across the sampled LGs. The school with the highest ratio was Acet P/S with 1:126 and the school with lowest number of classrooms for the given number of students was Wii Aceng P/S with a ratio of 1:29.

- The availability of other vital infrastructure like; toilet stance (1:48), pupils per desk ratio (4:1) were found to be far below the national standards. On permanent accommodation for at least four teachers, all the schools assessed had permanent accommodation for the teachers.



# Overall Performance in the Health Sector

The overall performance in the Health sector for Gulu DLG was 41.28% which was a not satisfactory. The results of the assessment of each of the thematic areas are further discussed below.

The scores in the Health sector ranged from 28.00% (Not satisfactory) to 57.12% (Not satisfactory) across the themes. The performance was assessed under 3 themes;

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-12_0.png)

### Theme 1: Utilisation of funds

All the funds received by the health centres was utilised and absorbed as intended. However, there were absence of financial records in Binya HCII and Pugwinyi HCII and the utilisation of funds could not be assessed. Most of the sampled projects had no time overruns and the procurement processes were adhered to, apart from the 3 health centres IIs where financial records were not availed. On equity in allocation of funds in the health sector, there was low proportion of health centre budget against the district budget, for instance Oitino HC II and Pugwinyi HC II had a budget allocation of 9% and 16% respectively on the District health sector Budget.

### Theme 2 - Delivery of infrastructure

All the sampled projects were completed within the contractual timelines, However, there was a wide disparity in contractors’ rates and unit cost per square meter of building works for the assessed projects. It should be noted that the detailed engineers’ estimates were not prepared for all the sampled projects.. All the (05) sampled projects had no detailed measurement sheets to accompany the IPCs as required. There were weaknesses in supervision as demonstrated by failure to prepare progress reports and to hold site meetings and contract managers were not appointed to supervise the works executed for all the projects assessed.

Although construction works generally conformed to design drawings and physical specifications in all projects assessed in Gulu DLG, quality control was not being emphasized in various projects implemented, as no material tests were being carried out before and during construction. As a consequence minor defects such as surface cracks in floor screed, splash apron and masonry works, peeling of finishes off masonry surfaces and cases of poor finishing of works, were visible in the sampled projects. It was observed that all the facilities constructed were being utilised for the intended purposes, however, ESIA reports and EMP were unavailable for fulfilment of environmental and impact requirements. All the assessed Health centres had no provisions of funds for operation and maintenance in their respective budgets.

### Theme 3- Delivery of Services

The performance in the delivery of services in the Health Sector was assessed based on; the quality of health services; the usability and functionality of health facilities; and the availability of vital health infrastructure.

The overall performance in the delivery of services in the Health Sector was fairly satisfactory (79.58%) with sub objective assessments ranging from 40.00% (not satisfactory) to 100% (satisfactory). Some of key factors contributing to this performance are;

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-13_0.png)

- Awach health Centre IV did not register maternal deaths in the year of audit and registered 6 stillbirths, other health centres assessed were not admitting in-patients.



- Whereas the average length of stay across all the assessed health units in the country was 1.7 days, Awach HC IV registered an average length of stay (ALOS) 3 days, while the other three HC IIs were not assessed, because they were not mandated to handle admissions.

- Stock outs of Essential Medicines and health Supplies was observed in all health facilities and for instance Awach HC IV experienced 66% Stock out of medical supplies and essential drugs.



- The staffing levels at the health centres were above the target of at least 65% of the core technical staff.



- Assessment of the usability and functionality of health facilities revealed that the bed occupancy rate was 12% and admissions per 100 persons in the population was 19 per 100 at Awach HC IV. Other health centres assessed were HC IIs which do not admit in- patients.



- Assessment of the utilisation of the equipment revealed that all the sampled health centres had 100% of the equipment being functional and utilised except Awach HC1V which lacked a Mortuary.





- All the health units assessed had adequate staff houses: Oitino HC II houses 4staffs, Binya Health Centre II 4, Pugwinyi Health Centre II Patiko 5 and Awach HC IV 25

# Recommendations

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

The baseline VFM audit has established the pre-existing condition of the utilisation of funds, delivery of infrastructure and level of service delivery in the health and education sectors and recommended areas of improvement to ensure improved service delivery in the LG. These recommendations are categorised per theme;

###### Utilization of Funds



- The District authorities should train head teachers in financial and proper records management.
- The District should improve on its supervision and project management to achieve set targets.
- The authorities of Awach H/CIV and Oitino HC II should adhere to financial management guidelines and prepare realistic budgets and absorb funds for better health service delivery.
- The LG should ensure that equity is observed in funds allocation both for the Education and Health sectors.

###### Delivery of Infrastructure



- The User Department with support from the office of the District Engineer must ensure that detailed priced Bills of Quantities are prepared for all planned infrastructure developments on the basis of which the Engineer’s Estimates are determined. This will enable the District to allocate adequate budgets for infrastructure developments. The priced Bills of Quantities and the Engineers Estimates should be properly kept on the Procurement Files.
- Measurement sheets should, at all times, be prepared and attached to the Payment Certificates for all implemented projects as a confirmation that value of the works claimed by the Contractor corresponds to the actual work executed on the ground.
- The LG should ensure that, for effective supervision, site meetings are held regularly at least once a month and the matters discussed should be properly recorded. Furthermore, Contract Management Files should be properly maintained where copies of progress reports, detailed measurement sheets, payment certificates and minutes of site meetings are kept for easy reference.
- Any defects should be promptly attended to by the contractor if they occur during the defect liability period and by the LG if they occur thereafter. Effective supervision and monitoring should be carried out throughout project implementation to minimize incidences that may lead to development of defects.
- The DLG should always ensure that construction materials used are tested and checked for compliance to minimum quality standards. For low value works, simple on site materials tests should be carried out by the Works Supervisor together with the contactor to minimize misinterpretation of results. For large projects, materials tests should be carried out at certified Materials Laboratories.

### Delivery of Services



- The District together with the respective School Management Committees should prioritise repairs and maintenance activities to ensure long term sustainability of the infrastructure. The annual work plans and budgets for the schools should have a budget line for repairs and maintenance of infrastructure projects.

- The CAO and DEO should institute measures to ensure 100% attendance by all teachers in schools.
- The CAO should ensure that the school inspectors carry out inspections in all the Schools regularly at least three times per academic year.
- The CAO and DEO should ensure that all recommendations made by inspectors of schools are fully implemented.
- There is need for expansion of school infrastructure at primary school level especially classrooms, pit latrines, desks and teachers’ houses.
- The Ministry of Health should work closely with National Medical stores to ensure regular supplies of essential medicines to health units.
- The District Health Officer should ensure that the quarterly integrated supervision is conducted at all health units.
- The CAO should work closely with Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development to ensure that funds are availed to construct a Mortuary at Awach HCIV.

### CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

**1.0**

### Background to the VfM Audit/Assessment

The Government of Uganda has been implementing reforms to finance LGs to enable them deliver better mandated services. Among these is the Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) Reform that started in FY 2014/15. The reforms to the LG transfers are implemented by the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MFPED) in collaboration and with positive engagement from the Local Government Finance Commission (LGFC), Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and National Planning Authority (NPA) as well as line Ministries and Local Governments.

The UgIFT Reform Program focuses on three main objectives 1 , namely:  
i.  
Adequacy in financing decentralised health and education services;  
ii.  
Restoration of equity in financing decentralised health and education sector services through the transfer system; and,  
iii.  
Improving fiscal management in Local Governments (LGs) to manage an increase in resources.

Within the intergovernmental fiscal transfer reform process, the LG Performance Assessment (LGPA) system aims at attaining the third objective of the reform – i.e. using the fiscal transfer system to provide incentives for improved institutional and service delivery performance of LGs. The overall objective of the LGPA system is to promote effective behaviour, systems and procedures in order to improve LG’s administration and service delivery.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-16_0.png)

The system has three dimensions: (1) Budget (1a) and accountability requirements (1b); (2) cross-cutting and sector functional processes and systems broken down in measures for districts and LG (2a) and for sub-counties, town councils and divisions (2b); and (3) service delivery results. The first phase of the introduction of the LGPA system focuses on dimensions 1a, 1b, and 2a while work on the other dimensions is in progress.

As part of the LGPA, it was critical to ascertain whether the activities implemented by LGs are efficient, cost-effective and with strong systems and procedures for accountability. However, the LGPA is, at this stage, focusing mostly on systems and procedures of importance for the effective service delivery, hence the need to supplement it with a Value for Money (VFM) Audit function.

As part of the new program, a VFM Audit will be conducted twice – first as a baseline during 2018/19 focusing on FY 2017/18 expenditures; and second during 2022 focusing on FY 2020/21 expenditures in the health and education sectors. The VFM audit will be conducted in line with key results areas of the Program.

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

According to the UgIFT Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLI) 3.1, “A value-for-money audit of LG services and investments in health and education takes place in the first and last year of the operation, which will provide information on the efficiency of sector expenditures.” This is in line with Result Area 3 of the Program: Performance Assessment and Targeted Performance Improvement of the fiscal management of resources for health and education service delivery by Local Governments.  
The baseline VFM audit was conducted to establish the pre-existing condition of the health and education sectors assessed value for money of expenditures incurred by local governments during the financial year 2017/18 and recommend areas for improvement in the implementation of the Program.

### 1.1. Motivation

The motivation for the assignment is to establish the situation obtaining in the HLG prior to the implementation of the Uganda (UgIFT) program. This will then form basis for measuring implementation progress and the effectiveness of the outputs of the expected investments to be implemented in the HLGs using the funds made available to the HLGs.

### 1.2. Objectives of the Audit/Assessment

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-17_0.png)

The overall objective of the audit is to assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which Local Governments utilised their investments in the delivery of infrastructure and services in the education and health sectors during the Financial Year (FY) 2017/18.  
The specific objectives of the assignment were three-fold and centred on three themes, each with its own sub-objectives, as follows: (1) Funds Utilisation; (2) Delivery of Infrastructure; and (3) Delivery of Services in the education and health sectors of the target higher local governments.

### 1.2.1. Funds Utilization

A single sub-objective was prescribed for assessment under theme 1 as follows:  
i.  
To assess efficiency, effectiveness and equity in the utilisation of funds received by the education and health institutions.

### 1.2.2. Delivery of infrastructure

Three sub-objectives were prescribed for assessment under theme 2 as follows:

### i.

Economy, that is, to assess the unit cost of delivery of the infrastructure against works of similar nature;  
**ii.** Efficiency, that is, to assess the level of implementation of the works against the agreed contract approved work programs and outputs; and  
**iii.** Effectiveness, that is, to assess the quality and functionality of the infrastructural works.

### 1.2.3. Delivery of Services

Four sub-objectives were prescribed for assessment under theme 3 as follows:  
**i.** Economy, that is, to evaluate the Unit costs of delivering education and health services;  
**ii.** Efficiency, that is, to assess the quality of education and health services;  
**iii.** Effectiveness, that is, assess the availability of vital infrastructure in the education and health institutions necessary for effective delivery of services; and  
**iv.** Equity, that is, to assess whether equity is observed in funds allocated per school and health facility.

### 1.3. Scope of the VfM Audit/Assessment

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

This section presents the geographical and technical scope as described as indicated below.

### 1.3.1. Geographical Scope

Overall, the VfM Audit/assessment was conducted in 30 LGs sampled out of the 162 LGs (121 LGs and 41 MLGs) across the entire country. The full list of LGs sampled is provided in 0 Therefore, Gulu DLG (Higher Local Government) was part of the 30 LGs assessment (22 Districts LGs and 8 Municipal LGs). Projects implemented at Lower Local Government (LLGs)/Sub Counties/Divisions projects were also assessed.

### 1.3.2. Technical Scope

The VfM audit / assessment covered the sectors in the assessed LGs, which the Government’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers Reform Program focuses, namely health and education. The main objectives of the UgIFT are to ensure:

i.  
Adequacy in financing of decentralised health and education services;  
ii.  
Restoration of equity in financing of decentralised health and education sector services through the transfer system; and,  
iii.  
Improving fiscal management in LGs to manage an increase in resources.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-18_0.png)

The baseline VFM audit was conducted to establish the pre-existing condition of the health and education sectors in the LGs before the implementation of the Program. It assessed value for money of expenditures incurred by LGs during the FY 2017/18 and recommended areas for improvement in the implementation of the Program. The baseline has therefore generated baseline indicator values that reflect the current situation against which program performance targets and impact will be measured over time.

The key aspects considered in the VfMA are; economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity which fall under each of the three main specific audit objectives–i.e. (i) funds utilisation, (ii) delivery of infrastructure and (iii) delivery of services.

### CHAPTER 3: APPROACH & METHODOLOGY

**3.1**

### Audit Standards & Guidelines

The Terms of Reference (ToR) required that the audit be carried out in line with the Performance Auditing Standards and Performance Auditing Guidelines of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) prescribed in the Value for Money Audit Manual published by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG). The ToR also required that a VfM Assessment Tool, included as appendices to the same ToR, be used to evaluate the economy, efficiency and effectiveness in pursuance of the stated Specific Audit Objectives.

**3.2**

### Sampling of Higher Local Governments

The ToR, further prescribed the specific District Local Governments (DLGs) and Municipal Councils (MCs) that comprise the sample districts through a process that included (1) Definition and stratification of the Audit Population into 4 regions, namely Western, Central, Eastern and Northern Regions; (2) Separation of the resultant stratified populations into two populations representative of DLGs and MCs using stratified cluster sampling; (3) Determination of the sample size for each type of HLG as 30 DLGs allocated proportionally among the four regions based on the number of districts per region, and 2 randomly selected MCs.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-21_0.png)

The process described above, resulted in the selection of Gulu DLG as one of the LGs in the Central Region which was audited and assessed.

**3.3**

### Sampling of Facilities at the HLG Level

The focus of the audit / assessment was on the education and health sectors. For each of these, the FY under audit is 2017/2018. The assessment was done for projects implemented in FY 2017/18 and in the event that eligible infrastructure projects were inadequate in the frame, the period was extended to include FY 2016/17and FY 2015/16.

### 3.3.1 Sample size and selection of facilities at the LG level

Selection of education and health facilities within Gulu DLG was determined at the District by examining the contracts registers and workplans of the LG for FY 2017/18, FY 2016/17 and FY 2015/16. Facilities which had infrastructure development in the three years formed the sampling frame (List-frame).

The VfMA selected a sample of 5 schools and 5 health facilities for assessment in the UGIFT program audit as follows:

**i.** Using interviews and documents obtained from the heads of the education and Health departments at the LG, the following were ascertained:

- Total Number of schools where any form of construction had been undertaken, (Latrines, classroom block, teachers house, water tank or any other); and,
- Total number of health facilities where any form of construction had been undertaken, (Latrines, ward block, staff house, water tank or any other).



**ii.** Where 5 or fewer facilities had infrastructure development under education and health, all facilities were selected with certainty under each sector.

### iii.

In case the number was more than 5 schools and/or 5 health facilities where construction was undertaken per LG, the complete list of the school’s/health facilities

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

was entered into an MS-Excel 2013 spreadsheet with the total expenditure for the construction undertaken per facility. The dataset was sorted in descending order based on total expenditure. Using a random start, a systematic sample of 5 schools/5 health facilities was selected for the VfMA.

A total representative random sample of 10 projects (5 in education sector and 5 in Health sector) as listed below was selected using a random number table for the VfMA. The details of the sampled projects are presented in 0

The five (5) projects sampled under the education sector were:

| No. | **Procurement Ref. No.** || **Project Title** |

### 3.4 Data Collection

Data was collected using the following techniques:

###### i. Entry Meetings at the LG

On arrival at the LG, the VfMA team reported to the office of the accounting officer to introduce themselves and to brief him/her about the VfMA exercise, draw up a draft agenda, request him to mobilize HoDs, Sections heads and members of TPC for the entry meeting. Subsequently, an entry meeting was conducted within which the VfMA Team leader informed district officials of the purpose of the VfMA 2019, its implications on the LG for improved service delivery in health and education sectors. The Team Leader also requested district officials to be physically present and provide key documents because the VfMA exercise was evidence-based. Appendix 1 shows the list of participants in the entry meetings.

###### ii. Document Review

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Immediately after the entry meeting, a desk-based review of key documents was conducted by the VfMA team in order to generate background information, extract data for addressing some indicators in the VfMA logframe, extract authentic evidence on file e.g. endorsed (signed and stamped) certificates, payment vouchers, progress reports, school inspection reports, among others indicated in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4.

###### iii. Key Informant Interviews

Key informant interviews were conducted at District headquarter, school and health facility levels to inquire into specific details. Key informants were people who were knowledgeable, experienced and were directly involved in service delivery and implementation of the infrastructure projects. The stakeholders were also asked to clarify on the key observations and emerging issues identified by the VfMA team before, during and after the site visits.

###### iv.

**Physical Inspections of infrastructure projects at LGs**  
The VfMA team conducted visits to the 10 project sites to ascertain the existence, status, functionality and sustainability of structures and other project outputs. In addition, the VfMA team also undertook minimum tests and physical measurements of the quantities of some of the constructed works and these were compared to the quantities certified for payment in the payment certificates.

###### v. Exit Meetings at LGs.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-23_0.png)

Specifically, at the very end of the VfMA exercise in the LG, an exit meeting was conducted in which the VfMA team presented the present general findings specifically the emerging issues, gaps and key recommendations/improvement points but not the actual scores and also seek clarifications from the LG officials (Accounting Officer, HoDs, Section Heads and TPC members). The participants were also given an opportunity to respond to the presentation.

An exit declaration form was used to capture the key emerging issues from the VfMA, level of preparedness (availability of key staff) of the LG, strength and weaknesses identified by the VfMA, and key recommendation. The exit form was endorsed by the Accounting Officer or their authorized representatives and the VfMA Team Leader indicating the agreed position between the VfMA team and the LG officials and each LG party retained a copy for records.

Attendance lists were signed by all participants (0). The clarifications made by the district officials during the exit meetings were used to fill any pending gaps, edit and refine the specific datasheets and narrative reports per thematic area and sector which were submitted to the VfMA Secretariat at PSL.

###### vi. Stakeholder Validation Workshop

This dissemination workshop was organized by OAG in which the VfMA team together with OAG project team presented results from the VfMA 2019 (Synthesis report) to the key stakeholders from the central government (MDAs), development partners, and local governments.

### 3.5 Data analysis and synthesis of information

Data were entered in MS-Excel 2013 spreadsheet. Other information was also typed in MS-Word 2013. Data were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. For example, data were analysed quantitatively using summary statistics (absolute number, means, percentages and totals) generated in MS-Excel 2013. The qualitative data obtained from document review and key informant interviews/consultative discussions were analysed qualitatively using thematic, content and discourse analysis techniques.

***Classification of satisfactory levels;***

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

*Note that for a LG to be assessed as satisfactory, it should have scored at least 90% of the marks allocated to the sub objective across the 3 themes being assessed. The lower threshold for fairly satisfactory (FS) performance is 60%. Below 60% was not satisfactory (NS) performance.*

### 3.6 Quality assurance and reporting

- Prior to fieldwork, a number of inception meetings were conducted between the VfMA and OAG team in Kampala to refine the approach, methods and data collection tools and workplan.
- The pilot exercise was conducted in Mpigi District during which the tools were pretested prior to field work.
- A team of 4 VfMA experts including a Team leader (in Table 1 above) were oriented at deployed to the LG. Besides other coordination roles, the team leader reviewed the progress of each team member on a daily basis and reported to the PSL secretariat.
- In addition, a team of experts from OAG made field visits to the LG as part of monitoring and supervisory role to ensure quality of VfMA exercise.
- A secretariat was formed at the PSL to review the LG specific sector and thematic area reports and to provide technical and administrative guidance to the teams in the field and to report progress made to the VfMA focal person at OAG. The OAG team also attended entry meeting, exist meeting, conducted visits to infrastructure projects sites visits and discussed with LG & facility (health & School) staff and the committee members (SMC& HUMCs) and beneficiary communities.

**3.7**

### Limitations and solutions to the VfMA i.

Access and retrieval of documents at facility level. Due to the poor documentations and filing system used at the facility level especially some primary schools in Gulu DLG, it would take long to access documents, for example, evidence on actions undertaken on the recommendations from the school’s inspection reports.

### ii.

It was difficult to carry out destructive tests such as extract samples especially a bricks, from the completed structures to do audit tests because the cost of repairing the damaged part was not incorporated into the budget for the audit exercise and coupled with time limitations. However, the minimum tests were conducted on roofing, wall and floor, doors and window materials by the Engineers. The VfMA team also undertook minimum tests and physical measurements of the quantities of some of the constructed works and these were compared to the quantities certified for payment in the payment certificates.

Only Tegot PS scored all the available 30 marks earmarked for the sub objective by utilising all the received funds as intended i.e. UPE funds were utilised on Instructional materials, Administration costs, Management, Co- curricular and contingency expenses. Loyoajonga PS and KitenyOwalo PS performed fairly well and scored 15 and 8 marks respectively while Wii-Aceng and Acet primary schools failed both indicators and scored zero out of the available 30 marks. This was because the school administration did not avail financial records (bank statements, payment vouchers and cash books) to the team to verify the utilization and eligibility of funds.

### Recommendation

The District authorities should train head teachers in financial and proper records management.

Out of the 5 sampled projects, only two projects were completed within the planned time i.e. construction of pit latrine at Tegot and Acet primary schools scoring all the 10 marks earmarked for the sub objective. The construction of a four-unit staff house at Wii- Aceng was delayed for 74 days resulting into 82% time overruns. The contract start date was 15/12/2015 and expected end date was 30/3/2016 but actual completion date was 14/6/2016. The construction of one block class room at KitenyOwalo primary school started on 15/12/2015 and expected end date was 30/3/2016, however the project profile file, payment vouchers, Engineers certificate and contract registers were not availed to the VFM audit team to compute the time overruns. Completion of a 2 staff house at Loyoajonga PS was not assessed, the project was sampled but implemented by an NGO which was out of scope and therefore had no procurement records.

### (c) Efficiency in Procurement of Goods and Services Sub Objective 1.3

To assess efficiency in procurement of goods and services (both infrastructure and non-infrastructure)  
To assess efficiency in procurement of goods and services (both infrastructure and non-infrastructure) was measured using six criteria which involved:

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-28_0.png)

- Timeliness of procurements (time taken against procurement plan);
- Percentage compliance to procurement procedures;
- Comparison of contract price with the budget;
- Cost overrun (variation between agreed/contracted cost and actual cost; and,
- Comparison of Actual Unit Cost Across Local Governments.

Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG in ensuring efficiency in procurement of goods and services (both infrastructure and non-infrastructure) was fairly satisfactory (60.6%). The details of the performance of the sampled schools are as shown in Table 9 and Table 10 below:

### Indicator 1.3.1

Timeliness of procurements (time taken against procurement plan)  
Apart from construction of a 2 stance VIP latrine at Tegot PS and construction of a 3 stance drainable latrine at Acet PS which were completed within the time frame ad scored all the available 5 marks, the remaining 3 projects scored zero out of 5 marks because construction of a classroom block at Kitenyi Owalo and construction of a 4 unit staff house at Wii Acheng PS had no project profile files to confirm the time taken and construction of a classroom block at Loyoajonga PS was not implemented.

### Indicator 1.3.2

Percentage compliance to Procurement procedures:  
The Gulu DLG performed very well in the indicator scoring all the available 5 marks except for construction of a classroom block at Loyoajonga PS which was not implemented.

### Indicator 1.3.3

Comparison of contract price with the budget  
Apart from the construction of a 4-unit staff house at Wii Aceng PS, construction of a 3 stance drainable latrine at Acet PS and construction of a classroom block at Kiteny Owalo which attained the maximum score of 5 marks, construction of a 2 stance VIP latrine at Tegot PS had a 4.8% difference and scored 4 out of 5 marks. Construction of a classroom block at Loyoajonga PS was not implemented and therefore scored zero out of 5 marks.

### Indicator 1.3.4

Cost overruns (variation between agreed/contracted cost and actual cost:  
Out of all the sampled 5 projects, there were only two projects at Tegot and Wii-Aceng that did not have cost variations scoring all the available 5 marks. The construction of a 3 stance latrine at Acet primary school had cost variation of Shs. 1,638,662 giving 9% cost variation and scored 4 out of 5 marks, construction of a classroom block at KitenyOwalo primary school had cost variation of Shs. 13,082,438 giving 22% cost variation with a 3 out of 5 marks, whereas there were no contract details for the construction of two class room block at Loyoajonga primary school resulting to a zero score.

### Indicator 1.3.5

Comparison of Actual Unit cost across Local Governments:  
Gulu DLG had three technologies i.e. classrooms, staff house and lined pit latrines which were cross referenced across the 30 LGs sampled. 2 projects were lined pit latrines, One staff house and 1 classroom project.

The assessment revealed that the unit cost of constructing a stance of a lined pit latrine in Gulu DLG among the 5 sample projects were UGX6,571,000 for Tegot P/S project) and UGX5,920,330 (Acet PS project) against minimum cost of shs1,683,860 (Kitegwa PS

- Kagadi DLG) and the Maximum cost of 7,577,252 (St Gyavira Lweza P/S-Makindye Ssabagabo MLG). All the for project had their unit cost per stance above the average of the sampled LG of Shs4,319,290.

The unit cost of constructing a classroom in Gulu DLG was UGX30,380,854 (Kitenyi Owallo P/S Project) minimum cost of Shs22,232,000 (Brim P/S-Bukwo DLG) and the Maximum cost of Shs40,474,743 (Labworomor PS Pader DLG).

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Awach HC IV utilised all the funds (43,541,264) allocated as intended and scored all the available 20 marks, however, Oitino HC II utilised only Shs 3,11,531 out of 5,043,318 received giving a 61% utilisation rate and 1,931,787 was unutilised resulting into 38% scoring 0 out of the 30 points available and Binya HC II and Pugwinyi HC II were sampled and visited but the In charges were reported not at the station attending a training at the District and therefore financial related information was not availed to the team for verification and resulting into a zero score out of the 30 marks earmarked for the indicator.

### Recommendation

AwachH/CIV and Oitino HC II authorities should adhere to financial management guidelines and prepare realistic budgets and absorb funds for better health service delivery. The In-charges of Binya and Pugwiny health centre IIs should be compelled to produce PHC accountabilities for FY 2107/2018, otherwise the risk of mismanagement of funds cannot be ruled out.

### (b) Timeliness in Implementation of Activities

**Sub objective 1.2:** To evaluate timeliness in implementation of activities  
Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG was not satisfactory (40%), the LG scored 8 out 20 marks (as indicated in Table 16 below:

### Indictor 1.2.1

Time overruns (Completion time of an activity vs planned time of completion):  
Only 2 out of the 5 projects sampled indicated that works started and ended on time while the remaining three failed the indicator scoring zero marks as evidenced by the details below:

- GULU508/2106-2107/0000/28 (Construction of a 4 stance Pit Latrine with urinal at Binya Health Centre II, the district procurement and disposal unit did not avail contract register, project profile files, payment vouchers and Engineer's certificates for verification, thus it was not possible to determine the time overruns. The project scored 0 marks

- Renovation of a theatre at Awach HCIV was started in 2104/2015 and dragged on up to 2017/2018 when it was completed. There was no explanation given about the delay. On verification of the contract profile files at the District, it was discovered that the project procurement reference number GULU/508/207- 2018/00017 for the construction of a two stance VIP/drainable Pit latrine at Awach HCIV was also used to award another contract to the same contractor i.e. GULU/508/207- 2018/00017 Construction of a two stance pit latrine at Oguru Market in Awach sub county worth Shs. 8,490,436 under DDEG.

The following documents that were attached to the contract file for the construction of a two stance VIP Pit latrine at Awach HC IV related to the construction of the Pit Latrine at Oguru Market in Pukony parish Awach sub county: (a) Best evaluated bidder notice dated 16/4/2018, LGPP FORM 1 dated 19/9/2017, Bid notice / advert under restricted National bidding, bid acceptance letter dated 2/5/2018, Letter of acceptance dated 30/4/2018.

In conclusion, the bid documents as shown above all related to the second project that was not sampled and was not in the Health Sector. There seem to be procurement flaw where the contractor GORENG (U) LIMITED was awarded contract to construct a VIP Latrine at Awach Health centre IV without following the right procurement procedures as recommended by PPDA Act 2016. The only procurement document on file was the contract agreement signed 3/5/2018.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-37_0.png)

**GULU508/2017-2018/00021** (Construction of one block of two stances VIP latrine with urinal at Pugweny HC II in Patiko sub county under DDEG by **North tech Engineering and Construction (U) Limited.** The project was completed in time, however the following un ethical and procurement flaws were discovered while verifying the related documents:

(a) The letter of Bid acceptance signed by the contractor Mr. Abur Nancy Atare was dated 4/5/2018 after signing the contract agreement on 3/5/2018 implying that the contract agreement was signed earlier than the contractor accepted the bid offer which is contrary to the PPDA regulations.

(b) Best evaluated bidder Notice dated 16/4/2018 had two letters each bearing a different contract price; one letter contained Shs. 7,410,400 and another Shs. 9,641,458 both letters were attached to the contract agreement and both signed by Mr. Opolot Philip Gonzaga.

(c) Ranking of bidders were also evaluated and assessed by the team, it was discovered that 2 companies were ranked as follows:  
(i) Lacam (U) Limited was ranked number 1 with contract price of Shs. 7,410,40  
(ii) North tech Engineering and Construction (u) Limited was ranked number 2 with contract price of Shs. 7,584,000. However, the Contract Committee meeting sitting on 16/4/2018 under minute number GULU508/CC/2017-2018/04 decided to award the contract to North tech Engineering and Construction (U) Limited using the contract price of Lacam (U) Limited of Shs. 7,410,400, this is contrary to the PPDA regulations and does not rule out procurement flaws in this particular contract.

### Recommendation

Gulu DLG procurement and disposal unit should ensure that all procurements in the district comply with the stated regulations in the PPDA Act

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

### Indicator 1.3.1

Timeliness of procurements (time taken against procurement plan)  
Construction of a 4 stance VIP latrine with a shower at Awach HC IV was completed within the planned time i.e. 58 days against 112 days in the procurement plan and passed the indicator scoring all the available 5 marks. However, the remaining 4 sampled projects failed the indicator because, completion of a theatre at Awach HCIV took 4 years from 2014/2015-2017/2018, the delay was not substantially explained to the VFM audit team.

For the other 3 projects at Pugwinyi, Binya and Oitino HCs, the contract registers, specific contract files payment vouchers and Engineer’s certificates were not availed for verification to determine the timeliness in procurement.

### Indicator 1.3.2

Percentage compliance to Procurement procedures  
Out of the 5 sampled projects, 3 projects did not have their project files to compare with the procurement plan, hence consistence in procurement procedures was not compared. However, all procurement procedures were evaluated and showed in consistency in implementation of activities.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-41_0.png)

The procedures included, preparation and approval of procurement plan, development of TORs and specifications, preparation of bid documents, approval of bid documents by contracts committee, invitation to bid/adverts, issue of bid documents, evaluation of bids, contact award, signing of contract by Chief Executive and contract management and implementation. Therefore, percentage of compliance to procurement procedure was rated at 0%.

### Recommendation

The CAO should strengthen the internal control systems of the District to avoid future procurement flaws.

### Indicator 1.3.3

Comparison of contract price with the budget  
The contract prices of 3 projects were compared with the estimated budgets and gave the following percentage differences: The district budgeted Shs. 13,830,000 for the construction a pit latrine at Awach HCIV and actual contract price was 13,000,000 giving 6% difference and therefore scored 3 out of the available 5 marks. Pugweny HCII budgeted was Shs. 9,000,000 for the construction of a Pit latrine and actual contract price that was awarded for the project was Shs. 7,410,400 giving 18% difference. For the renovation of a theatre at Awach health centre IV the budget was not provided as the project started way back in 2014/2015 and was completed in 2017/2018. The budgets for projects at Binya HCII and Oitino health centre II were not availed to the team as contract files relating these projects were not also availed for assessment and therefore scored zero out of the available 5 marks.

### Indicator 1.3.4

Cost overruns (variation between agreed/contracted cost and actual cost  
The agreed contract price for the construction of 2 stance VIP pit latrine at Pugweny HCII and Awach HC IV were maintained each giving 0% cost overrun and scored all the available 5 marks. The renovation of a theatre at Awach HCIV had cost overrun of 18% scoring 3 out the 5 marks and the remaining 2 projects at Binya and Oitino HCs had no contract files to determine cost overruns scoring 0 out of the 5 available marks.

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program

### Recommendation

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

The CAO should devise a way of improving the records keeping system in the Procurement and Disposing unit of the district.

### Indicator 1.3.5

Comparison of Actual Unit cost across Local Governments. (5 marks)  
Gulu DLG had three technologies i.e. Placenta pit, Theatre and lined pit latrines which were cross referenced across the 30 LGs sampled. 2 projects were lined pit latrines at HC II, One lined pit latrines at HC IV, 2 placenta pits and 1 project at the theatre.

The assessment revealed that the unit cost of constructing a stance of a lined pit latrine at health centre II level in Gulu DLG were UGX3,705,000 for Pugwiny HC II against minimum cost of UGX2,059,150 (Lawire HC II Pader DLG and the Maximum cost of UGX5,727,812 (Namulo HCII –Butaleja DLG). The project at Binya and Oitino Health centres were not cross referenced due to lack of data.

Also the unit cost of constructing a placenta pit against minimum cost of UGX194,878 (Kampiringisa HC II Mpigi DLG) and the Maximum cost of 264,374 (Oitino HC II – Gulu DLG).

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-42_0.png)

This assessment revealed that there were wide differences in the unit cost per output of similar projects between Local Government and within the Local Governments as shown in the table 38(b).

### Indicator 1.3.6

Delivery of the purchased items from the district to the health unit  
Delivery of the purchased items from the district to the health unit since in all the 5 projects sampled, there were no items that were seen by the VfMA team, as evidence, not to have been despatched to the health facility from the District LG.

### (d) Equity in Funds Allocated per Health Facility

Sub objective 1.4  
To assess whether equity is observed in funds allocated per health centre:  
Overall performance of Gulu DLG was not a satisfactory performance scored 57.12% in ensuring that equity is observed in funds allocated per health as shown in Table 19 .

### Indicator 1.4.1

For each health centre, determine the Proportion of health centre budget on approved District health budget:  
The proportion of health centre budget on the performance was affected because of missing documents from Binya HCII where data to compute proportion of HC budget to the district health budget was not availed to the VFM audit team.

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

The documents reviewed for this assessment included but were not limited to; Procurement Files, Engineer’s Estimates and signed Contracts.

Under this sub-objective Gulu DLG was assessed at 34.50% which was not satisfactory performance mainly due to absence of Engineer’s Estimates and high unit cost of delivery of infrastructure when compared with other LGs. The assessment under each performance indicator is described in the following sections:

### Indicator 1.1.1

Unit project item costs as per Engineer’s Estimates) **(5 marks)**

### Recommendation

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

The User Department with support from the District Engineer’s Office must ensure that detailed priced Bills of Quantities are prepared for all planned infrastructural developments on the basis of which Engineer’s Estimates are determined. The Engineer’s Estimates Guide Council in budgeting and prioritizing infrastructure projects and also provide basis for evaluating bids and award of contracts. The priced Bills of Quantities and the Engineers Estimates should be properly kept on the Procurement Files.

### Indicator 1.1.2

Unit project item costs as per signed Contracts  
A review was made of contractors’ unit item rates for all sampled school projects in the 30 Local Governments sampled for VfM Audit and the lowest unit rates for each of the 5 selected project items was selected. A comparison of unit item rates for schools in Gulu DLG was made against the lowest unit item rates among schools in 30 Local Governments for the same selected items. The item score **(S )** was computed using the **i**  
formula; **S** 2 x F /F,** in which **F** is the lowest unit cost for a particular item across

# i = m m

schools in the 30 Local Governments and **F** is the unit cost of a particular item for schools in Gulu DLG. The results of the assessment are presented in the Table 22 below:

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Under indicator 1.1.2 (Unit project item costs as per signed Contracts), Gulu DLG scored 15.5 out of the total available marks. The findings were that the unit cost of concrete class 25 varied from UGX 373,000/= to UGX 395,000/=; that of brick walling from UGX 30,000/= to UGX 38,000/=; that of roofing iron sheets from UGX 22,000 to UGX 38,000/=; that of roofing timber 100 x 50 mm from UGX 5,500/= to UGX 9,500/=; that of reinforcement bars from UGX 5,600 to UGX 8,500/=. The varying unit item costs could be attributed to pricing strategies by the respective contractors.

### Indicator 1.1.3

Unit cost per square meter of building works among the schools  
A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of building works in all sampled school projects in the 30 Local Governments and the lowest unit cost per square metre was selected. A comparison of the unit cost per square meter of school building works in Gulu DLG was made against the lowest cost per square metre among schools building works in the 30 Local Governments. The unit cost per square meter scores **(S )** is **i** computed using the formula **S 10 x F /F,** in which **F** is the lowest unit cost per

# i = m m

square meter for similar category of infrastructure across all schools the 30 sampled Local Governments and **F** is the unit cost per square meter of a similar infrastructure in Gulu DLG.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-48_0.png)

The score for Gulu DLG derived from cross referencing the unit cost per square meter of building works across the sampled 30 Local Governments was 12.1 out of the total available marks.

### Recommendation

Gulu DLG is urged to use Competitive Bidding methods in the procurement of works to extent practically possible in order to promote competition so as to ensure economy in the delivery of infrastructure.

(b)  
To assess the progress of the works against time  
Progress of works against time was assessed using physical progress lag (difference between the planned as derived from the initial work program and actual physical progress) and physical progress lag (difference between the planned as derived from the current approved revised work program and actual physical progress).

Overall performance of Gulu DLG which was not satisfactory performance scored 30% as shown in Table 23 below:

### Indicator 2.1.1

Physical progress lag – (difference between the planned as derived from initial work program and actual physical progress)  
All the 5 sampled projects failed this indicator because of inadequate information and therefore scored zero out of 5 marks. The procurement plans for all the five sampled projects did not include the initial work program indicating the initial planned commencement and completion dates and therefore it was not possible to calculate the physical progress lag as derived from the initial work plan .

### Recommendation

The Bidding Documents should contain a Clause that requires the bidders to include the work programs in their bids and failure to do that would lead to declaration of the bid non-compliant. The Procurement and Public Disposal Unit must ensure that complete bids submissions are kept on Procurement Files.

### Indicator 2.1.2

Physical progress lag – (difference between the planned as derived from the current approved revised work program and actual physical progress)  
Construction of a 2 stance VIP pit latrine at Tegot PS and construction of a 3 stance drainable pit latrine at Acet PS performed very well and scored all the available 5 marks, while construction of 4-unit staff house at Wii-aceng PS scored 3 out of the available 5 points and construction of a classroom block at Kitenyi Owalo scored 2 point because project completion was delayed by 1.5 and weeks respectively. the project at Loyoajong PS was not assessed because it was implemented by an NGO and was out of scope of this assignment. The possible causes of this delayed completion were either one or all of the following: poor planning, inadequate supervision by the Project Managers, cash flow constraints by Contractors or incompetency of the contractor.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-50_0.png)

### Recommendation

The District should put in place project supervision and monitoring mechanisms to track progress to ensure timely implementation of the infrastructure developments

**Sub objective 2.2**  
To assess the existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works  
The existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works was assessed using Presence of detailed measurement sheets, Payment above certified amounts (IPCs, fee notes, material supply invoices, Percentage of overpayment (as a result of variance between audit values and certified works) to the certified value of the works and Timeliness in payment of IPCs, fee notes, material supply invoices.

Overall performance of Gulu DLG was 60% which was a fairly satisfactory performance as shown in Table 24 below:

### Indicator 2.2.1

Presence of detailed measurement sheets  
All the sampled projects did not have detailed measurement sheets attached to the Payment Certificates resulting into a zero score out of the 2 marks earmarked for the indicator.

### Recommendation

Measurement sheets should be prepared and attached to the Payment Certificates.

### Indicator 2.2.2

Payment above certified amounts (IPCs, fee notes, material supply invoices  
Out of the 5 sampled projects performed very well, scoring all the 2 available marks. However, the financial records for the construction of 2 classrooms block at Kitenyi Awalo Primary School were not available for verification and therefore scored zero marks. The construction of 2 unit Teachers’ House at Loyoajong PS was not assessed because it was out of scope if the assignment.

### Indicator 2.2.3

Percentage of overpayment (as a result of variance between audit values and certified works) to the certified value of the works  
All sampled projects had no overpayments as shown in the table above.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-52_0.png)

### Indicator 2.2.4

Timeliness in payment of IPCs, fee notes, material supply invoices etc.  
All payments were within stipulated timelines of the signed contract of 30 days for all the projects sampled under education sector except for construction of 2 classrooms block at Kitenyi Awalo PS where payment certificates and vouchers were not availed to the VFM Audit team for verification and scored zero out the available 2 marks.

### Recommendation

The Accounting Officer must ensure that financial records are properly kept and readily available for verification.

### (c) To Review contract supervision and monitoring arrangements

Contract supervision and monitoring arrangements were measured using:

- presence of quality progress reports;
- minutes of site meetings; and,
- Approved supervising personnel and approved equipment on site.

Overall the performance of Gulu DLG in contract supervision and monitoring arrangements was not satisfactory scored 33.3% of the total available marks as shown in Table 25 below:

**Quality Progress reports**

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Progress reports were not available for verification for 2 out of the 4 projects. One project for the construction of one block of three-stance drainable latrine at Acet P/S had one progress report which was of poor quality.

**Site meetings**  
There were no minutes of the site meetings for all the projects

### Supervising Personnel

There was evidence in form of appointment letter from the Chief Administration Officer appointing the District Engineer as Contract Manager for construction works in sampled Projects.

### Equipment on Site

At the time of audit inspection, construction works had been completed and as such no equipment was found on site.

### Recommendation

The Accounting Officer should ensure that adequate mechanisms for project implementation supervision and monitoring are in place. Project Supervisors should ensure that regular site meetings are held and minutes of site meetings recorded and should maintain Contract Management Files where among others progress reports and minutes of site meetings are properly kept.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-54_0.png)

### (d) To assess the quality of works under implementation

The quality of works under implementation was measured using:

- presence of material test results;
- conformity of site works to design drawings and physical specifications;
- conformance to of audit tests to specifications; and,
- evidence of defects from visual observations.

Overall performance of Gulu DLG 88.75% which was a fairly satisfactory performance as shown in Table 26 below;

### Presence of material test results on file

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Review of the documents availed for audit showed that there were no material test results on file. In the absence of these, the audit could not ascertain whether the District conducted any material testing on the construction materials that were used. The inability to conduct material testing exposes the District to the possible use of materials that don’t meet specified quality standards thus compromising on the structural integrity of the infrastructure.

### Recommendation

The District must always ensure that where practical, construction materials used are tested at certified Materials Laboratories and checked for compliance with minimum quality standards.

### Conformance of site works to design drawings and physical specifications

Some of the work items were checked by the audit team to ascertain conformance to design drawings and specifications. The results are presented in Table 27 below; It is noted that all items checked conformed to the required specifications.

# Table 27 :

Items checked for conformity

| 5 | Doors | 900 x 2400mm | 900 x 2400mm | Conformed |  


### Conformance of audit test results to specifications

It was difficult to carry out destructive tests such as extracting samples such as bricks and concrete cores from the completed structures to do carry out compressive strength tests because the cost of repairing the damaged part was not incorporated into the budget for the audit exercise and time limitations. However, the minimum tests were conducted on roofing, walls, floor, doors and window materials which revealed that the construction materials used in the construction of 4 units’ staff house at Wii Aceng Primary School, construction of one block of classrooms at Kitenyi Owalo Primary School and construction of a two-stance latrine with a urinal at Tegot Primary School. Whereas the roofing timber sizes used for construction of one block of three-stance drainable latrine at Acet P/S did not conform to specifications.

### Inspection of Works

The visual observations of the sampled projects during inspection revealed that there were no major structural defects as evidenced by the attached photographs.

### (e) To assess the utilization of the infrastructure

Utilisation of infrastructure was assessed by the observed functionality, usage of the facilities and influence of the structure on community’s decision to bring children to the respective schools.

Overall Gulu DLG scored all the available 13 marks earmarked for the sub objective (100%) which was a satisfactory performance as indicated in Table 28 below:

The District performed poorly on the environmental and social impacts safeguards, health and safety requirements and action indicator scoring 0 out of the available 5 marks. All the sampled projects did not adhere to this performance indicator. This is an indication that the LG did not screen and write ESMP for the infrastructural projects.

### Recommendation

The District Environment Officer and the Community Development Officer should carry out environment and social screening of all projects before implementation and ensure that the identified mitigation measures, health and safety requirements are implemented and action reports filed as required.

### (g) To assess the systems of operation and maintenance of infrastructure

The systems of operation and maintenance of infrastructure is assessed by the presence of budget line for repairs and maintenance and presence of funds maintenance and repair as indicated in Table 30 below.

Overall Gulu DLG scored 0 out of 10 marks (0%) which was not a satisfactory performance as indicated in the table below. The LG neither budgeted nor spent funds on O&M and therefore scored 0 out of the available 10 points.

The documents reviewed for this assessment included but were not limited to; Procurement Files, Engineer’s Estimates and signed Contracts.

Under this sub-objective Gulu DLG was assessed at 22.40% which was not satisfactory performance.

The performance was affected mainly due to absence of Engineer’s Estimates and high unit cost of delivery of infrastructure when compared with other LGs. The assessment under each performance indicator is described in the following sections:

### Indicator 1.1.1

Unit project item costs as per Engineer’s Estimates) **(5 marks)**  
Data collected from 5 sampled projects under the Health Sector in Gulu DLG is presented in 32 below:

| Total score (0 out of 25) |<|<|<|<|<|| 0 |  
| Overall % Score (0 out of 25) |<|<|<|<|<| 0% |<|  


Under this performance indicator, Gulu DLG scored 0 out of 5 marks (0%) which was not a satisfactory performance. The unit costs for the selected project items were not available on the Procurement Files.

### Recommendation

The User Department with support from the office of the District Engineer must ensure that detailed priced Bills of Quantities are prepared for all planned infrastructure developments on the basis of which the Engineer’s Estimates are determined. This will enable the District to allocate adequate budgets for infrastructure developments. The priced Bills of Quantities and the Engineers Estimates should be properly kept on the Procurement Files

### Indicator 1.1.2

Unit project item costs as per signed Contracts  
A review was made of contractors’ unit item rates for all sampled projects in the 30 Local Governments Health Centers and the lowest unit rates for each of the 5 selected project items were determined. A comparison of unit item rates for Health Centers in Gulu DLG was made against the lowest unit item rates among 30 Local Governments for the same selected items. The item score **(S )** was computed using the formula; **S** 2 x F /F,** in **i**

# i = m

which **F** is the lowest unit cost for a particular item across all the 30 selected Higher Local **m**

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Under performance indicator 1.1.2, Gulu DLG scored 3.04 out of 10 marks (30.4%) which was not a satisfactory performance. The findings were that the unit cost of Concrete C25 varied from 255,000/= to 410,000/=, that of Brick Walling from 21,000/= to 25,000/=, that of timber 100 x 50 mm from 6,400/= to 7,400/=, that of corrugated roofing sheets from 22,000 to UGX 28,000/= and that of High Tensile Steel from 4,800/= to UGX 5,800/=. The LG poor performance was attributed to high unit items costs when compared with other LGs.

### Indicator 1.1.3

Unit cost per square meter of building works among the Health Units **(10 marks)**  
A review was made of the unit cost per square metre of building works in the Health Centres sampled in all the 30 selected Local Governments and the lowest unit cost per square metre was selected. A comparison of the unit cost per square meter of building works in Gulu DLG Health Centres was made against the lowest cost per square metre among building works in Health Centres in the selected 30 Higher Local Governments. The unit cost per square meter scores **(S )** is computed using the formula **S** 10 x F /F,** in

# i i = m

which **F** is the lowest unit cost per square meter for similar category of infrastructure **m**  
across all Health Centres in the 30 sampled Local Governments and **F** is the unit cost per square meter of a similar infrastructure in Gulu DLG.  
The score for Gulu DLG derived from cross referencing the unit cost per square meter of building works across the sampled Local Governments was 4.2 out of the total available marks. This low score was attributed to high unit cost of delivery of infrastructure projects in Gulu DLG when compared to the other HLG.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-64_0.png)

### Recommendation

The DLG is urged to use Competitive Bidding methods in the procurement of works to extent practically possible in order to promote competition so as to ensure economy in the delivery of infrastructure.

### (b) To assess the progress of the works against time

Progress of works against time was assessed using physical progress lag (difference between the planned as derived from the initial work program and actual physical progress) and physical progress lag (difference between the planned as derived from the current approved revised work program and actual physical progress).

Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG was not satisfactory (16%), the LG scored 1.6 out of 10 marks as shown in Table 34 below:

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

### Indicator 2.1.1

Physical progress lag – (difference between the planned as derived from initial work program and actual physical progress)  
The Procurement Plans for all the 5 sampled projects did not contain the initial work programs indicating the initial planned commencement and completion dates and therefore it was not possible to calculate the physical progress lag.

### Recommendation

The Bidding Documents must contain a Clause that require the bidders to include the work programs in their bids and failure to do that would lead to declaration of the bid non- compliant. The Procurement and Public Disposal Unit must ensure that complete Bid submissions are kept on Procurement Files.

### Indicator 2.1.2

Physical progress lag – (difference between the planned as derived from the current approved revised work program and actual physical progress)  
Construction of a 2 stance VIP latrine pit at Pugweny HC II and construction of a 2 stance VIP latrine pit and shower at Awach HC IV that scored 5 and 3 marks respectively out of the available 5 marks. The rest of the projects performed poorly scoring 0 out 5.  
The poor performance was attributed to no or inadequate procurement information to enable the VFM Audit team establish the physical progress lag.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-66_0.png)

### Recommendation

The Accounting Officer must ensure that Procurement and Contract Management Files are properly maintained.

### Sub Objective 2.2

To assess the existence and effectiveness of internal controls for certification and payment of executed works  
Overall, (71.14%) which was a fairly satisfactory performance as shown in Table 35 below:

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

For all the sample projects there were no Detailed Measurement sheets attached to the Payment Certificates resulting to a zero score out of the 2 marks earmarked for the indicator. Procurement information for 2 of the 5 sampled projects under the health sector were not availed to the VFM Audit team for verification which affected the overall performance of the sub objective i.e. construction of a 4 stance pit latrine at Binya HC II and construction of a placenta pit at Oitino HC II, each of the projects scored 0 out of the available marks. The rest of the 3 sampled projects performed very well in the 3 indicators (2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4) scoring all the available 2, 4 and 2 marks respectively.

### Recommendation

The Contractor Manager should always ensure that measurement sheets are prepared and attached to the Payment Certificates.

The Accounting Officer must ensure that financial records are properly kept and readily available for verification.

### P7 Completion rate

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, all the five sampled Primary Schools had a completion rate below the target of 2020 of 69.6% scoring zero out of the available 5 marks.

Through interviews held with the head teachers and teachers, it was established that the low rates in P7 completion were attributed to early marriages, coupled with unwanted pregnancies, domestics work like digging, harvesting, babysitting, shop keeping among others, some pupils crossed over to private schools whenever they could reach upper primary level, failure by parents to provide scholastic materials resulted into dropping out of school, parents’ attitude towards education and domestic violence at family level.

### Recommendations

(a) The Chief Administrative Officer should ensure that the parents are sensitized on importance of educating their children and the dangers of child labour.  
(b) The CAO should ensure that ordinance and by laws are enacted at all LG levels to enforce pupils to stay in schools and complete the required primary Education cycle in accordance with the provisions of the Education Act, 2008.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-80_0.png)

### Percentage of pupils passing PLE

Apart from Loyoajanga, Tegot and Kitenyi Owallo Primary Schools which had PLE Passing of 98%, 98% and 91% respectively, the rest of the sampled Primary Schools met the national standard of 100%.

**Pupil attendance Rate**  
All the sampled Primary Schools did not meet the National Standard of 100% for pupil attendance and their rates ranged from 21% to 64.3%.

The absenteeism of pupils was due to negative attitude by parents towards education hence they were reluctant to send their children to attend school regularly and most of the children were involved in domestic work such digging, harvesting among others a factor the contributed their being absent from school.

### Recommendation

The Chief Administrative Officer should work closely with the child protection unit in the Uganda Police Force to stop child labour and early marriages in accordance with labour Laws a situation which was affecting Pupils attendance in Schools.

**(b) To assess the adequacy of human resources in provision of education**

### Services-Efficiency

The adequacy of human resources in provision of education services was measured based on two indicators namely pupil teacher ratio and teacher’s attendance. The data collected from the nine sampled primary schools is presented in Table 43 below.  
Overall Gulu DLG had fairly satisfactory performance with overall % score of 64%.

### Pupil to Teacher ratio (PTR)

From the above table, all the 5 sampled Primary Schools the pupil teacher ratio was within the required national standard of 53:1.

A ratio above the National Standard could lead to effective and efficient learning of pupils and absenteeism of teachers could lead to the pupil’s absenteeism.

**Teacher attendance rate**  
Apart from Wii Aceng and Tegot P/S whose Teacher attendance was 34% and 48% respectively, the rest of the three sampled schools exhibited fair performance with their rates ranging from 74% to 95%.

Through the interviews with the head teacher, the teacher’s absenteeism was attributed to inadequate number of teachers houses as a result teachers were compelled to walk long distances from their wherever they were residing.

### Recommendation

The Chief Administrative Officer should take disciplinary action against teachers who perpetual absent themselves from schools.  
Teachers’ houses should be provided in critical schools.

### (c) To assess the adequacy/contribution of external oversight to the quality of services delivered in the school

The adequacy of external oversight to the quality of services delivered in the school was measured by number of school inspections, proportion of recommendations implemented and functionality of SMCs. The data collected was presented in Table 44 below:

### School Inspection

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, apart from Kitenyi Owallo Primary School which was inspected twice in the academic year, the rest of the four sampled schools were inspected at least once per term as required by the Education Act 2008.:

### Implementation of inspection recommendations by school

With the exception of Tegot and Wii Aceng Primary Schools which attained the maximum score of 100% each, in the implementation of the recommendations by the inspectors, the rest of the three sampled schools had performance ranging from 40.63% to 88.89%.

### Functionality of SMCs

Apart from Tegot P/S and Loyoajonga P/S whose SMCS met once a term and scored all the available 2 marks, the rest of the three sampled Primary Schools had their SMCS meeting below the requirement number of at least three meetings in the calendar year 2018 and scored zero out of 2 marks.

### (d) Unit costs of delivering services under education sector

The unit cost of services delivered per student was measured by amount spent per pupil, funds spent on district supervision and school inspection. The data collected from the five schools is presented in the table below

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-83_0.png)

### Amount spent per pupil per term

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, apart from Kitenyi Owallo and Tegot Primary schools had amount spent per pupil of Shs23,240 and shs21,995 beyond the average of Shs 8988 of the LG, the three Primary Schools namely Wii-Aceng, Acet and Loyoajonga Primary Schools had no data. This is because the sampled projects were implemented in FY 2015/16 by Gulu district LG. However, the said sampled project belonged to Omoro District which had been created out of Gulu district. In the circumstances the VFM team was unable to pick data related to wage for the teachers from Omoro DLG since it was not in the audit sample by OAG. Therefore, the said attained a maximum score of 5.

**Sensitization/District supervision**  
Kitenyi Owallo and Tegot Primary schools had expenditure on District supervision within the District average of Shs10,819,788 against the Minimum across 30 LGs was UGX 1,800,000 (Gulu DLG) and Maximum Across LGs was Shs UGX25,343,000 (Ibanda MLG).

### Recommendation

(a)  
The Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development should continue releasing funds to LG to cater for supervision of schools; and,

(b)  
The District Education Officer should disaggregate the costs of inspecting each school because of varying distances instead of lumpsum.

### Available number of classrooms per number of pupils

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, apart from Wii Aceng which had a ratio of 1:29 within the National Standard of 1:55, the rest of the four sampled primary schools had ratios which were above the standard of 1:55.  
The high classroom pupil ratio arose out of increased enrolment numbers of pupils and inadequate financial resources in the district to construct more classrooms to match the increased enrolment.  
Limited classes vis viz increased enrolment resulted into overcrowding in class. Additionally, the situation could lead to poor learning environment.

### Recommendation

The Ministry of Education and Sports should work closely with Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to allocate more funds to Gulu DLG to construct more classrooms.

### Available number of latrine stances per number of pupils

From the above table, a part from Acet and Wii-Aceng Primary Schools which had pit latrine stance to pupil ratio within the required standard of 1:40 and scored all the available 5 marks. The rest of the eight of the sampled primary schools had their ratios below the required standard of 1:40 resulting to a zero score.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-88_0.png)

Through the interviews and discussions with the head teachers and the teachers, it was established that the high ratios arose out of increased enrolment of pupils, coupled with inadequate financial resources in the District to construct more pit latrines.

Inadequate pit latrine stances probably could lead to dropout of pupils from schools. Additionally, poor sanitation and hygiene which could lead to outbreak of epidemics.

### Recommendation

The CAO should work closely with the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development to allocate more funds to Gulu DLG to construct Pit latrines to match the increasing enrolment numbers of Pupils.

### Available number of desk per number of pupils

Apart from Wii-Aceng Primary School had pupil- desk ratio whose ratio was within the required standard of 1:3 and scored all the available 5 marks, the rest of the eight sampled primary schools had their ratios below the required standard of 1:3 scoring zero out of 5 marks.

Through the interviews and discussions with the head teachers and the teachers, it was established that the high ratios arose out of increased enrolment of pupils, coupled with inadequate financial resources in the District to purchase more desks.

Inadequate desks viz increased enrolment numbers of pupils could lead to pupils sitting on the floor.

### Recommendation

The CAO should work closely with the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development to allocate more funds to Gulu DLG to procure desks to match the increasing enrolment numbers of Pupils.

### Available number of text books per number of pupils

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

Apart from Kitenyi Owallo Primary School which had pupil- text book ratio below the required standard of 1:1 and scored zero out of 2 marks. The rest of the four (4) sampled primary schools had their ratios within the required standard of 1:1 and scored full marks.

Through the interviews and discussions with the head teachers and the teachers, it was established that the high ratios arose out of increased enrolment of pupils, coupled with inadequate financial resources in the District to purchase more text books.

### Recommendation

The CAO should work closely with the Ministry of Education and Sports and other Stakeholders such as USAID to continue supporting the Schools in the provision of Textbooks.

**Availability of library**  
All the five sampled primary schools had no libraries and therefore scored zero out of 1 mark.  
Lack library and inadequate text books could lead to dependency of pupils to only class notes provided by the teacher.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-89_0.png)

### Recommendation

The CAO should work closely with the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development to allocate more funds to Gulu DLG to construct Libraries to match the increasing enrolment numbers of Pupils.

### Availability of staff housing for at least 4 teachers

All the sampled primary schools had staff houses for at least four teachers.

The Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development and other Development Partners should continue Supporting the District in the provision of Teachers Houses.

### Availability of at least one playground

All the sampled primary schools had playgrounds.

**3.2**

### Delivery of services under the Health sector

The performance in the delivery of services in the Health Sector was measured using 3 parameters, viz;  
(i) the quality of health services;  
(ii) the usability and functionality of health facilities; and,  
(iii) The availability of vital health infrastructure.

To assess the quality of health services involved:

- The assessment of the provision of health services at the facility level;
- Availability of essential medicines and health supplies; and,
- The adequacy of human resources in provision of health services.

To assess usability and functionality of health facilities involved:

- Assessing the level of usage and functionality of health facilities.

To assess the availability of vital health infrastructure involved:

Satisfactory performance is indicated by the green colour, Fairly Satisfactory by the yellow colour and Not satisfactory by the Pink colour.

# (a) Assess the provision of health services at the facility level (Efficiency)

The provision of health services at the facility level was measured by fresh still births of per 1000 deliveries, maternal death per 100000 deliveries and Average length of stay (ALOS).  
Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG was Not Satisfactory (55.00%) as shown in table 49 below.

###### Fresh still birth 11/1000 deliveries

VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, Awach H/C IV had the fresh still births below the target of 11/1000, had no maternal deaths and the Average length of stay (ALOS) of the in- patients was 3 days. The rest of three sampled health Centres were H/CIIs, had no in- patient’s admissions and did not carry out deliveries.

Through the interviews and discussions with doctor and Mid wives, it was reported that the occurrence of fresh still births was due to:



- Late referral from lower units to only available health centre IV;
- Limited knowledge of Mid wives to timely detect the risk during delivery of mothers; and,
- Delay by mothers to make quick decision to report to complication and delay by health staff to carryout operation.

High fresh still births could probably lead to Loss of babies and loss of financial resources in handling such cases.

### Recommendation

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-91_0.png)

The District Health Officer Gulu District Local Government should develop a strong and quick referral system at the lower level health units and mothers should be sensitized to access antennal services regularly.

### Maternal Death

Awach HC IV did not register any maternal deaths in the fy 2017/18 under review. This was an indication that the mothers were taking antenatal services and emergency cases were handled expeditiously.

### Average Length of stay (ALOS)

Awach HC IV had average Length of stay for inpatients admitted of 3.4 days which was below the minimum requirement of 5 days. The rest of three sampled health Centres were H/CIIs and had no in-patient’s admissions, therefore this indicator was not applicable.

# (b) Assess availability of essential medicines and health supplies

The availability of essential medicines and health supplies was measured by level of no stock out (percentage). Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG was 82.5% which was fairly satisfactory. The details from the respective health units is presented in Table 50 below:

### Table 50:

Availability of essential medicines and health supplies of the four sampled H/Cs in Gulu DLG

| **HC Name** | **Availability of essential medicines and health supplies** |<|<|<|<|  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
|^| **Total no supplies** | **Supplies out of stock** | **Level of stock outs (Percentage )** | **Score out of 10 marks** | **Overall % score 33 out of 40** |  
| Oitino Health Centre II | 41 | 0 | 100 | 10 | **82.5%** |  
| Binya Health Centre II | 41 | 4 | 90 | 9 |^|  
| Pugwinyi Health Centre II Patiko | 41 | 12 | 71 | 5 |^|  
| Awach HC IV | 41 | 2 | 95 | 9 |^|

---

Baseline Value for Money Audit/Assessment of the UgIFT Program VfMA Report for FY 2017/18

From the above table, apart from Oitino H/C II which had 100% level of no stock out of essential medicines and health supplies, the rest of the three H/Cs had a range from 71% to 95%.

When the respective in-charges of the four sample health centres were interviewed, it was reported that stock out of medicines and health supplies arose due to delayed reporting of stock outs by the facility in-charge and delay in supply by the National Medical Stores.

Non availability of essential medicines could lead to Patients being referred to purchase medicines, gloves, cotton from private drug shops and pharmacies.

### Recommendations

The Ministry of Health should work closely with National Medical stores to ensure regular supplies of essential medicines to health units.

# (c) To assess the adequacy of human resources in provision of health services

The adequacy of human resources in provision of health services was measured by the numbers of staff filled against the approved staff for each level of the health unit. The data collected from the four health centres is presented in Table 51 below:

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-92_0.png)

# Table 51 :

| **4.** | Awach HC IV | 41 | 50 | 82 | 15 |^|  


All the four sampled Health Centres had their staffing levels above the national standard of 65%. Gulu District LG had duly filled the key posts and Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development had provided enough funds for wages to recruit the staff.

Adequacy of staff could lead to effective and efficient health service delivery in health units.

Overall, the performance of Gulu DLG was satisfactory (100%), the LG scored 10 out of 10 marks.

### Recommendation

Gulu District LG should ensure that the staffs in post are retained.

### (d) Contribution of external oversight to the quality of services delivered in the HCs

The contribution to external oversight to quality of services delivered in the HCs was measured by the numbers times of the supervisions made against the expected quarterly. The data collected from the health centres is presented in Table 52 below:

| **3.** | Pugwinyi Health Centre II Patiko | 4 | 3  8 |<|^|  
| **4.** | Awach HC IV | 4 | 2  4 |<|^|  


From the above table, apart from Oitino H/C which had no documentary evidence that Quarterly integrated support supervision was carried out, the rest of the three sampled health centres had been supervised by the District health team and District health management Committee. The number of supervision visits ranged from 1 to 3 times in the FY 2017/18.

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-93_0.png)

For the case of Oitino H/C II the in-charge was reportedly out of station and the staff found in the health centre could not trace the supervision log books.

The limited number of supervision visits arose due to the failure by the District Health Officer to prevail over the in -charges of H/C III to supervise H/C IIs and H/C IVs to supervise H/C III.

Failure to adequately supervise H/Cs could lead to ineffective and inefficient service delivery in the health centres.

Overall, Gulu DLG scored 4 out of 10 marks (40%) which was not a satisfactory performance in Quarterly Integrated Support Supervision by the District Health Team and District Health Management team.

# (e) Usability and functionality of health facilities

The level of usage and functionality of health facilities was measured by Bed occupancy rate, Admission per 100 population and percentage of unutilised equipment. The Data collected was presented in Table 53 below:

![](assets_AuditReports%5CGulu%20District%5CVFM%20PSM_VFM_VFM_2017_18_1649144445/img-94_0.png)

From the above table, Awach Health Centre IV had 19/100 patients admitted higher that the National standard of 10/100 and the Bed occupancy rate was 1.2%. Apart from Awach H/C IV which had 90% of the equipment being utilised, the rest of the three sampled H/CIIs had 100% of the equipment were being utilised.

The high number of patients per 100 populations in Awach H/C IV arose due to increased number of patients who are referred from the many lower health centres. Similarly, the low bed occupancy rate was due to committed staff and availability of medicines for treatment of patients.  
Utilization of equipment could lead to efficient and Effective service delivery in the Health Centres and limited admissions could lead to no congestion in the Health Centre IV wards.  
Overall, Gulu DLG scored 20 out of 20 marks (100%) which was a satisfactory performance.

### Recommendation

The District health department should further strengthen the OPD to handle most of the cases and the LGs should carry out sensitization in the communities on disease preventive measures.

# (f) Availability of vital Health Infrastructure

The presence of vital Health Infrastructure and equipment necessary for provision of health services was measured by availability of medical buildings, staff housing and equipment. The data collected from the health centres is presented in Table 54 below.

Overall, Gulu DLG scored 30 out of 30 marks (100%) which was a satisfactory performance in the presence of vital Health Infrastructure and equipment necessary for provision of health services.

From the above table, the entire four health centres sampled had medical buildings and equipment. The medical buildings included: - H/C IV had the following OPD, drug store, theatre, three wards (children, male and female wards), maternity ward, isolation ward for TB and Measles patients, Consultation room, Laboratory, antenatal care room, placenta pit, and incinerator while HC IIs had OPD, emergency delivery room, placenta pit, medical waste pit, and drug store. The equipment that were in place among others included: - Height board, five machines for measuring BP, three stethoscopes, microscope, one infant weighing scale, vaccine fridge, dental chair, blood bank deep freezer, two delivery beds, and sputum analyzer machine. All health centres had house staffing levels above the requirement of 50% of the staff in post.

Availability of adequate staff house was due to various stakeholders such as Ministry of health and development partners such as UNICEF, NUSAF II among others that supported the health units to construct the staff houses.

Presence of medical building, equipment and staff houses could lead to efficient and effective service delivery in the Health Centres

### Recommendation

Gulu District Local Government should ensure that the good performance in medical buildings and equipment, staff house should be maintained.
