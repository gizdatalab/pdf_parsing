EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Public land management is the process by which public land is put to good effect. It focuses on establishing and sustaining an optimum balance of use, conservation and development of resources in harmony with the values and needs of society.

Vision 2040 prioritizes Land as a crucial resource for provision of public utilities and calls for sustainable land use and management as one of the fundamentals to be strengthened in order to harness the country’s abundant opportunities. Whereas Government owns vast land comprising numerous properties, used by government agencies to perform their functions in the delivery of services to Citizens, many government entities have had challenges in management of public land. These include; inadequate record keeping, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, and lack of land titles, uncoordinated and unstandardized approach to acquisition of land for public use, among others.

Subsequent to these challenges and others I have reported upon over time, I undertook a compliance study in 57 selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Authorities (LAs), over a period of four years, to assess whether Government had efficiently and effectively managed public land for better service delivery to the Citizens, and in accordance with the existing Legal and reporting frameworks, The following were my summary findings, recommendations and overall conclusion;

KEY FINDINGS

Strategic Planning for Land acquisition and Compensations

Nineteen (19) entities that acquired land out of the 57 sampled entities in the period under review indicated that, only nine (9) entities (47%) included lands acquisitions in their strategic plans, while ten (10) entities (53%) did not. This was mainly attributed to laxity by management not to strategically plan provide complete recording of land size and approximate land cost in the plans. In addition four (04) entities did not specify the sizes/cost of land to be acquired

Budgeting, funding, and absorption of funds, for land acquisition

Fifteen (15) entities included land acquisition in their annual budgets for the period under review, while four (04) entities acquired land without budgets. The fifteen (15) entities budgeted for acquisition of 17,831 hectares of land at a cost of UGX 483.58Bn; the entities were availed UGX 447.54Bn (93%), and acquired 25,786 hectares at a total cost of UGX 435.256Bn (including a mischarge of 1.74Bn which was not budgeted for land acquisition) leaving a sum of UGX 14.03 (3% of availed funds) un-utilised. However, Ministry of Defence which acquired 7,562.07 hectares at a cost of UGX 84.64Bn did not indicate the land size in its budgets. I further noted that four (4) entities acquired 5.06 hectares of land at a total of UGX 20.47Bn without budgeting (both size and amount) Out the seven (7) entities that received inadequate funding (budgeted for UGX 333.613Bn and received UGX 297.531Bn (89%)) for land acquisition in the period under review. I further noted that Wakiso and Oyam DLGs diverted a sum of UGX 0.354Bn from funds for land acquisition in the period under review.











Compliance of Land Acquisition with the Relevant Laws

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, eight (8) entities acquired a total of 3,937.336 hectares at a cost of UGX 79.77Bn directly without competitive participation. The procurement methods used by six (6) entities in the acquisition of 1,666.016 hectares costing UGX 62.83Bn were not approved by the Contracts Committee. I further noted that two (2) entities commenced acquisition of 319.6 hectares of land costing UGX 6.72Bn without confirmation of availability of funding. In addition, seven (7) entities acquired 15,760.82 hectares with a value above the 200m threshold each at a total cost of UGX 64.76Bn without clearance from the Attorney General.

Involvement of Uganda Land Commission

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review , five (5) entities acquired 1,669.84 hectares at a cost of UGX 45.9Bn prior to notifying the Uganda Land Commission to enable effective public land management, including advising on availability of other options. I also observed that there was no coordination by the various government entities with ULC in regard to land acquisition.

Valuation by the Chief Government valuer

Out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, two (2) entities procured 1.96 hectares at a cost of UGX 1.6Bn without obtaining CGV valuation; I also noted that the CGV took more than twenty (20) working days in approving consultants’ valuation reports on land government projects contrary to the statutory timelines. Delayed valuation of Land by the CGV may result into increase in project costs, delayed commencement of infrastructure projects which affects loan absorption rates, and increases commitment charges arising from undisbursed loans from multilateral and bilateral lenders.

Registration and Titling Of Land

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, forty two (42) entities did not have land titles for a total of 4,398 pieces of land comprising twenty six (26) entities which had 1,638 pieces of land measuring approximately 80,038.88 hectares and sixteen (16) entities held 2,760 pieces with unknown land sizes. I also noted that seven (7) entities which held 81 pieces of land measuring 12,521.1 hectares had land titles for all the pieces of land held. The anomalies were attributed to the following; inadequate funds by the entities to process land titles and land having been donated by individuals who passed on without transferring title to the entity, delays by MZOs to effect registration and transfers, continuous acquisitions of land and delays in the survey process. Lack of Land titles results into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land.











respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. The non-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land which could easily lead to loss and /or misstatement of the non- produced asset in the financial statements.

Utilization of Government Land for Delivery of Service

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 29 entities did not utilise a total of 258 pieces of land measuring approximately 10,066.8 hectares of land held by 30th June 2022. Non-utilisation and use of land for unapproved use defeats the purpose for acquisition which may affect Government’s ability to achieve its intended objectives and deliver services its citizens. In addition, thirty four (34) entities had 434 pieces of land encroached upon, of these, 182 pieces measured approximately 61,207.04 hectares. Ninety-six 96 of the 182 pieces of land cost UGX 134.4Bn, while 252 of the 434 pieces had unknown measurements. Land encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the affected land for the intended purposes.

Lease of Public Land

I noted that all the nine (9) entities with a total of 573 leases did not have updated lease registers for proper management of leases. This has led to increased litigations resulting from multiple allocation of leases; loss of land and revenue due to late or non- billing for ground rent, and lease premiums; which impact on service delivery to the citizens. Sixteen (16) leases granted by six (6) entities had expired, Six (6) entities did not receive lease rentals of UGX 1.13Bn from eighty five (85) leases, and Two (2) entities irregularly renewed three (3) leases without realisation of ground rent arrears or development of land as per lease agreement. In addition, Seven (7) entities without mandate to lease out government land granted thirteen one (31) leases.

Allocation of Land by District Land Boards (DLB)

I noted that there was no comprehensive database of Public Land by the DLB’s. As a result, 2 District Land Boards (DLBs) allocated 4 pieces of land which were not under their jurisdiction.

Management of Land outside Uganda

The land act mandates the ULC to hold and manage any land acquired by the Government abroad, except that the Commission may delegate the management of such land to Uganda’s missions abroad. I noted that ULC neither had information concerning government land abroad nor delegated management of such land to Uganda’s missions abroad. There is a risk of mismanagement of government land abroad.

1. Ensure that the size, amount and purpose for proposed land acquisitions are included in the respective strategic plans of entities to enable attainment of NDP III objectives and guide effective preparation of annual entity budgets,
2. Liaise with PS/ST to ensure that funds appropriated for acquisition of land are availed and in addition, ensure that availed funds for land acquisition in the period to which they relate are utilised for the intended purpose,











3. Ensure that appropriate procurement methods are adhered to in regards to land acquisitions. For MDAs with peculiar requirements, the Accounting Officers should always endeavour to ratify the procurements with the contracts committee. In addition, PPDA should provide additional guidelines to address the unique needs for land acquisition by MALGs,
4. To coordinate with ULC when acquiring Public land to ensure that before acquisition, all available options through Uganda Land Commission are exhausted,
5. I advise the Accounting Officer of the ministry of lands to ensure that approval of consultant’s valuation reports on government projects are always fast-tracked to avoid project delays and increasing liability to government,
6. Engage with MoFPED to secure funding to facilitate land titling, Ministry of Lands is advised to streamline and expedite process of titling public land,
7. I advise the Attorney General to give a general guidance to corporate government entities in regard to the custody of entity land with ULC,
8. I advise the Accountant General to ensure that the asset module under the GFMIS is functioning properly. In addition, I advised the respective Accounting Officer to update both the fixed asset registers and the asset module under the GFMIS,
9. Institute mechanisms to ensure that land utilization plans are developed by entities. I further advised the PS/ST to address the funding deficits for land utilization in MALGs. Meanwhile the Accounting Officers should ensure that the un-utilized land is protected against encroachments,
10. Ensure that comprehensive lease registers are maintained for proper management of leased land,
11. Ensure strict adherence to the internal controls and compliance with land allocation procedures, and
12. Engage and liaise with other Government agencies to ensure that the provisions in the law concerning management of government land abroad are fulfilled.

OVERALL CONCLUSION

Whereas a number of entities were observed to have complied with the existing land management frameworks, all entities did not notify Uganda land Commission before acquisition of land. The limitation by the individual public entities, including: inadequate planning for land acquisition; absorption of released funds for land acquisition; adherence to the procurement regulations, including direct procurement recording of land and utilization of the land asset, together with inadequacies in land management by the Uganda Land commission and District land boards, and limited release of funds has led to; increased public land encroachment, diversion of funds of up to UGX 379 Million, payables which affect service delivery to the citizens.











INTRODUCTION

1.0 BACKGROUND

Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) requires the Accounting Officers to be responsible for the management of the land under their custody. Public land management is the process by which public land resources are put to proper utilization. Paragraph 16.13.11 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that for a government entity to be considered to have control over land only when it has the title.

The current financial reporting framework requires Land to be recognized as Non-produced assets in the statement of financial position (effective 2014) for all reporting entities on both Modified accrual and accrual basis of Accounting. The framework further requires land procured prior to 2014, and where the value cannot be ascertained to be recorded in the memorandum statement to the financial statements.

Public land management is the process by which public land is put to good effect. It focuses on establishing and sustaining an optimum balance of use, conservation and development of resources in harmony with the values and needs of society 1 . It involves the systematic process of planning, acquiring, maintaining, utilising, disposing and recording of land in a cost-effective manner.

I observed that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and Local Governments (LGs) have challenges with regard to planning and budgeting, protecting, reporting, utilization and disposal of Public Land. These challenges include; inadequate record keeping, non-compliance to recognition and measurement criteria, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, and lack of land titles, among others. These have negatively affected the quality of financial statements, and hampered service delivery and fulfilment of entity mandates.

Over the years, inadequacies in public land management have been among the major bottlenecks of effective and efficient service delivery in Uganda 2 .

1.1 JUSTIFICATION Vision 2040 and NDP III Requirements on Public Land Management

The Uganda Vision 2040 calls for sustainable land use and management as one of the fundamentals to be strengthened in order to harness the country’s abundant opportunities 3 . The failure by Government to comply with the land management requirements stipulated in the NDP III may increase unsustainable land use practices. Under Vision 2040, Government prioritized Land as a crucial resource for provision of public utilities. Interventions such as computerizing of the Land registration system to ensure efficient and effective land management were to be undertaken. Howevr, this has not been fully implemented to link the targets of Vision 2040 to attain Government proposed vision.











NDPIII further recognises that here is uncoordinated and unstandardized approach to acquisition of land for public use. Currently, resources for acquisition of land to public use are spread across a number of implementing institutions leading to ad hoc efforts, duplication and disparities in valuation of land. This has highly contributed to delays and high cost of public investment. In addition, there is mismanagement of Government land due to lack of a comprehensive Government land inventory and weak land use planning. This has led to encroachment of Government land and endangering of Government facilities 4 .

Substantial Expenditure on Land Acquisition and Compensations

A review of the Consolidated Audited Financial Statements of Government for the financial years 2017/18, 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 under review, I noted that government spent a total of UGX 2.48 trillion on land acquisition and compensation. As a result, the cumulative value of recognised (capitalised) land over the years increased to UGX 4.2trillion in the FY2020/21. Despite the substantial expenditure on land acquisition by government, there is a risk that the Land may not have been put to proper use, registered, recorded and be free from encumbrances for effective service delivery.

Auditor General Reports

Over time, the Auditor General identified weaknesses in the management of public land, such as: absence of a comprehensive Government Land Inventory; encroachment on Government land and protected areas; challenges and gaps in land acquisitions for government projects; non- operationalization of the Land Fund; multiple lease allocations; and increasing payables arising from land acquisition and compensation.

Coordination among key stakeholders in Management of Land

The legal and policy framework guiding land governance in Uganda is enshrined in several laws, such as: the 1995 Constitution (as amended) Article 240); the National Environment Management Act, 2019; the Uganda Land Act, 1998 (as amended) and the Registration of Titles Act Cap 230.However the legal frameworks do not explicitly bring out the issues of Management of Public Land and Administration and according to the Management of the Uganda Land Commission there is need for enactment of specific Law to streamline the matters of Public Land Management and Administration amongst the stakeholders.

Conflicting Mandates in Management of Land

Whereas Section 49 of the Land Act Cap 227 lays out the functions of Uganda Land Commission which include among others the holding and managing any of land acquired by the Government in Uganda and abroad where applicable, except where the Commission may delegate the management of such land to Uganda’s Missions abroad, other government entities were holding the similar mandate. Uganda Property Holdings Ltd was established in 1998 pursuant to a Cabinet decision to own and manage all real estate properties abroad belonging to the Uganda government including mission properties, and to provide alternative means of offering real estate development services to Government through purchase, lease, exchange, construction or otherwise so as to allow smooth operations of Government services. Furthermore, public universities and state corporations and statutory bodies have the mandate to own and hold land. The overlapping mandates set out in the legal and policy frameworks have a potential of causing controversies regarding management and administration of public land.











Concerns raised by different Stakeholders on Public Land Management

There have been several concerns raised by the different stakeholders in regard to mismanagement of public land in MDAs and LGs. H.E the President 5 , Parliament 6 and the media raised concerns which led to the decision to appoint a Commission of Inquiry on 8 th December 2016 headed by the Justice Bamugemereire and the suspension of the officials of the ULC on the 7 th April 2022. Furthermore, on 1 st March 2022, Parliament of Uganda set up an adhoc Committee to investigate the Naguru-Nakawa land.

Legal and Internal Control Requirements

Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires Accounting Officers to be responsible for the management of assets pertaining to their Votes and for the Accountant General to issue guidelines for accounting, recording and reporting on such assets. In addition, Section 34(2) of the PFMA, 2015 requires government entities, to have a manual and electronic register, in a form (TF 89,) maintained for all assets. Despite the presence of the legal framework, many government entities have failed to comply with the above provisions.

Furthermore, the current reporting format in the Financial Statements requires Land to be recognised as Non-produced assets in the statement of financial position (effective 2014) for all reporting entities on both Modified accrual and accrual basis of Accounting. The current reporting requirement leads to understatement of the value/balances.

The Office of the Auditor General, as result of the foregoing, decided to undertake an audit in the management of Public Land and suggest recommendations to improve transparency, accountability and service delivery.

1.2 AUDIT OBJECTIVES

- General Audit Objective To assess whether Government has efficiently and effectively managed public land for better service delivery to the Citizens in accordance with the existing Legal and reporting frameworks.

PLANNING, BUDGETING & FUNDING FOR LAND ACQUISITION

4.1.1 Strategic Planning for Land acquisition and Compensations

Regulation 25 (1) of The National Planning Authority (Development Plans) Regulations, 2018 requires a decentralised planning institution (Ministry, Department or Agency of Government, a sector or Local government) to prepare a decentralized development plan highlighting the development needs of the institution.

A review of the strategic plans for the 19 entities that acquired land out of the 57 sampled entities in the period under review indicated that, only nine (9) entities (47%) included lands acquisitions in their strategic plans, while 10 entities (53%) did not. Details in Appendix 4 refers. Out the nine (9) entities that included land acquisition in their plans four (04) did not specify the sizes/cost of land to be acquired. Table 1 refers.

Whereas Accounting Officers did not provide explanations for the omissions, I noted laxity on the side of management. There is a risk that the NDPIII objectives may not be achieved as well as not providing adequate information for preparation of the annual entity budgets.

Recommendation The Accounting Officers should ensure that the size, amount and purpose for proposed land acquisitions are included in the respective strategic plans of entities to enable attainment of NDP III objectives and guide effective preparation of annual entity budgets.

4.1.2 Budgeting, funding, and absorption of funds, for land acquisition

Instruction 3.9.5 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 requires the budget estimates to be based on the pre-determined objectives and outputs as provided in the strategic plans of the sector/entity.

Section 45 (3) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 as amended requires an Accounting Officer to enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a Financial year (FY).

A review of the budgets for 19 entities that acquired land revealed that fifteen (15) entities (included land acquisition in their annual budgets for the period under review, while four (04) entities acquired land without budgets.

Further analysis revealed that whereas fifteen (15) entities budgeted for acquisition of 17,831 hectares of land at a cost of UGX 483.58Bn; the entities were availed UGX.447.54Bn (93%), and acquired 25,786 hectares at a total cost of UGX.435.256Bn (including a mischarge of 1.74Bn which was not budgeted for land acquisition) leaving a sum of UGX 14.03 (3% of availed funds) un-utilised. Appendix 5 refers and Table 3 summarises below.

Out the seven (7) entities that received inadequate funding (budgeted for UGX 333.613Bn and received UGX 297.531Bn (89%)) for land acquisition in the period under review. I further noted that Wakiso and Oyam DLGs diverted a sum of UGX 0.354Bn from funds for land acquisition in the period under review.

I was not provided with satisfactory response to the above identified anomalies. The inadequacies in planning, budgeting, absorption and diversion of funds negatively impact on the acquisition of public land.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officers to;

- Liaise with PS/ST to ensure that funds appropriated for acquisition of land are availed.
- Ensure that availed funds for land acquisition in the period to which they relate.
- Ensure that availed funds for land acquisition of land are utilised for the intended purpose.

4.2

COMPLIANCE OF LAND ACQUISITION WITH THE RELEVANT LAWS

5. in the period under review revealed the following;











a) Direct procurement of Land without sufficient Justification

According to Section 85 (2) of the PPDA Act, 2003, direct procurement shall be used to achieve efficient and timely procurement where the circumstances prevent the use of competition.

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, eight (8) entities acquired a total of 3,937.336 hectares at a cost of UGX 79.77Bn directly without competitive participation. Details are summarised in Table 5below;

The anomaly was attributed to the peculiarity of the entity needs that required specific land locations. For instance, the Accounting Officer of MoWE noted that the water projects are location specific once identified while the Accounting Officer of Gulu University explained that there was no alterative land to meet the University’s land needs. The Accounting officers who did not confirm availability of funding before procurement regretted the anomaly.

Whereas the Accounting Officers’ explanations is indicative of challenges to comply with PPDA requirements due to the peculiarities of user needs requirements, I noted that there are no specific guidelines in regards to land acquisitions by MALGs. Direct procurements may result into acquisition of Land at inflated prices and wastage of Public resources.

Recommendation The Accounting Officers should always ensure that procurement appropriate procurement methods are adhered too in regards to land acquisitions. For MDAs with peculiar requirements, the Accounting officers should always endeavour to ratify the procurements with the contracts committee. In addition, PPDA is advised to provide additional guidelines to address the unique needs for land acquisitions by MALGs.











Table 6: Procurement method not approved by Contract Committee 5

	Entity	Size (hectares)	Not approved by CC “Bn”	
1	Ministry of Agriculture	1,342.61	36.25	
3	Uganda Police	1.2	0.74	
4	State House	0.686	18.00	
Directorate of Citizenship & Immigration Control	1.957	0.86	
6	Gulu University	318	6.54	
7	Uganda Revenue Authority	1.563	0.44	
	TOTAL	1,666.016	62.83	




No appropriate reasons for the non-compliance were provided by the respective Accounting Officers in regard to use of unapproved procurement methods; however, audit attributed this to non-compliance with PPDA requirements.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officers to ensure that all procurements are in accordance with PPDA Guidelines to enhance value for money. However, in circumstances where compliance with the PPDA legal framework is impractical in meeting the specific user needs, I advise the PPDA to issue additional guidelines to address the unique needs for land acquisitions by the affected MALGs.

c) Initiation of Procurement without confirmation of Funding

Instruction 8.10.2 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017, requires entity contracts to be signed after confirmation of the availability of funds. Section 59(2) of the PPDA Act 2003 requires a Procurement to only be initiated upon confirmation of availability of funds.

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, two (2) entities commenced acquisition of 319.6 hectares of land costing UGX 6.72Bn without confirmation of availability of funding. Details are in the Table 7below;

Table 7: Non-confirmation of availability of funding

Entity	Size ( hectares)	Amount UGX “ Bn”	
Uganda Revenue Authority	1.563	0.178	
Gulu University	318.000	6.54	
Total	319.563	6.72	














d) Purchase of Land above UGX.200m without the clearance of the Attorney General

Section 119(5) the Constitution of Uganda, 1995 prohibits any agreement, contract, treaty, convention or document to which the Government is a party or in respect of which the Government has an interest, to be concluded without legal advice from the Attorney General. In addition, statutory instrument No. 97, 2014 issued by Attorney General exempts only contract involving an amount less than two hundred million shillings (UGX 200,000,000).

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, seven (7) entities acquired 15,760.82 hectares with a value above the 200m threshold each at a total cost of UGX 64.76Bn without clearance from the Attorney General.

The anomaly was attributed to the failure by the Accounting Officers to seek Attorney General’s clearance which may result into signing of contracts/agreements which are unfavourable to government.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officers to obtain the Attorney General clearance for all contracts exceeding the set thresholds.

4.2.2 Non-Involvement of ULC prior to acquisition of Land 7

Section 49 (b) of the Land Act, Cap 227, states that: the Uganda Land Commission shall hold and manage any land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government in accordance with the Constitution. Paragraph 5.2.5 of the GoU Asset Management Framework and Guidelines 2020, issued by the Accountant General further requires the Uganda Land Commission to be informed of the land acquisition by other entities so as to update the GOU comprehensive Land register.

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review , five (5) entities acquired 1,669.84 hectares at a cost of UGX 45.9Bn prior to notifying the Uganda Land Commission to enable effective public land management, including advising on availability of other options. Details in Table 8 below;

Table 8: Non-involvement of ULC prior to acquisition

No	Entity	Land acquired without notification of ULC		
		Size (hectares)	Amount UGX “Bn”	
1	Ministry of Agriculture	1,342.61	36.25	
2	Directorate of Citizenship & Immigration Control	1.957	0.86	
3	Ministry of Education and Sports	5.71	1.81	
4	Gulu University	318	6.54	
5	Uganda Revenue Authority	1.563	0.44	
		1,669.84	45.9	














I observed that there was no coordination by the various government entities with ULC in regard to land acquisition.

Non-involvement of the Uganda Land Commission in the acquisition of Land by the respective entities may affect effective management of Public Land by ULC. In addition, Government entities may fail to attain better land options.

Recommendation I advise government entities to coordinate with ULC when acquiring Public land to ensure that before acquisition, all available options through Uganda Land Commission are exhausted.

4.2.3

Non-Involvement of the CGV in the acquisition of Land

Section 6 (1) b of the Land Acquisition Act, Cap 226 requires assessment officer (Chief Government Valuer) to hold an inquiry into claims and objections made in respect of the land and make an award specifying the compensation which in his or her opinion should be allowed for the land.

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, two (2) entities procured 1.96 hectares at a cost of UGX 1.6Bn without obtaining CGV valuation. The Table 9 below refers.

Table 9: No CGV Valuation

No	Entity	Size (hectares)	Amount UGX”Bn”	
1	Uganda Police	Not specified	0.74	
2	Directorate of Citizenship & Immigration Control	1.957	0.86	
		1.96	1.6	




Non-involvement of the Chief Government Valuer in the valuation of land may result into uneconomical acquisition of land.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting officers to adhere to government requirement of valuation of land by CGV before acquisition.

4.2.4

Delays in processing the request for valuation by the CGV 8











I noted that the CGV took more than 20 working days in approving consultants’ valuation reports on land acquisition for roads, way leaves and others in public interest for (9 Projects) pieces of contrary to the timeline set out in the Section 2.2 of the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development Clients’ Charter 2017/18 – 2020/21 as summarized in the table below and detailed in Appendix 6 refers.

Delayed valuation of Land by the CGV resulted into increase in project costs, delayed commencement of infrastructure projects which affects loan absorption rates, and increases commitment charges arising from undisbursed loans from multilateral and bilateral lenders.

Whereas MoLHUD in its clients’ charter is expected to approve request for valuation within 15 working days, the Accounting Officer explained that the approval of the consultant’s reports is on a case by case basis upon review and that where the reports are found to be satisfactory, approvals are granted expeditiously.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officer to ensure that approval of consultant’s valuation reports on government projects are always fast-tracked to avoid project delays and increasing liability to government.

4.3

REGISTRATION AND TITLING OF LAND

4.3.1 Titling and Transfer

Section 49 (c) of the Land Act, Cap 227, states that the Uganda Land Commission shall procure certificates of title for any land vested in or acquired by the Government .According to paragraph 16.13.11 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 a government entity is considered to have control over land only when it has the title.

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, forty two (42) entities did not have land titles for a total of 4,398 pieces of land comprising twenty six (26) entities which had 1,638 pieces of land measuring approximately 80,038.88 hectares and sixteen (16) entities held 2,760 pieces with unknown land sizes. Appendix 7 refers. I noted that seven (7) entities which held 81 pieces of land measuring 12,521.1 hectares had land titles for all the pieces of land held as shown in the Table 10 below.

Table 10: showing entities with fully titled pieces of land

No	Entity	Pieces	Size (hectares)	
1.	Uganda Investment Authority	32	11,931.3	
2.	Soroti University	2	229.0	
3.	Kyambogo University	7	211.0	
4.	Butabika Hospital	3	77.0	
5.	Mandela National Stadium Ltd	3	50.2	
6.	Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development	31	21.0	
7.	Uganda Revenue Authority	3	1.6	
	Total	81	12,521.1	














The anomalies were attributed to the following; inadequate funds by the entities to process land titles and land having been donated by individuals who passed on without transferring title to the entity, delays by MZOs to effect registration and transfers, continuous acquisitions of land and delays in the survey process. Lack of Land titles results into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land.

Recommendations The Accounting Officers are advised to engage with MoFPED to secure funding to facilitate land titling, Ministry of Lands is advised to streamline and expedite process of titling public land.

4.3.2 Failure to transfer Land into the Custody of ULC

Section 49 of the Land Act Cap 227 further requires the Uganda Land Commission to hold and manage all the land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government including land acquired by the Government abroad. In addition, Instruction 16.13.11 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires the title of government land to be kept with the Uganda Land Commission.

I noted that out of the titled 1,909 land tittles held by 42 of the 45 MDAs in the sample, 15 MDAs did not transfer 167 land titles into the name and custody of the Uganda Land Commission for the benefit of the user MDAs. Appendix 8 refers.

The Accounting Officers of public Universities and URA explained that Universities were body corporate with a right to won and manage their own land. Failure to transfer all Government Land into the custody of ULC is irregular and affects the Government’s ability to effectively manage Public Land. The lack of a ULC specific legal framework to enable operationalise the mandate of the ULC as per the constitution and Land Act has also affected the effective management and administration of public land by the Commission.

Recommendations

- I advise the PPST to liaise with ULC to expedite the process of transferring land into the name and custody of ULC for the benefit of the user agencies. In addition, controls should be instituted to enable MDAs have oversight measures in ensuring their land is duly protected and not irregularly leased out.
- The PS Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development is advised to ensure that specific legal framework for the effective operation of ULC is in place.
- I advised the Attorney General to give a general guidance to corporate government entities in regard to the custody of entity land with ULC.











I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 20 entities did not record a total of 636 pieces of land measuring approximately 19,275.25 hectares in their respective Land registers rendering it difficult to confirm the completeness of their Land inventory. I also noted that 26 entities did not record a total of 1,355 pieces of land measuring approximately 21,603.08 hectares of land in their respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. Appendix 9 refers.

Whereas the Accounting Officers of MDA’s who did not record in the fixed asset register did not provide appropriate reasons for anomaly, I attributed the non-compliance to laxity on the part of management. The Accounting Officers for 13 sampled Local Authorities attributed the lack of updated land registers to the absence of a reconciled position between land acquired by the lower local governments and the districts. Failure to update the GFMIS was attributed to non-functionality of the GFMIS system and values of the land.

The non-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land which could easily lead to loss and /or misstatement of the non- produced asset in the financial statements.

Recommendation I advise the Accountant General to ensure that the asset module under the GFMIS is functioning properly. In addition, I advised the respective Accounting Officer to update both the fixed asset registers and the asset module under the GFMIS.

4.5

UTILIZATION OF GOVERNMENT LAND FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICE

4.5.1 Land utilisation

Section 34(1) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) 2015 entrusts Accounting Officers as Officers responsible for the management of the assets. Guideline 2.2.1 of the Asset Finance and Management Guidelines requires the PS/ST to promote and enforce transparent, efficient and effective management of assets. This is achieved through ensuring that the assets are maintained in an optimal operating condition and are not wasted through neglect and disrepair. In addition, guideline 2.2.4 requires Accounting Officers to effectively and efficiently utilize assets under their control for delivery of public services.











Recommendation I advise the PS/ST and the Accounting Officers to institute mechanisms to ensure that land utilisation plans are developed by entities. I further advised the PS/ST to address the funding deficits for land utilisation in MALGs. Meanwhile the Accounting Officers should ensure that the un-utilised land is protected against encroachments.

4.5.2 Encumbrance on Public Land

Instruction 16.13.12 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that to control an asset, a government entity should be the predominant user of the asset.

I noted that thirty four (34) entities had 434 pieces of land encroached upon, of these, 182 pieces measured approximately 61,207.04 hectares while 252 pieces had unknown measurements. Furthermore, of the 182 pieces, 96 pieces had a cost of 134.4Bn. Appendix 11 refers.

The anomaly were attributed to; Lack of titles and supporting documentation of ownership and prolonged non utilisation of land. Land encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the affected land for the intended purpose, and may pose a risk of loss of land.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officers to always ensure that all land held by the entities are free from all forms of encumbrances.

4.6

LEASE OF PUBLIC LAND

A review of 573 leases granted by nine (9) entities revealed the following anomalies; Appendix

12 refers.

4.6.1 Land Lease Register

Guideline 8.4.4 of the GoU Asset Management Framework and Guidelines, 2020 requires a schedule of land or any other asset disposed through a lease arrangement to be maintained in accordance with the approved format.

I noted that all the nine (9) entities with a total of 573 leases did not have updated lease registers for proper management of leases. This has led to increased litigation resulting from multiple allocation of leases; loss of land and revenue due to late or non billing for ground rent, and lease premiums; which impact on service delivery to the citizens. Details are summarised in the Table 11 below;

No	Entity	Un registered Leases		
		No of Pieces	Size (hectares)	
1	Uganda Land Commission	419	0	
2	Sironko DLG	123	0	
3	Uganda Broadcasting Corporation	10	5.789	
4	Uganda Railways	7	45.32

7	Makerere University	3	0	
8	Mandela National Stadium Ltd	2	22.433	
9	Gulu University	1	1.6	
	TOTAL	573	41.033	




The Accounting Officers of the local governments attributed the anomaly to the fact that leases were granted by former controlling Authorities that did not pass on inventory or lease records to the Boards for effective management. Whereas the Accounting officers of ULC and other MDAs acknowledged the observation, they explained that responsible officers had been trained in management information system which should track the leases.

Recommendation I advise the respective Accounting Officers of ULC, other MDAs and Local Governments to ensure that comprehensive lease registers are maintained for proper management of leased land.

4.6.2 Irregularities in Management of leased land

Regulation 6 of the Land Regulations, 2004 requires a lease offer made by a board or the commission to communicate the offer stating the terms and conditions of the offer conditioned upon payment of fees and other charges, in full or by instalment.

A review of a sample 573 leases granted the by the nine (9) entities revealed the following;

a) Sixteen (16) leases granted by six (6) entities had expired at the time of carrying out this audit. Details are shown in the table Below;

Table 12: Expired leases

6	Mandela National Stadium Ltd	2	22.433	
7	Gulu University	1	1.6	
	TOTAL	31	107.552	














Recommendation I advise the respective Accounting Officers of ULC, other MDAs and Local Governments to ensure that strong internal controls for effective management of leases are instituted.

4.7

Irregular allocation of Land by District Land Boards (DLB)

Regulation 23 (1) of the Land Regulations, 2004 on procedure in connection with allocation of land by the Board/Commission requires a person to apply to the Board/Commission to be allocated land in the district which is not owned by any person or authority. In addition Regulation 23 (2) of the Land Regulations, 2004 requires the Board/ Commission to advertise the application by giving notice in a newspaper with wide circulation to draw the attention of persons likely to be affected by the application, invite any person to comment on or object to the application and thereafter determine whether the applicant should be allocated the land for which the application is made

I noted that during the period under review 2 District Land Boards (DLBs) allocated 4 pieces of land which were not under their jurisdiction. The Table below refers.

Table 17: Irregular allocation of Land by District Land Boards (DLB)

No	Entity	Directorate	Irregular Land 4.7.1 Allocation by DLB		Causes

2	Gulu DLG	LA	2	Not stated	Lack of comprehensive database for Public Land by the DLB	
	Total		4			




1

The above anomaly was attributed to management override on internal controls such as non compliance with land allocation procedures. This may lead to litigation and loss of land which impacts on service delivery to the citizens.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officers to ensure strict adherence to the internal controls and compliance with land allocation procedures.











The Accounting Officer of ULC explained the Commission would engage MoFPED, MoFA, and other relevant government entities so as to provide the required information and resources to perform this component of their mandate.

Recommendation I advise the Accounting Officer to engage and liaise with other Government agencies to ensure that the provisions in the law in regard to management of government land abroad are fulfilled.

Appendix 2: METHODOLOGY i) Sampling At Entity Level

A combination of Stratified and Judgmental sampling was used to establish the number of Government Land and other sampling units for testing. The population of Government Land audited comprised of the total Land held by the entities as at the end of FY2021/22 from which an audit sample of Land to be audited will be generated. However, procedures on acquisition of Public Land, were applied on all Government Land acquired during the previous 4 financial years from 2018/19 – 2021/22. Where a sample of below 100% was drawn, a combination of Stratified and Judgmental sampling was used to establish the number of Government Land and other sampling units for testing.

ii) Data collection methods

Data was collected using the following methods.

- Interviews Interviews were conducted at entity level with staff that included Accounting Officers, Estates officers, Asset managers, Planners and Accountants to appreciate the Land management processes and activities.
- Review of documents Documents were also reviewed and these included; the GoU approved budgets and annual work plans, Land Management policies and guidelines, Asset registers, Land Titles, Land Valuation reports, Board of survey reports and the entity financial statements among others.
- Inspections Physical Inspections were also undertaken to verify existence, location and holders of entity Land.











iii) Data Analysis

The data collected was analysed to establish trends, patterns, variances, and other relationships so as to identify causes, draw conclusions and propose recommendations.

iv) Materiality

The matter under audit is quantitatively material considering the monetary value all Public Land. In addition, the concerns arising from encroachment and theft of government land make the matter qualitatively material as further described below:

a) Quantitative Materiality factors

Over the past four years from the FYR: 2017/18, 2018/2019, 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 Government has devoted a substantial amount of money on the purchase of Land. Based on the Consolidated Financial statements for this period; Government spent a total UGX. 2.48 trillion on Land purchases. In addition, government spent on average, UGX.620 billion.This implies that expenditure on purchase Land is quantitatively material.

b) Qualitative Materiality factors

- Significant increase in Land compensation claims and land related court cases against Government institutions makes the area qualitatively material.
- The public outcry on mismanagement and negative media coverage on Government Land makes the area qualitatively material.
