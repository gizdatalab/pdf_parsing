## THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

## Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 which comprise of the Statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 30 th June 2019, Statement of Comparative Budget and Actual Amounts, Statement of Cash flows, Statement of ADB Special Account Movement, Statement of ADB loan balances together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly in all material respects, the financial performance of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 and the Fund balances for the year ended 30 th June 2019, in accordance with the Project Funding guidelines and accounting policies stated in the notes to the financial statements.

## Basis of Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement’s section of my report. I am independent of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) project, ADF loan 2100150036246 in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

## 1. Overall Project Performance against the logical framework - Lack of an

**approved log frame for implementation of project activities**  
The Government of the Republic of Uganda (GoU) represented by Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) entered into a loan agreement not exceeding the equivalent of Ten Million Two Hundred and Ten Thousand Units of Account (UA 10,210,000), equivalent to USD Fourteen Million, Four Hundred Thousand ($14,400,000) with Africa Development Fund on 19 th January 2018, to finance all the foreign currency cost of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport Project. The Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) is the implementing Agency for the project at the Regional Level; while the Ministry of Works and Transport for Uganda is the National Executing Agency (NEA) at the National Level.

The overall project objective is to address the maritime transport and navigation safety challenges on Lake Victoria and contribute to the provision of safe, efficient transport links, and to safely conduct fishing activities that are essential to achieving the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development. The project is expected to further improve the quality of life for the people living within the Lake Victoria Basin, which is in line with the funder’s focus area.

Review of the Project documentation and strategy revealed that the Project did not have an approved log frame. The Project log frame as per good practice of Project implementation, would spell out the key activities of the Project over its life, the implementation timelines for each key activity, the estimated costs of the each key activity, expected key outputs and/or performance indicators and the monitoring and evaluation methodology of project activities. Management indicated that the consultant who was to carry out the project scoping at the regional level to enable formulation of a project log frame was yet to undertake the activity.

Without an approved project logical framework, evaluation of Project performance in terms of outputs, timelines and eventual achievement of the Project objectives will be difficult.

Management explained that due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there were delays in procuring a consultant to conduct project scoping (regional) so as to harmonize procurements and prepare log frameworks and BOQs for regionally procured items. Management further explained that the procurement has since then commenced and the consultancy should be implemented in the first quarter of the financial year 2020/2021, but this was still outstanding by the time of writing this report. Management further explained that, as a stopgap measure, the Partner states agreed that some of the regional activities be planned for and implemented nationally, for example procurement of nine rescue boats, one ambulance and one firefighting boat.

commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.  
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

## Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, ADB guidelines and the basis of accounting described in the notes to the financial statements, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Project’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246, and using the ADB Guidelines and Government of Uganda Regulations, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Project’s financial reporting process.

## Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

---

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Project’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246to fail to deliver its mandate.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

## Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with sections 19(1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements that;

Except for the matter raised in the compliance with legislation and funding requirements section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

## Report on Compliance with Legislation and Funding Requirements

The material finding in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matter is as follows;

## 2. Delayed Implementation of Project activities outputs

It was observed that at the National level, the Government of Uganda through Ministry of Works and Transport was implementing the project objectives through set target outputs. The target outputs at the start of the year and the level of achievement of the set targets at end of the year are as indicated in the table below and **Appendix I.**

From the table in **Appendix I,** I established that the loan disbursement and project implementation was at 7.9% compared to the overall project budget of USD$14,400,000 yet the Project was in its second year. There were therefore significant project delays that are likely to adversely affect implementation.

In the view of the Accounting Officer, the Project implementation delays have been caused by;

- Delays in the scoping exercise at the regional level.

- Delayed responses from member states on the consensus for Terms of Reference (ToRs) for Maritime Communication Network (MCN) submitted to LVBC;

- Different Standard Operating Procedures which have hindered regional project procurements and other community based activities;

- Absence of a committed Project Implementation Unit staff at the Regional Implementing Agency resulting in weak coordination at the LVBC;

- Engagement of the Regional Technical Committee and Regional Policy Steering Committee (RPSC) meetings in debates about the merit of having the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) vis a vis using the existing LVBC staff which resulted in arriving at divergent views of the participating countries;

- Absence of funds to implement regionally implemented activities that impact on the planned outputs in the member states, and;

- Un-envisaged project costs that were not detailed in Project Appraisal Report (PAR) that needed to be factored in the project as early as possible. For example; the costs for laying fiber optics to the remote areas where Marine Rescue

---

Communication Centre (MRCC) and Search and Rescue (SAR) center sites are located.

The overall project objective to address the maritime transport and navigation safety challenges on Lake Victoria may not be achieved under the circumstances.

Management agreed with the observation that there have been delays in project implementation, and further explained that the Republic of Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania have agreed to a commitment of implementation of the project “AS IS’ during the Mid Term Review (MTR).

Management further explained that action plans to quicken implementation with the Bank have been agreed upon, such as; the use of design and build consultancies to deliver procurements, for example African development Bank has given “no objection” for the Design and Build consultancy for the renovation and expansion of the Fisheries Training Institute. Management also indicated that among the Action plans for unlocking bottlenecks in the regional implementation, Lake Victoria Basin Commission was tasked to coordinate the meetings of the National Project Coordinators regularly.

I advised the Accounting Officer that;

- Participating Countries need to reiterate their commitment during Medium Term Report (MTR) that they will expeditiously ensure that the project administrative costs incurred by LVBCs are met.

- The meetings of the National Project Coordinators (PCs) should continue regularly to ensure that there is harmonization of nationally implemented activities with the view to ensure the interoperability of systems is being implemented in the three participating countries.

## Management Responsibility

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgment are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of internal control structure policies and procedures.

## Auditor’s Responsibility

My examination was made in accordance with ISSAIs and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, verification of assets and liabilities and such other auditing procedures I considered necessary in the circumstances.

For the purpose of this report, I classified the significant internal control structure policies and procedures in the following categories:-

- Control over preparation of withdrawal applications for funds from the project account
- Bank and cash Purchases and payments,
- Monitoring, evaluation and reporting.

For all the internal control structure categories listed above, I obtained an understanding of the design of the relevant policies and procedures and whether they have been placed in operation and I assessed control risk.
