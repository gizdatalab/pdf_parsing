He further explained that, Wii-Apaya Stream was an emergence activity which was unplanned for, and implemented under force account using Rural Transport Infrastructure (RTI) where the delay was as a result of the delay by the Ministry to respond to the request for the excavator and low bed. 11 100 1.72 100 17 13 04 03 86 Source: OAG analysis Bn Partial The",Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7,Unnamed: 8,Unnamed: 9,Unnamed: 10,Unnamed: 11,Unnamed: 12

The Accounting Officers are also expected to submit quarterly monitoring reports to OPM with a copy to the MoFPED for the attention of the Director Budget.
