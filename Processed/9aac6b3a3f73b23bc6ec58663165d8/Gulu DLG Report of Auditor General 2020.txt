REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GULU DISTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE, 2020

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of Gulu District Local Government,

which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as of 30 th June 2020, the Statement of

Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the Financial Statements of Gulu District Local Government for the year ended 30 th June 2020 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 as amended and the Financial Reporting

Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the District in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme

Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for

Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements

and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the Financial Statements of the current period. These matters

were addressed in the context of my audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in











partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.

A review of district’s approved work plans and budgets revealed that Gulu District had

an approved budget of UGX.42.4Bn, out of which UGX.30.1Bn was warranted/ availed by the end of the financial year. The total expenditure for the year was 27.3Bn out of

which UGX.18.04Bn 1 was spent on non-service delivery activities, such as employee

costs and transfers to other units (sub-counties, schools and health centres), implying

that only UGX.9.3Bn was available for implementation of service delivery outputs.

The UGX.9.3Bn that remained was applied for the implementation of one hundred and seventy three (173) outputs from which I sampled eleven (11) outputs with a budget of UGX.2.99Bn and expenditure of UGX.1.72Bn representing 18.5% of the total

resources spent on implementation of activities as shown in the table below.

The outbreak of the Covid Pandemic affected the implementation of the 2019/20 budget for a number of entities especially the implementation of activities in the last half of the financial year. A number of activities were not implemented as a result of budget cuts and the lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic.

No	Observation						Recommendation	
1.1	Implementation of the strategic plan Government has been implementing the NDP II, which ended at the end of financial year 2019/2020. In line with the NDP, the District had its strategic plan approved for the period 2015-2020; this plan set out both the long term and short term targets to be achieved.current audit year was the 5 th year /the last year of implementation of the strategic plan, and it is anticipated that all the projected targets would have been accomplished.noted that at the time of audit (June 2019/20), out of 6 strategic targets, the district had fully achieved two (2) targets and partially attained four (4) targets, as shown in the table below;extent of achievement of 2015/16-2019/2020 strategic plan by 2019/2020 No Level of performance by of 2019/2020the endNo of strategic goals/ objectivestotal of% of number strategic objectives 1 2 32 4 0 633.3 66.7 0 100Fully achieved Partially achieved Not achieved Total Source: OAG analysis The targets that were partially achieved were 1.Completion of Palaro Seed Secondary School. 2. Maintenance of district roads. 3. Emergency works Wii-Apaya Stream 4. Manual maintenance of 378.3km of District Roads The Accounting Officer attributed the underperformance to general reduction in the development sector grants under Education, Health and Water.ITheThe						advised the Accounting Officer to engage MoFPED and have the unimplemented activities rolled over for implementation in the subsequent periods.I	
								
								
								
								
								
								
1.2	Revenue Performance 1.2.1 Local Revenue (LR) Performance I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2019/2020 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX.1,294,588,000 during the year but collected UGX.1,259,040,473 representing (97%) performance. of UGX.35,547,527(3%) were recorded in Local Hotel Tax, interest from private entities and Park Fees. Revenue shortfalls affected the implementation of planned activities.The shortfalls in Local Revenue collectionsAccounting Officer attributed the revenue underperformance to outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.The						revisenoted the response and advised the Accounting Officer to always the budget with approval of council to reflect such unforeseen circumstance.I

Revenue shortfalls adversely affect the implementation of planned activities.

The Accounting Officer explained that the underperformance in other Government transfers was due to non-release/ or under-release of the various sources of revenue.

1.2.4 Performance from external financing

The District budgeted to receive UGX.3,254,000,000 as external/donor financing out I advised the of which UGX.752,730,825 (23%),was received as shown in the table below:

	Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities. The Accounting Officer attributed the revenue underperformance to outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.		
1.3	Absorption of funds Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.30,140,755,120 UGX.27,266,110,731 (90.5%) was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.2,874,644,389 (9.5%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.absorption of released funds results in non-implementation of planned activities and negates the purpose for which funds were disbursed. For example, the construction of the seed school at Palaro did not perform to the expected level and non-implementation of some sports activities due to Covid-19 pandemic.Accounting Officer attributed the under absorption of released funds to the COVID-19 outbreak that led to the lockdown and the failure of the district to fill a number of staffing position whose wage bill had been provided.UnderThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that funds for these activities are rolled over and subsequently ensure the speedy implementation of these activities.	
1.4	Off-budget receipts Section 36(6), 43 and 44(20) of the PFMA 2015, require all the public resources including external financing to be paid into the consolidated fund and once deposited shall form part of the consolidated fund and shall be availed through the Appropriations Act. Paragraph 24.6.2 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 also requires an Accounting Officer to ensure that all planned development partner disbursements under his or her vote are included in the vote budget estimates, i.e. appropriated by Parliament.6 of the Budget execution circular requires that all budgets irrespective of the source of financing (GoU/NTR, Donor or local government revenue) will be migrated and loaded onto the IFMS to facilitate budget implementation and reporting.I noted Gulu District did not receive any off-budget financing.Paragraph	I commend the Accounting Officer for adhering to the provisions of the law.	














1.5	Quantification of outputs/activities Paragraph 55 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the following quarter. These reports should clearly indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure.of the eleven (11) outputs with a total of seventeen (17) activities and expenditure of UGX.1.72Bn sampled for assessment, I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted that all the eleven (11) outputs with a total of seventeen (17) activities (100%) were fully quantified as shown in the table below.

1.6	Implementation 6 of Quantified outputs I assessed the implementation of eleven (11) out puts that were fully quantified with a total of seventeen (17) activities worth UGX.1.72Bn and noted the following. Eight (08) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities worth UGX 0.93 Bn were fully implemented. The entity implemented all the thirteen (13) activities (100%) within these outputs.  Three (03) outputs with a total of four (04) activities worth UGX 0.79 Bn were partially implemented by the time of the audit.										advised the Accounting Officer to address the issue of PBS with the relevant authority and always make on their communication/request to the Ministry.follow-upI

For example, the entity did not complete work on  Wii- Apaya stream  Palaro Seed Secondary School 33.4km of routine mechanized district roads as shown in Appendix 1Accounting Officer explained that failure to fully implement all planned activities and outputs was due to the use of Programme Budgeting System (PBS) where all the outputs are not quantified especially the non-standard outputs. He further explained that, Wii-Apaya Stream was an emergence activity which was unplanned for, and implemented under force account using Rural Transport Infrastructure (RTI) where the delay was as a result of the delay by the Ministry to respond to the request for the excavator and low bed.11 100 1.72 100 17 13 04 03 86 Source: OAG analysisBnPartialThe													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
													
Preparation 7 and submission of Monitoring plans and reports Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20 requires the Accounting Officer to prepare and submit annual monitoring plans for government programs and or projects under his/her vote to the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) with a copy to Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) and National Planning Authority (NPA) for harmonisation to ensure proper coordination to avoid duplication and fatigue. The Accounting Officers are also expected to submit quarterly monitoring reports to OPM with a copy to the MoFPED for the attention of the Director Budget. Contrary to this I noted that; The entity did not prepare and submit the annual monitoring plans to MoFPED, MoLG and NPA as required. The entity did not also submit quarterly monitoring reports to OPM and MoFPED as required.1.7												advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure compliance with the budget execution circular.I	
													














This practice is not only in contravention of the circular instructions but also hinders efforts of timely monitoring of the implementation of the budget.The Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly but explained that the quarterly monitoring of Government programmes was executed.									
Submission 8 of Quarterly Performance Reports Paragraph 55 of the BEC for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the following quarter.1.8noted that the entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 after the deadline given for submission of the reports as indicated in the table belowNo Details1 2 3 4Quarter One Quarter Two Quarter Three Quarter FourSource: OAG analysisDeadline for submission 31/10/2019 31/01/2020 30/04/2020 31/07/2020Actual date of submission 10/12/2019 01/02/2020 25/05/2020 Not submitted.yetCommentDelayed Delayed Delayed Delayedto submit performance reports in time not only contravenes the budget circular instructions, but also negatively affects the timely evaluation of performance and decision making.Accounting Officer explained that the delayed submission of performance reports was due to the upgrading the PBS which erased data that was input twice and the district experiencing system breakdown in the months of April to mid-June 2020 that contributed to the delay of the department to extract data to be used for reporting.IFailureThe								advised the Accounting Officer to always engage the PBS support of MOFPED timely resolution of system challenges.desk forI

These reports should clearly indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure.accuracy of performance could not be verified as the 4 th quarter performance report was not clear.Accounting officer explained that this was due to the delay in the approval of the fourth quarter report by the Budget Directorate at Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.TheThe								I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that the performance reports are clear and accurate.	
									














supplementary funding, the government encouraged citizens to make voluntary contributions to the State.

Because the response to the pandemic was emergent in nature, i.e. it was neither

anticipated nor planned for, there was a risk that the entities that participated in this intervention may experience challenges in optimally applying the availed resource to

address the effects of the pandemic. I, therefore, considered this as a key audit matter

and subsequently developed procedures to assess how entities managed the interventions and to satisfy myself that this was done in compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.

I specifically focused on; establishing how much funds were received, the extent of absorption of the funds, existence of approved work plans, compliance with PPDA legal

framework, the existence of proper accountability for the funds, ensuring that there

was accurate reporting among others. Based on the work performed I noted the

following;

1.2	Absorption and utilization of funds Out of the total receipts of UGX.252,500,000 (excluding non-cash donations) the entity absorbed UGX.212,500,000 representing absorption level of 84%. The balance of UGX 40,000,000 is part of the receipts from MPs whose cash limit was never given to the entity by the centre. The funds were spent as follows.No Details Amount (UGX) Percentage					I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up the UGX 40,000,000 that was retained by Treasury and ensure cash limits are obtained for the same.

The PS/ST also guided that all in-kind items received in-kind should be taken on charge, distributed with the approval of the Covid-19 task forces and appropriately accounted for.entity received in-kind donation (items) from a number of sources as shown in appendix IV. I noted the following from my review of how these were managed.All the items were valued as required by the Treasury Instructions I was therefore able to confirm the value of these donations in kind and the accuracy of the balances reported in the financial statements. All items were taken in charge by the entity staff as required by the treasury instructions.

From my inspection, I observed that the quarantine centre is well managed.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying my opinion, I draw attention to the following matters disclosed in

the Financial Statements:

3.0

Effects of the creation of Gulu City on the Assets and liabilities of Gulu District Local Government

The GOU upgraded Gulu MC to a City status with effect from 1 st July 2020. This

upgrade of the Municipal Council to City status extended the geographical area of

the city to include Laliya Sub-County and two parishes of Unyama Sub-county (Pakwelo and Unyama Parishes).

A review of the commentary by the Accounting Officer reflected that the District would relocate to Awach Sub-county implying reconstruction of new District Headquarter officer and incurring other administrative costs associated with the

relocation of District operating station.

The Accounting Officer further disclosed that the effects on other assets owned by the District within the new city are being discussed with the Ministry of Local Government(MoLG).

I await the outcome of this discussion and final guidance by GOU on this matter

4.0 Accumulated Payables

Included in the payables balance disclosed in Note 23 on page 31 of the financial

statements is UGX.1,470,813,483 which relates to sundry creditors(UGX.1,345,261,425) and trade creditors (UGX.125,562,058). These outstanding payables may lead to litigation costs for non and delayed settlements.











consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.

I have nothing to report in this regard.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and

Section 45 of the PFMA, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of Gulu District Local Government. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 and

the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing

the District’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

Auditor’s Responsibility

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as

a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an

auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,

but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect

a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAI’s, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for











financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s

report. However, future events or conditions may cause the District to fail to deliver its

mandate.

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant

deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that

were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and

are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless

law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare

circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because

the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on

my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised

in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

impediments and make recommendations for improvement. Specifically, the audit was

intended to ascertain whether government Vehicles were/are:

- Acquired in compliance with Government vehicle acquisition guidelines;

 Comprehensively recorded in the assets register to ensure their proper management;  Adequately allocated, operated and utilized to enable delivery of public service;  Properly and regularly maintained to achieve optimal performance, increased useful

lives and reduced running costs; and

 Disposed in compliance with PPDA guidelines, and disposal proceeds are properly

accounted for. The study took a scope of three financial years: 2017/18-2019/20. From the

procedures undertaken, I noted the following key observations;

	Key Observations	Audit Recommendation/ Comment	
4.1 4.1.1	the three financial years the District planned to spend UGX.50,000,000 on acquisition of vehicles from government funding. A sum of UGX.50,000,000 (100%) was warranted and released by the Treasury for the purpose and the District purchased 01 vehicle.ACQUISITION OF MOTOR VEHICLES FundingFor		
4.1.2	Compliance with Government Ban on Acquisition of Motor Vehicles According to the Circular letter Ref; BDP/86/107/03 and dated 15 th May 2019 from the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury to all Accounting Officers, Government issued a freeze order on purchase of vehicles by all MDAs during the FY 2019/20. Further guidance from the Ministry of Public Service (MoPS) through a Circular letter Ref; ADM 99/205/01 dated 21 st August 2019 indicated that clearance would only be given for procurement of vehicles under on-going donor funded projects.noted that the District acquired 01 motor vehicle at a cost of UGX.0.05bn during the FY 2019/20 using Government of Uganda funds with the necessary waiver from, the PS/ST.I	The Accounting Officer is commended for the good practice.	
4.1.3	Paragraph 8.6.2 of the Treasury Instructions (TIs), 2017 requires implementation of the budget to follow the work plans, procurement and recruitment plans approved by Parliament.

I noted that the 01 vehicle (100%) acquired at a total cost of UGX.50,000,000 was in line with the approved engine capacity recommended.Accounting Officer acknowledged the observation and promised to uphold good practice.The	I commended the Accounting officer for adhering to the set guidelines.	














4.2.0 4.2.1	Improper maintenance of Motor Vehicle Records Section 34 (2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 requires an Accounting Officer to keep a register of assets and inventory in the format prescribed by the Accountant General. Furthermore, Paragraph 16.6.1(e) & (f) of the TIs, 2017 requires recording of the acquisition cost and estimated useful life of the asset, which should assist in determining the time of replacement and depreciation cost of an asset.MOTOR VEHICLE RECORDINGFurthermore, Paragraph 10.13.4 of the Tis, 2017 requires all fixed assets acquisitions to be captured in the fixed assets module of the Government Computerised Financial Management Information System (GFMIS).I noted that out of 36 vehicles physically inspected, 35 vehicles (99.4%) were duly recorded in the assets register while one (1) vehicle (0.6%) acquired at a cost of UGX.50,000,000 was not recorded in the assets register.A total of 35 vehicles (99.4%) out of the 36 inspected were recorded in the format prescribed by the Accountant General which required capturing; date of purchase, type of vehicle, registration number, acquisition cost, estimated useful life, physical location, and condition. One (1) vehicle (0.4%) acquired at a total cost of UGX.50,000,000 was not recorded in the required format.the sampled 36 vehicles were traced to the staff or locations as recorded in the assets register which allowed traceability of vehicles.The Accounting Officer attributed the good performance to enforcement of the requirements in the Public Finance Management Act, and the Treasury Instructions.All	I commended the Accounting Officer for the good controls in place.	
4.3.0 4.3.1	MOTOR VEHICLE USAGEExistence of a fleet management policy and guidelines I noted that the District did not have a policy on Motor vehicle management to guide the usage and eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse of motor vehicles. This affects the entity’s ability to address its unique motor vehicle challenges which may not be envisaged in the standing Orders and Treasury Accounting Instructions.Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly and pledged to implement the audit recommendation.The	I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place a vehicle management policy streamlining usage of vehicles so as to eliminate wastage and of vehicles.misuse	
4.3.2	Vehicle allocation A review of motor vehicles allocation revealed that there were no officers allocated vehicles. Failure to allocate vehicles to officers may lead to irrational use of resources affecting service delivery.The Accounting Officer explained that the District has few motor vehicles which are shared among departments during implementation of programmes; which allocates vehicles to officers at UISE a challenge. Some vehicles sent to the District were attached to projects, and these projects are managed by designated officers who are not necessarily Heads of Departments.Motor	I advised the Accounting Officer to engage Ministry of Public Service on the revision the standing order in that regard.of	
4.3.3	Support to Entity Service Delivery A review of the vehicle allocation to key service centers in the District revealed that some departments or units were not adequately allocated vehicles as indicated in the table below;	I advised the Accounting Officer to always rationalize the allocation of vehicles in various departments/units of the District to ensurethe

VEHICLE MAINTENANCEAdequacy of Vehicle Maintenance Funding4.4.0noted that the District spent a total of UGX. 566,964,207 against the vehicle maintenance budget of UGX. 653,602,358 reflecting a funding shortfall to the tune of UGX.86,638,157 which is 13.3% of the budgeted vehicle maintenance funds as indicated in the table below;FY Vehicle Maintenance Budget (A)Amount spent (C)Variance (A-C)Average spending per vehicle (C/B)No. of operatio nal entity motor Vehicles (B) 2017/1 135 8 2018/1 9 2019/2 0140,654,070 118,820,513 880,152 21,833,557 266,115,597 137 241,916,982 1,765,817 24,198,615 246,832,691 138 206,226,712 1,494,396 40,605,979 Total 653,602,358 566,964,207 86,638,151The district’s annual average vehicle maintenance cost increased by 41% from UGX.880,152 in the FY 2017/18 to UGX.1,494,396. This increment may partly be caused by the aging number of the fleet as illustrated by the fewer number of vehicle replacements.Accounting Officer explained that the District has few vehicles. However, efforts were being made to provide for additional vehicles through local revenue budgets as the Ministry had banned purchase of new vehicles under the different funding.I4.4.1The											advised the Accounting Officer to devise strategies that would bring vehicle maintenance costs to manageable levels.I	
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												














6.0 Status of Basic Medical Equipment in HCIV

Medical Equipment represents a substantial asset in the health care delivery system;

including maternal care and it needs to be managed efficiently. Moreover, the way in

which it is purchased, managed and used can influence the quality of health care

delivered to patients. Medical equipment can also pose a risk to patients and staff, particularly if used improperly. In addition, routine/periodic and corrective

maintenance of medical equipment is key in achieving safe and cost-effective management of medical equipment.

It is against this background that the status of basic medical equipment for maternal

health was selected as an area of focus in the audit of financial year ending 30th June 2020.

Based on my audit I made the following observations;

7.0 Inadequate medical equipment at Awach Health Centre IV

Section 7.26 to 7.28 of Health Sector Service standards & Service delivery standards,

2016 defines the appropriate functional equipment and tools required for handling normal delivery, resuscitation of new born, and emergency care and resuscitation of mothers.

However, audit observed that the health facility had inadequate two medical

equipment fetoscopes and Blood Pressure machines while the rest are in excess.

S/n	Type of medical equipment	Recommended no	Available no	
1	Fetoscopes	10	9	
2	Episiotomy set	2	4	
3	Penguin sucker	5	10	
4	Ambubag–Adult	2	3	
5	Blood pressure machines (bp)	5	4	




Consequently, the health facility might not have been able to provide adequate screening and diagnostic services to the patients.

The Accounting Officer explained that the district was able to procure more equipment for the health facility. However, the reasons for excess procurement of some equipment and leave out inadequate equipment was not explained.

- Normal deliveries represented 89%
- Delivery by Caesarean represented 2.2%











in charge of the ward attributed the referral of mothers deliveries to lack of a blood bank at the health centre.

The HCIV is not in position to provide adequate maternal health services to the

community.

The Accounting Officer explained that blood transfusion services are now provided

and readily available at all times to patients that need it unless there is a stock out of the blood.

I commended the Accounting Officer’s efforts.

9.0 Follow up on UGIFT projects

During last year’s audit process, it was noted that the district had commenced

construction works on Palaro Seed Secondary School under the Education Sector. I carried out a follow-up audit on this project to assess;

 The level of implementation of the works against the approved contracts,

work plans and outputs;

 The usage, functionality and quality of the infrastructure works in the schools.

9.1 Delayed physical progress of the works

During the audit, I noted that the planned commencement date of works was 6 th July 2019 and completion date by 30 th June 2021 as per the Contract Agreement. A

review of the progress report revealed that planned works were behind schedule by 3 months as shown in photos below:-

9.2

Ineffective Internal control over certification of works for payments

I examined the interim payment certificates of M/s.Davich Company Ltd Contractor

to establish the availability of measurement sheets detailing the quantities and costs

in the payment certificates. I noted no inconsistencies and there was no delayed settlement of the certificates. The amount paid to the contractor was also found to

be commensurate with the works certified.

I commended the Accounting Officer for the effective internal control over works certification.

9.3 Contract supervision and monitoring; I reviewed the monthly progress reports and contract management file to ascertain

the extent of project supervision and monitoring and I noted that the reports defined

the scope of works, the progress of work in terms of physical, financial and

timeliness, an indicator that the progress reports are adequate. Additionally, there

were four sets of minutes of site meetings availed and weekly monitoring reports on the construction by the District Engineer.

The Accounting Officer attributed this good performance to the weekly supervision

and monitoring by the District team.

I commended the Accounting Officer and encouraged him to strengthen supervision and monitoring even more in order for the Contractor to deliver on time.

10.0 Under staffing

Uganda Public Service Standing Orders Chapter (A-a) paragraph 15(a) requires Permanent Secretary Ministry of Public Service to determine the terms and conditions of Service and the structures of the Public Service in consultation with the Secretary to the Treasury.

It was observed that out of the staff establishment of 233 employees, only

159(68%) posts were filled leaving a staffing gap of 74 (32%) as shown in
