These reports should clearly indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure. 4.5 of the two (2) outputs with a total of five (5) activities and expenditure of UGX.0.93Bn sampled for assessment I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted the following;  One (1) output with a total of three (3) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.304Bn were fully quantified. That is, all the three (3) activities (100%) within these outputs were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance.  One (1) output with a total of two (2) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.629Bn were insufficiently quantified.
