Further, without clearly and fully quantified outputs, I could not ascertain the level of achievement of these outputs and whether funds appropriated by both URC Board, Minister, and Parliament (for Government support) released to the Corporation were spent appropriately and the intended objectives achieved. explained that this was due to planning and budgeting gaps within the Corporation. The Planning Unit is in its infancy stage and inadequately staffed.

7,5.5 Implementation of quantified outputs assessed the implementation of Five (5) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of eighteen (18) activities worth UGX 0.507Bn and noted the following; The entity did not fully implement any output over the FY 2019/2020. One (1) output with a total of two (2) activities worth UGX 0.507Bn was partially implemented. The entity implemented both activities partially. Four (4) outputs with a total of sixteen (16) activities worth were not implemented at all. That is the entity did not implement all the sixteen (16) activities (0%) within the outputs. to Table 8 for a summary of the extent of implementation and amounts spent.
