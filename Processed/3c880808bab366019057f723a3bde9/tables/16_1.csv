,S/N,Key Observations,Audit Recommendation
0,12.1,"Improper maintenance of Motor Vehicle Records Corporation has a total of 48 locomotives of which only 11 locomotive engines were found in the asset register; some of these were in Uganda while the rest were in Kenya and Tanzania. noted however that there was no record of an inventory list for the locomotives maintained, their status of operation, engine capacities and location. Failure to maintain a complete asset register makes it hard for Management to follow up on all the locomotives which are the main source of revenue and operations for the Corporation. Accounting Officer explained that the maintenance records are generated by the workshop and they exist. However, the maintenance records were not availed for audit verification even after the Management response. I The The",of I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that an updated list all locomotives is maintained by the Corporation. I also advised the Accounting Officer to regularly make a status report after inspections are done.
1,12.2,"Failure to maintain Fuel Registers theft, losses, wastage and misuse of practice requires organizations to put in place measures to eliminate fleet. Furthermore, organizations are required to designate an officer to be in charge of transport matters, who shall among other duties, maintain a fuel register on all fleet and carry out monthly fuel reconciliation exercises. its was observed that whereas there was a designated officer responsible for URC transport matters, there were no fuel registers for the locomotives. to maintain registers for these locomotives makes the planning for the fuel needs difficult because the entity will not have a basis to guide it on how much fuel is used for different journeys and what can be done better to efficiently optimize its operations using the incurred costs. Best It Failure","to ensure I advised the Accounting Officer that individual fuel registers for all fleet are established, operationalized, and reconciliations undertaken for proper planning and maintenance."
