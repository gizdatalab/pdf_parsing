Accounting Officer gave the following reasons for the delays:  Following approval of reports by the Chief Government Valuer (CGV), UNRA undertakes the process of Identification, Verification and Disclosure (IVD) prior to effecting compensation payment. In this process, the PAPS are required to provide documents confirming ownership and identity and they are also disclosed to awards and only sign if they are satisfied with the award. Following IVD however, a number of issues arise that usually delay submission of PAP\u2019s files for payment include;  1\\. Lack of proper ownership documents, for example; sales agreements, letters of administration, and others.  2\\. Ownership disputes especially for untitled interests like Kibanja or customary land.  3\\. Absenteeism.  4\\. Rejection of compensation awards by PAPs that lead to review of the complaint to ascertain validity. \uf0b7 \uf0b7 UNRA has therefore adopted a process of negotiating with some PAPs for access prior to payment, where land is urgently required. As and when the PAPs are able to avail documents, or resolve disputes, payments are then made, subject to availability of funds. Furthermore, UNRA proactively engages the PAPs to aid quick resolution of disputes by arranging mediation meetings if cases are outside court or apply to have monies deposited in court pending determination of rightful owner by court.
