At chainage 16+900 – 17+015 in Kigorobya I village, PAP buildings that had been constructed beyond the road reserve mark post at 30 meters had been demolished but the land was not secured by UNRA and was still open to encroachment. Management explained that at chainage 17+100 in Kigorobya I village, Katana Catholic Church refused the road to traverse the Church compound and the road alignment had to be changed. Between chainage 4+200 - 4+500 along the Biiso loop, the design engineer realized that the Biiso link was joining the main stretch of Hoima - Wanseko at 90 degrees making a blind spot. This also necessitated realignment of Biiso loop to avoid the blind spot for road safety reasons.

It was established by UNRA that NHCC holds a freehold title over this public land but which title is registered in the names of Kireka Estates Limited. The land is also occupied by sitting tenants whom NHCC attempted to evict but was unsuccessful. UNRA initiated the census and socioeconomic survey of PAPs on this land, the sitting tenants disputed NHCC ownership of the land and claimed to be bona fide occupants on the land with an entitlement to compensation. to comply with a letter dated 30 th June 2021 (Ref. UNRA/DNPE/KJE-SG/6/21), UNRA sought the guidance of the Solicitor General on how to handle the compensation and resettlement in light of the challenges and disputes. In response to UNRA’s request, the Solicitor General advised that: - As per the loan agreement between Government of Uganda and African Development Bank for financing the KJE Project, the Government agreed the International Financial Corporation Performance Standards (IFC PS). According to the IFC PS 5 which is applicable to land acquisition and compensation of the Project Affected Persons, PAPs who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land or assets they occupy or use shall be offered resettlement housing with security of tenure and for those PAPs who own developments on the land before the eligibility cut-off date shall be compensated for the loss of the developments at full replacement cost. Therefore, all sitting tenants are eligible for compensation even though they have no legal entitlement as per the Laws of Uganda. When In",I await the Accounting Officer’s implementation of the guidance given by the Solicitor General.
