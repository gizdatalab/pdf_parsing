The incomplete titling was attributed to: PAPs having lost their titles and still processing special titles; titles held in court due to ongoing civil suits; titles held by absentee land lords whose whereabouts are not known. It was also noted that for both projects, there has been no progress in transfer of titles received. According to UNRA, transfer of titles had been put on hold as UNRA deliberates on whether to pay the taxes charged or seek for waiver from the MoFPED. The Accounting Officer explained that when UNRA attempted to transfer the titles to UNRA names in 2019, they were advised to pay stamp duty which was a sum that had not been budgeted for and as such could not have title transfers done. Considering the budget implications in light of the number of titles to be transferred, UNRA was therefore advised to seek a waiver from PS/ST and if not possible request for the budget line accordingly and this is to be pursued by Management within this year.", , , ,
