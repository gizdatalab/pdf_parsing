The Accounting Officer explained that the unit cost is provided for in the work plan, where we indicate the expected output and total cost, by inference the unit cost is obtainable and this is per the template of the budget system.",Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7,Unnamed: 8,Unnamed: 9,Unnamed: 10
