1,4.1.1,"Public Legal Notification and Gazette of Land for Public Use Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act CAP 226, 1965 requires that after the publication of a declaration in respect of any land, the assessment officer shall cause a notice to be published in the Gazette and exhibited at convenient places on or near the land. A copy of the published notice is also served on the registered proprietor of the land. The notice shall indicate a day when all persons having an interest in the land should appear personally or by agent before the assessment officer. I noted that for the Hoima-Butiaba-Wanseko Road Project, UNRA did not submit a request to the Ministry of Lands to declare the land identified for the road project as land of interest. It was also noted that there was no evidence that the assessorâ€™s notice for the project was published in the Gazette, contrary to the Act. This could have been an oversight by Management. As a result, some PAPs proceeded to sell their land or process titles on the project land. This is likely to emanate into PAP grievances, court battles and/or escalated entitlements. The Accounting Officer explained that a Request to Gazette the Hoima Butiaba road was made to Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD) as procedurally required in January 2020.However, the gazette instrument did not come through and the UNRA Legal team is following up on the same along with other new submissions. I noted that although the request to Gazette was made to MLHUD in January 2020, this was about five years after the first valuation report had",I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that the assessment officer causes a notice to be published in the Gazette and exhibited at convenient places on or near any land immediately after the publication of a declaration that the land is required by the Government for a public purpose.
