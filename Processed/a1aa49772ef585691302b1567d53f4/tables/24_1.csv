0,"PAPs who were compensated was due to COVID-19 restrictions that inhibited ability of the PAPs to resettle themselves outside of the right of way.. Subsequently, there were a number of requests for grace periods by PAPs which could not be ignored by UNRA given the challenges that Covid 19 presented to people, PAPs being no exception. However, all the PAPs falling in this category are being followed up and are all expected to vacate the ROW by the end of year 2021.", , 
1,4.4.3,"Demarcation of acquired land According to the GCALA, 2017 the acquiring entity is required to demarcate the required project area using clearly identified erected markers and geo- reference these in the presence of local authorities and representatives. In line with this, Section 5.9.2.1 of the UNRA LARP 2019 states that as soon as possible and in any case not later than one month after the clearing of the right of way, the cleared right of way shall be demarcated by pillars and/or trees and the enforcement team shall be tasked to patrol the areas actively to avoid intruders. However, out of the 20 villages in the KJE Project area where inspected properties were located, it was noted that only 8 villages had clearly identified markers, demarcating the acquired right of way. In the remaining 12 villages, there were no signs of demarcation of the right of way on properties that had been fully paid for and acquired. The failure to clearly demarcate the right of way leaves the acquired land open to encroachment. The Accounting Officer explained that the installation of Marker Posts to demarcate the extent of the UNRA ROW is being done progressively after the PAPs have vacated the site and the Right of Way cleared. The plan is to demarcate the entire right of way after its fully compensated and cleared and all areas that are not yet demarcated shall also have the marker stones installed in due course. The land acquisition team is working closely with enforcement team to secure the acquired Right of Way.",I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the acquired sections of the project area are demarcated with clearly identified erected markers.
2,4.4.4,"Access of the Right of Way on Hoima-Wanseko Project Through inspection of the whole road stretch from Kilometre 00+00 to 93+400 and the two T offs to Biiso and Butiaba, I established that the contractor had obtained full access to the land traversing these kilometres of the road. Full access for the carriage way had been obtained and the road works were completed in most of the road sections save for the T off to Butiaba. It was further established that the contractor had also erected mark posts on both sides along the stretch of the road to mark off the limits of the road reserve. Management of UNRA credited this to the negotiations that were made earlier with the communities and sensitization made to them about the benefits of having the road and the developments that it would bring to the communities.",I commend the Accounting Officer for having ensured the contractor obtains the right of way to expedite the construction works.
3,4.4.5,Wasteful expenditure The inspection of the entire road stretch from Hoima to Wanseko fishing village revealed that 14 PAPs on the right hand side of the road between chainage 16+900 – 17+015 along the main stretch and chainage 4+200 –,"I advised the Accounting Officer to have the land titled, secured and clearly marked off"
