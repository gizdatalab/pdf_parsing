##### REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FORT PORTAL REGIONAL REFERRAL HOSPITAL

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022**

##### THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

##### Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital for the year ended 30 th June 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

##### Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

##### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

I have determined the matters described below as the key audit matters to be communicated in my report.

##### 1.0 Payroll Management

Over the years, Government has implemented several reforms in payroll management including the decentralization of salary, pension and gratuity payments. Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the payroll management in the Central Governments.

During my audit of the previous financial year (2020/21), I undertook a comprehensive audit of payroll management in the Ministries, Departments and Local Governments, which revealed major challenges. The audit findings and my recommendations thereof are still being considered by various stakeholders.

---

In view of the previous year’s audit observations and the significance of the payroll to the overall Hospital budget (refer to table below), I again considered management of payroll in MDALGs with emphasis on payments and deductions as a Key Audit Matter to be communicated in my report.

During the year under review (FY 2021/22), the Referral Hospital spent, UGX.7,313,161,543 on Salaries, Pension and Gratuity, representing 69.7% of the total expenditure of UGX.10,490,554,110 as detailed below;

| **Account code** | **Particulars** | **Amount (UGX)** |  
|---|---|---|  
| 211101 | General Staff Salaries | 6,255,781,452 |  
| 212102 | Pension for General Civil Service | 580,751,550 |  
| 213004 | Gratuity Expenses | 476,628,541 |  
|| **Total** | **7,313,161,543** |  


I designed audit procedures to ascertain whether;

- Funds for salaries, pension and gratuity were released and utilized as budgeted.
- Only eligible employees, pensioners and beneficiaries accessed the payrolls and were paid accordingly.
- Correct deductions were made from salaries and remitted to the rightful beneficiary institutions.
- The Referral Hospital complied with the established payroll management controls
- All salary, gratuity and pension transactions were correctly disclosed in the financial statements.

Based on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;

However due to enhancement of lunch allowance, the recruitment couldn’t be done immediately as wage analysis showed deficit. Supplementary wage was requested for but was received in the last month of the financial year. Furthermore, some gratuity files were not finalised due to validation issues. One planned file was not paid due to lack of letters of Administration. They have currently been processed and file is under process. T Under |<|<|<|<|<|<|<||

By the entities have to charge expenditure to the appropriate code during budgeting and execution. noted that funds amounting to UGX.33,040,090 relating to Pension and Pension Arrears were charged on account codes other than those prescribed for Pension and Pension Arrears as shown in the **table below:** **S/ N** **Description of misclassificati on** **Amount misclassifie d** **Effect** on Financial Statements** **1**  Pension **Account Code and descriptio n charged** **as** per IFMS** 213004 – Gratuity Expenses **Correct code and descriptio n as per Chart of Accounts** 321608 Pension arrears (Budgeting  ) -  33,040,090  of Overstatemen t  expenditure and overstatement of payables **Total** 33,040,090** a result, the financial statements do not show the true nature of transactions of the Referral Hospital and could mislead users of the financial statements. he Accounting Officer explained that there were no funds for payment of pension arrears as computed and automated by Ministry of Public service.

The Act also prescribes the rates of LST in respect of persons in gainful employment and earning a monthly take-home salary. analysis of the IPPS register and re-computation of LST revealed the following;  LST was not deducted from 25 employees leading to non- collection of UGX.2,140,000 on the payroll.   The Hospital had wrongly deducted the LST of 319 employees resulting into an over deduction of UGX.1,165,000 and under deduction of UGX.8,266,250. deduction of LST leads to financial loss to the Hospital and its employees. he Accounting Officer explained that they had no control over this issue since the calculation of the local Service tax was meant to be automated on the IPPS system.

##### Other Matter

I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements:

**2.0**

##### Implementation of approved budget

##### 2.1.1 Overall Revenue Performance

Out of budgeted total revenue of UGX.11,044,995,497 for the year 2021/2022, only UGX.10,999,510,621 (99.6%) was realized.

The performance of each revenue source is summarized in the table below:

---

| **Revenue Source** | **Approved Budget** | **warrants** | **Variance** | **% funding** |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| Local Revenue | 450,000,000 | 408,115,125 | 41,884,875 | 90.7 |  
| Central Government grants | 10,594,995,497 | 10,591,395,496 | 3,600,001 | 99.96 |  
| **Total** | **11,044,995,497** | **10,999,510,621** | **45,484,876** | **99.6** |  


Some items of the budget were not implemented for example the enhancement of wages for private wing staff.

The Accounting Officer explained that the underperformance of non-tax revenue was attributed to delays in replenishment of stocks of medicines and medical supplies at the private wing due to delayed release of funds by MOFPED and this affected the planned increase of salaries for staff at the private wing.

I advised the Accounting Officer to come up with measures to improve NTR collections at the private wing.

##### 2.1.2 Absorption of funds

Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.10,999,510,621, only UGX.10,490,661,110 (95%) was spent by the entity resulting into unutilised funds of UGX.508,849,511 (5%).

The funds that were not absorbed were meant for the following key activities which were subsequently partially or not implemented at all.

| **S/n** | **Activity** | **Amount-Unspent** |  
|---|---|---|  
| **1** | Purchase of medical equipment | 48,400,000 |  
| **2** | Wage | 306,742,378 |  
| **3** | Welfare | 76,727,825 |  
| **4** | Gratuity | 107,222,607 |  


Failure to absorb funds negatively affected Health service delivery to Citizens as well as livelihoods of the pensioners.

The Accounting Officer explained the causes of under absorption as detailed in the table below;

| **No** | **Activity** | **Amount- Unspent** | **Reason/Attribution** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| **1** | Purchase of medical equipment | 48,400,000 | There was delay in delivery of some equipment by the supplier before the close of the financial year. The supplier claimed to have ordered for the items from abroad but could not arrive in time for payments to be made. The funds were swept back. |  
| **2** | Wage | 306,742,378 | There was no recruitment done since the entity had received the supplementary for wage in last month of the year. |  
| **3** | Welfare | 76,727,825 | This was a supplementary for feeding Covid 19 patients and staff. This time Covid19 cases had reduced and the funds could not be utilized. |  
| **4** | Gratuity | 107,222,607 | There were no pending gratuity files to pay. |  


---

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure timely commencement of recruitment processes. In addition, the Accounting Officer should ensure that the Human Resource department supports prospective pensioners in preparation and submission of required documentation to access their pension benefits.

**3.0**

##### Lack of an Approved Work plan and Budget in the Private Wing

Section 3 (1) of Ministry of Health guidelines for management of private wings of health units in Uganda 2003, requires a private wing to develop comprehensive strategic plans spanning a period of 3-5 years. Annual slices of these plans will be developed every year as annual work plans or operational plans.

Section 4.3.1 (Budgeting), of the same guidelines stipulates that a private wing budget should be made for every financial year and all expenditures will be based on this budget. This budget should mirror the different ledger categories/accounts making it easy to do budget monitoring and making of financial reports related to the budget.

Contrary to the guidelines, the Hospital private wing didn’t have an approved work plan and budget for the financial year 2021/2022.

In the absence of a work plan and budget, there is a risk of abuse of Non Tax Revenue collected by the private wing.

The Accounting Officer responded that when doing planning and budgeting for the hospital, non-tax revenue from the private wing is always incorporated in the main hospital budget and work plan. For the year under review, this was the case as well. However, management of the hospital deliberately decided to constitute a team of staff to develop the private wing policy, budget and work plan to guide the operations and general management of the private wing. The private wing policy, budget, and work plan is now available for the current year.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the private wing has a budget and work plans in place.

**4.0**

##### Outstanding Receivables at the private wing

Paragraph 4.0 of the Guidelines of management of Private wings of health units in Uganda, 2010 provides that private wings should be managed like business enterprises with clear separate transactions and identification of resource exchange between itself and the rest of the hospital.

A review of the expenditure vouchers revealed that hospital management and board members consumed hospital services worth UGX.17,656,100 and only paid UGX.2,347,000 leaving a balance of UGX.15,209,100.

Failure by staff to meet the medical bills results into loss revenue for the private wing and is a loss to Government.

The Accounting Officer explained that there were services and medicines prescribed for staff and these were not provided/supplied by the National Medical Stores since they were not on the essential drugs list of Government. The understanding was that this cost would be incurred by the hospital from the vote of staff health cost or

---

welfare vote. However, the budgetary provision for such activities were always insufficient. However, management pledged to pay as and when resources were made available.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the services offered are fully paid for.

##### Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The Other Information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

##### M anagement’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the PFMA, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital (RRH).

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters affecting ability to deliver its mandate for the foreseeable future, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

##### Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAI’s, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for

---

my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the RRH’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on RRH’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the RRH to fail to deliver its mandate.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

##### Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

##### Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

**5.0**

##### Expired advance payment security

---

Regulation 47(4) (C) of PPDA (Contract) regulations, 2014 states that A payment security shall be valid for a prescribed period beyond the expected final date of completion of a contract or expected release date.

Contrary to the above, advance payment of UGX.215,265,000 was made to Prutaz Construction and vocational training Ltd in the contract for construction of a perimeter wall fence against an advance payment guarantee that was expiring on 19 th September 2022 yet the contract period had been extended to 2 nd December 2022.

Furthermore; the contract manager in his letter to the contractor stated that the contractor should furnish the PDU with an advance payment guarantee that is extended till the intended completion date 2 nd December 2022.

This exposes the PDE to risk of loss of funds in case the contractor fails to meet their obligations.

The Accounting Officer explained that the contractor had executed over 80% of the works. However, full recovery of the advance payment would be made in line with the contract agreement. There had been a general delay in completion of the works and this had called for contract extensions to enable the work to be completed. The contractor was expected to extend the advance payment guarantee up to May 2023 when the contract would be expected to be completed.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the contractor furnishes Referral Hospital with an advance guarantee that is valid till the completion date of the works.
