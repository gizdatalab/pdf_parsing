REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF KAMPALA CAPITAL CITY AUTHORITY

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2020

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Kampala Capital City Authority

(KCCA) which comprise the statement of Financial Position as of 30 th June 2020, the Statement

of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kampala Capital City Authority as of 30 th June 2020 and its financial performance

and cash flows for the period then ended, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, KCCA Act 2010 and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).

Basis of Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions

(ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s

Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement’s section of my report. I am independent of the Authority in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), the

International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics and other

independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in

accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matters











quantification of outputs, partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.

The Authority is mandated under the Kampala Capital City Act 2010, to facilitate the delivery of quality services to the people in Uganda’s Capital City-Kampala.

To achieve this mandate, the Authority planned to implement a number of both recurrent and development deliverables under various programmes. A review of the

entity’s ministerial statement and budgets revealed that the Authority had an approved

budget of UGX.304,375,682,976 out of which UGX.295,805,031,954 was released. The table below shows a summary of the key deliverables of the Authority for the financial

year 2019/20.

7	070807-Primary education (wage)	10.1	68	




The Authority planned to achieve its deliverables through the implementation of fifty

(50) outputs with a budget of UGX 304.35Bn I sampled forty-eight (48) outputs with a budget of UGX.244Bn, representing 60% of the total budget for review.

The outbreak of the Covid-19 Pandemic affected the implementation of the 2019/20 budget, especially activities in the last half of the financial year. As a result, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic.

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following:

No	Observation	Recommendation	
1.1	Implementation of the strategic planoverall Government National Development Plan (NDP II) expired at the end of FY 2019/20. In line with the NDP II, the Kampala Capital City Authority had an approved strategic plan for the period 2015/16 - 2019/20, which set out both the long term and short term targets to be achieved during the duration of the strategic plan.being the last year of implementation of the Authority’s strategic plan, I undertook an assessment of the achievement of the Authority’s’ strategic targets/goals.noted that the Authority had planned to implement six strategic targets/goals which were all partially implemented by 2019/20.to fully achieve strategic plan objectives implies that the intended beneficiaries did not get services as envisioned at the beginning of theIThe ThisFailure	I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the Authority has adequate mitigation measures against such challenges during the subsequent planning period to realise better results.in order

Out of this, UGX78.4bn was collected, representing a performance of 89.8% of the target.in NTR collections affect the implementation of planned activities at the Government-wide level.explained that the supplementary property valuation in the divisions, rolling out the newly developed Computer Aided Mass Valuation system and undertaking enforcement activities to recover revenue arrears have been adopted in a bid to ensure realization of the projected revenue.strategies such as finalizingof GoU receiptsentity budgeted to receive UGX.304.4Bn out of which UGX295.8Bn was warranted representing 97.2% performance.shortfalls affect implementation of planned activities.Revenue Performance-for MDAs Performance of NTRI Shortfalls ManagementPerformance TheRevenue	I await the outcomes of the interventions by the Accounting Officer for recovering uncollected revenue.also advised the Accounting Officer to engage MoFPED so that in future funds are released as appropriated.I	
1.3	Under absorption of fundsof the total receipts for the financial year of UGX295.8Bn, UGX.288.7Bn was spent by the Authority resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.7.1Bn representing an absorption level of 97.6%. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund accountunder absorption of released funds was caused by unspent salary funds due to delay in recruitment, delayed constructions due to COVID-19 -19, among others.absorption of released funds results in non-implementation of planned activities. The unimplemented activities include;Implementation of the urban tourism strategic plan in Kampala  Phase II of the fencing of Kisaasi Primary School  Monitoring of groups youth groups  Disbursement of CDD funds to community groupsAccounting Officer explained that the under absorption was due to failure to implement some activities as result of Covid measures instituted to curb the spread of CoVID-19.OutThe UnderThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoFPED for funds to be availed so that these activities are implemented in the subsequent period.

Paragraph 24.6.2 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 also requires an Accounting Officer to ensure that all planned development partner disbursements under his or her vote are included in the vote budget estimates, i.e. appropriated by Parliament.noted the Authority received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX. 13,138,106,449 which was not appropriated by parliament as required by the law. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for.financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities and is also contrary to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) 2015.Accounting Officer explained that all efforts were made by Management to include the budgets for the entire Off budget funding in the budget process of FY 2019/20 when government provided a platform in the PBS system. However, these budgets were not consolidated and presented by MOFPED to parliament and hence were not appropriated.IOff-budgetThe	expenditure of such funds the government financial system.follows	
1.5	Quantification of outputs/activities55 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the next quarter. These reports should indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure.of the forty-eight (48) outputs with a total of ninety-eight (98) activities and expenditure of UGX.182.109Bn sampled for assessment I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted the following; Twenty-six (26) outputs with a total of fifty-eight (58) activities and expenditure worth UGX.133.540Bn were fully quantified. That is, all the fifty-eight (58) activities (100%) within these out-puts were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance.Four (4) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities, and expenditure worth UGX12.763Bn were insufficiently quantified. I observed that out of the Thirteen (13) activities, four (4) activities (30.8%) were quantified while seven (7) activities (69.2%) were not clearly quantified to enable assessment of performanceEighteen (18) outputs with a total of twenty-seven (27) activities and expenditure worth UGX 35.805Bn were not quantified at all. That is, all the twenty-seven (27) activities (0%) within these outputs were not clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance. Details in Appendix I.ParagraphOut	I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that even with the transition to programme-based budgeting, quantification of activities and out puts is emphasized.

1.7 Preparation and submission of Monitoring Reports plans and reports58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20 requires the Accounting officer to prepare and submit annual monitoring plans for government programs and or projects under his/her vote to the Office of the Prime Minister with a copy to Ministry of Finance, and National Planning Authority for harmonization to ensure proper coordination to avoid duplication and fatigue. The accounting Officers are also expected to submit quarterly monitoring reports to the office of the prime minister with a copy to the Ministry of Finance for the attention of the director budget.to this I noted that; The Authority did not prepare and submit the annual monitoring plansParagraphContrary												The Accounting Officer’s explanation is noted.await the outcome of the Accounting Officers actions.I

1.8 Submission of Quarterly Performance Reports55 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the following quarter.noted that the entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 within the deadline given for submission of the reports as indicated in the table belowNo Details Deadline submissionfor The actual date of submissionComment (submitted time/ delayed) Submitted in timein Quarter One 31/10/2019 31/10/2019 Quarter Two 31/01/2020 31/01/2020 Submitted in timeQuarter 30/04/2020 30/04/2020 Submitted in time Three Quarter Four 31/07/2020 31/07/2020 Submitted in time1.9 Accuracy of Performance reports submitted55 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2019/2020 states that the Accounting Officer is required to submit quarterly performance reports by the 30 th day of the first month of the following quarter. These reports should clearly indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure.my review of the Annual cumulative performance reports and physical inspections/verification of performance and financial statements, I noted inconsistencies in the reported performance, as shown in the table below.No Activity details Level of performance reported by the entityLevel of performance as verified by the audit team Review of BIG report indicated expenditure of UGX.13,368,246,771Variance (UGX)Management 4,404,229 expenditure UGX.13,372,651,000reported ofSub Programme:02 Legal services - Output: 40 Communications and Public Relations strategies Sub Programme:02 Legal services - Output: 41 Policy, Planning and Legal Services 07 Engineering and Technical Services Output: 02 Urban Road MaintenanceManagement expenditure UGX.5,521,425,000reported ofReview of BIG report indicated expenditure of UGX.5,500,343,28021,081,720Management expenditure UGX.150,000,000reported ofReview of BIG report indicated expenditure of 300,000,000150,000,000175,485,949I1 2 3 4234ParagraphParagraphFrom											I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the budget execution circularI advised the Accounting to engage MoFPED for support and build capacity of KCCA staff in the use of the PBS tool.	
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												














This is an indication of a disjoint between the financial reporting and budgeting systems.

The Accounting Officer explained that this was caused by the difference in timing of the extraction of the reports and eventual transfer/input into the

budgeting tool. The IFMS system sometimes posts transaction earlier

identified in transit to the actual item. This will cause differences. KCCA will get a cut off to ensure alignment of the balances reported.

2.0

Management of Covid-19 interventions

Government of Uganda instituted a number of interventions to respond to the Covid 19 outbreak. Key among these included supplementary funding to enable the entities respond to the threat and effects of the pandemic on Ugandans. In addition to the

supplementary funding, the government encouraged citizens to make voluntary contributions to the State.

Because the response to the pandemic was emergent in nature, i.e. it was neither

anticipated nor planned for, there was a risk that the entities that participated in this intervention may experience challenges in optimally applying the availed resource to

address the effects of the pandemic. I, therefore, considered this as a key audit matter

and subsequently developed procedures to assess how entities managed the interventions and to satisfy myself that this was done in compliance with the applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.

I specifically focused on; establishing how much funds were received, the extent of absorption of the funds, existence of approved work plans, compliance with PPDA legal

framework, the existence of proper accountability for the funds, ensuring that there was accurate reporting among others.

Based on the work performed I noted the following;

2.2	Absorption of funds receivedof the UGX.1,000,000,000 received by the Authority, UGX.1,000,000,000 was spent representing an absorption rate of 100%.

2.3 Quantification and implementation of activitiesobserved that although the Authority prepared a work plan, the work plan was not sufficiently quantified. None of the 6 planned activities was fully quantified to facilitate measurement of performance.the circumstances, I was unable to ascertain the extent to which these activities were implemented since there were no clearly measurable targets.Accounting Officer explained that this activity was an emergency that cropped in the middle of the financial year. An emergency budget and work plans were made and submitted and relevant approvals were obtained from Parliamentary Committee on budget after presentation of the KCCA estimates.IInThe									inI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the future all activities in the work plans are fully quantified to facilitate performance measurement.

2.5 Valuation of in-Kind donations received15.5.1 of the Treasury Instructions states that inventories are accounted for by value as well as by quantity, and it is necessary for an Accounting Officer to keep records so as to determine the unit cost of each inventory item and the reconciliation of the total value of the stocks of inventories with the financial records.to the above, I observed that all items received in-kind by the entity were not valued. I was, therefore, unable to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the information pertaining to receipts reported by the entity.The Accounting Officer explained that it was difficult to assign values to the items donated in kind as the Donors didn’t attached values to these items.ParagraphContrary									futureI advised the Accounting Officer to in make reference for acceptable price source such as PPDA prices common user items, average market prices or seek the help of the chief government valuer to have such items valued.for	
										
2.6 Recording/taking on charge items receivedIn his guidance dated 16 th April 2020 to all Accounting Officers,									I await the outcome of the Accounting Officers actions.	
										














	the PSST guided that all Accounting Officers should formally acknowledge all donations in kind and ensure that they are recorded, taken on charge and reported in line with the laid down procedures stipulated in the Treasury Instructions 2017. In addition, guideline 1 (B) of the guidelines for management of Covid-19 response fund donations issued on 28 th April 2020 by the PSST states that donations in kind at the Local Governments shall be recorded and taken on charge in accordance with chapter 15 of the Treasury instructions 2017.noted that KCCA received and distributed/used in-kind donations without taking then on charge, which is contrary to the guidelines given and the Treasury Accounting Instructions.Failure to take items on charge exposes the items to the risk of misuse and complicates the exercise of the verification and confirmation of the utilisation of these items.Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly and committed to updating all records that will be received future to minimise risk of misuse.IThe		
2.7	Distribution of in-kind donations2 (B) of the guidelines to all Accounting Officers for management of Covid-19 response fund donations issued on 28 th April 2020 by the PSST states that the distribution of in- kind donations shall be guided by the District Covid-19 Taskforce.By the time of writing this report, some of the items that had been received as in-kind donations had been distributed. I was however not provided evidence that: The Authority obtained the approval of the district Covid-19 task force to distribute the items.  There was satisfactory accountability for the distributed items.As such, I was unable of confirm whether the items were distributed to the intended beneficiaries.Accounting Officer explained is committed to comply with guidelines issued by PSST and to ensure all inventories are accounted for. Accounting Officer further stated that the majority of the items received were medical in nature and distributed to the health facilities captured in the facility stock cards.that Managementthe time of writing this report, this evidence had not been availed.GuidelineTheBy	I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that distribution of such items is well documented and supported.	














3.0 Outstanding receivables

Paragraph 9.1.2 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 state that where an Accounting

Officer is designated as a receiver of revenue, he or she shall be personally responsible

for ensuring that; (b) all revenue invoiced is paid, (d) adequate safeguards exist and are applied for prompt collection, depositing, reporting and accounting for all government revenue.

My analysis of the trade receivable figure reported in the Authority's financial statements revealed that the uncollected revenue at the end of the financial year stood

at UGX 103,567,655,299. Interviews carried with management further revealed that;

 UGX 3,793,224,070 (3.6% of the total revenue balance) relating to advertising was

not collectable due to a court ruling that outlawed this source of revenue.

 UGX 8,464,801,603 (8% of the balance) is also unlikely to be realized since it relates to MDAs that have overtime refused to honor their obligations.

There is, therefore, a risk that the receivables balance reported in the financial

statements are overstated.

The Accounting Office explained that whereas it is true that court, in April 2020, ruled

against collection of outdoor advertising fees hence casting doubt on the collectability of the outstanding outdoor advertising fees, they were not satisfied with the ruling and an appeal against it is being pursued. She further stated that Efforts of recovery of the outstanding property rates owed by the MDAs are being pursued through intense

engagements with each of the relevant MDAs’ Accounting Officers.

I await the outcome of the court processes regarding the receivables from outdoor

advertising and the engagement with the Accounting Officers of the entities with outstanding property rates.

4.0

Management of domestic arrears

4.1 Outstanding Long-term payables

I noted that the Authority has a long term liability of UGX.42,570,448,999 on its

balance sheet. This arose from development credit agreement between IDA and KCC











4.2

Accumulation of domestic arrears

Section 21(2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 states that a vote shall not

take any credit from any local company or body unless it has no unpaid domestic arrears from debts in the previous financial year, and it has the capacity to pay the expenditure from the approved estimates as appropriated by parliament for that financial year.

Further paragraph 10.10.17 of the Treasury Accounting Instructions 2017 requires the Accounting Officer to ensure that no payments due in any financial year remain unpaid

at the end of that year.

A trend analysis of the Authority’s payable balances shows an increase in arrears from UGX.79.2Bn 1 in 2018/19, to UGX.80.1Bn at the close of the year under review. Details

are in the table below.

No	Year-End	Amount (UGX)	% change	
1	30 th June 2018	65,213,044,522		
2	30 th June 2019	79,225,591,481	22%	
3	30 th June 2020	80,126,798,519	1%	




Accrued domestic arrears adversely affect budget performance in the subsequent year as funds appropriated may be diverted to settlement of the arrears. This may also

result in litigation for non-payment of services already consumed.

The Accounting Officer explained that some domestic arrears accrue on account of multi-year commitments which are usually planned for in the budgets but insufficient funds released; others arise due to unforeseen circumstances like legal cases that are not planned for.

I advised the Accounting Officer to develop strategies of mitigating further

accumulation of arrears and also engage MoFPED to provide adequate resources for settlement of the current arrears.

4.3

Inadequate budgeting for Domestic Arrears

Section 13(10) (a) (iv) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 defines an annual











not come through and the plan is to continue engaging the Ministry of Finance to allocate resources especially the long outstanding cases like the PAYE.

I await the outcomes of the Accounting Officer’s engagement with MoFPED for allocation of additional resources.

5.0

Management of Legal costs

From my review of the Authority’s legal costs, I observed that the entity had lost a number of litigation cases and incurred significant costs in terms of legal costs and

penalties. The legal costs payable consistently increased in the past three years, as

shown in the table below.

No	Year	Amount Payable UGX	Percentage change	
1	2017/18	5,032,868,969		
2	2018/19	13,534,424,216	168%	
3	2019/20	23,155,099,427	71%	




There is a risk that if this trend is not reversed, KCCA may fail to meet its obligations which may result in additional fines and penalties.

The Accounting Officer explained that most of the high value cases between 2018/19

and 2019/20 were old cases (2016 and before) and are the cause of the growth which was not indicative of a deliberate gradual surge in new claims or cases being decided

against KCCA. Accounting Officer further stated that MoFPED availed UGX.10bn which

has been used to partially settle the legal costs and the authority has shared with

MoFPED a list of our contingent legal liabilities so that they can plan and provide

additional budget support as and when these become actual liabilities.

I await the outcomes of the engagement between the Accounting Officer and MoFPED for provision of funds to settle these cases. In future however, the Authority should

develop strategies of reversing this trend.

Other Matters

I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or

The Accounting Officer explained that this was attributed to challenges such as; cash

flow on the part of the employer occasioned by a higher than expected work rate by the contractors, contractors choosing to work faster and get off site earlier; and refund

of Garnishee to KIIP project which affected the budget lines.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage MoFPED to ensure that funds are readily

available for on-going works. In addition, the Authority should enhance and align supervision with progress of works to avoid having uncertified works which result in delayed payments.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information

comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer and other supplementary information. The

other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a

material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have

nothing to report in this regard.

Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

U nder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and

Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Kampala Capital City Authority.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is

necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.











considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain

professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:

 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether

due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for

one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty

exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Authority’s

ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial

statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions

are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However,

future events or conditions may cause the Kampala Capital City Authority to fail to deliver

its mandate.

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope

and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in

internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant

ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.











in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters

are as follows:

7.0

Management of the Authority’s fleet

Over the years, there has been increasing demand for accountability and better management of public resources by various stakeholders in Uganda, such as: The

Executive arm of Government, Parliament, Citizenry, Donors, and Civil Society, among others that prompted the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) to select fleet

management as one of the key audit issues for the audit year 2020.

Subsequently, the office developed procedures in order to assess the adequacy of government fleet management system in the delivery of public service and to identify

any impediments and make recommendations for improvement. Specifically, the audit

included ascertaining whether government vehicles were/are;

- Acquired in compliance with Government vehicle acquisition guidelines;

 Are comprehensively recorded in the assets register to ensure their proper

management;

 Are adequately allocated, operated and utilised to enable delivery of public service;  Are properly and regularly maintained to achieve optimal performance, increased

useful lives and reduced running costs; and

 Are disposed in compliance with PPDA guidelines, and disposal proceeds properly

accounted for.

The study took a scope of three financial years: 2017/18-2019/20. From the procedures

undertaken, I noted the following key observations;

No	Observation							Recommendation	
7.1	Acquisition of motor vehicles								
i	Funding for Motor vehicles acquisitionuring the three (3) financial years: 2017/18-2019/20, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) did not plan to spend any funds on the acquisition of vehicles using government funding. However, the Authority signed contracts with contractors where all vehicles procured as part of road works contracts would be handed over to the authority at the end of the contracts.DThe Authority planned the acquisition of vehicles under the Climate Change Project as shown in the table below;to spend UGX.262,152,660 onFinanci al YearBudget for Vehicle acquisition (A)Amount ReleasedActual expenditure (Actual Acquisition Costs) (B)Varianc e (B-A)0 262,152,660 0 262,152,6600 262,152,660 0 262,152,6600 262,152,660 0 262,152,6600 0 0 02017/18 2018/19 2019/20 Total								
									
									
									
									
									
									














	Comparison of the budgets with the actual funding revealed no significant variance implying that the entity received all the funds budgeted for.		
ii	Compliance with Government ban on acquisition of motor vehiclesto the Circular letter Ref; BDP/86/107/03and dated 15th May 2019 from the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury to all Accounting Officers, Government issued a freeze order on purchase of vehicles by all MDAs during FY 2019/20 with the exception of 5 Votes, which included; Office of the President, State House; Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Uganda Revenue Authority. Further guidance from the Ministry of Public Service (MoPS) through a Circular letter Ref; ADM 99/205/01 and dated 21st August 2019 indicated that clearance would only be given for procurement of vehicles under on-going donor-funded projects.I noted that the project vehicle procured at a cost of UGX.262,152,660 had clearance from MoPS in accordance with Circular Letter Ref; EO/207/307/01 of 30/03/2011.According	I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the Circular instructions.

The Vehicle was also within approved vehicle specifications.IParagraph	I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the treasury Instruction.	
iv	Compliance with vehicle standardizationService Circular Standing Instruction No. 1 of 1999 and the Establishment Notice No. 1 of 2003 about standardisation of vehicles for Ministers, other entitled officers and Projects set fuel capacity limits and specifications of the type of Vehicles to be purchased for Ministers, other entitled officers and Projects.review of the Authority’s motor vehicle fleet / procured vehicles revealed that the Authority fully complied with the approved standardisation guidelines for procurement of motor vehicles.APublic	I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the circular standing instruction	
7.2	Motor Vehicle recording		
i	Maintenance of motor vehicle records34 (2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 requires an Accounting Officer to keep a register of assets and inventory in the format prescribed by the Accountant General. Furthermore, Paragraph 16.6.1(e) & (f) of the TIs, 2017 requires recording of the acquisition cost and estimated useful life of the asset, which should assist in determining the time of replacement and depreciation cost of an asset.noted that the Authority had not recorded values for five (5) of the sampled vehicles.

	given in the Treasury Instructions, and casts doubt on the depreciation expense in the Authority’s financial statements.Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomalies and stated that these are vehicles recently surrendered by KIIDP II Project. The Authority was in the process of transferring ownership and ascertaining the values and thereafter the Asset Register will be updated.The		
ii	Updating of the fixed assets module on IFMS10.13.4 of the Tis, 2017 requires all fixed assets acquisitions to be captured in the fixed assets module of the Government Computerized Financial Management Information System (GFMIS).It was noted that all the 100 vehicles sample were not captured in the fixed assets module of the GFMISAccounting Officer indicated that the process of implementing and usage of the IFMS Asset Module to capture assets of Authority is already underway and the Authority had submitted a schedule for upload as guided by the Accountant General. The Authority was also engaging MoFPED to have the assets upload so that the Assets are all captured and updated on the IFMS system.ParagraphThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to urgently follow-up the matter the Accountant General so that the Migration is expedited.with	
7.3	Motor Vehicle Usage		
i	Existence of a fleet management policy16.3.1 of the Tis, 2017 requires the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse of vehicles.Contrary to the above, I observed that the Authority did not have a policy on Motor vehicle management to guide the usage and eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse of motor vehicles.failure to have a specific vehicle management Policy affects the Authority’s ability to address its unique motor vehicle challenges which may not be envisaged in the standing Orders and Treasury Accounting Instructions.Accounting Officer noted the observation and undertook to follow through the approval of the draft Motor Vehicle Management policy by the fourth quarter of FY 2020-2021.SectionTheThe	I await the outcomes of the Accounting Officer’s actions	
ii	Maintenance of fuel registers16.3.1 of the Tis, 2017 requires the Accounting Officer to put in place measures to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse of vehicles. Furthermore, Section 7(c) (F - i) of the public Service standing orders requires every Ministry, Department or Local Government to designate an officer to be in charge of transport matters, who shall among other duties, maintain a fuel register on any Government vehicle and carry out monthly fuel reconciliation exercises.It was observed that Kampala Capital City Authority designatedSection	I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the Treasury Instructions	














	fleet manager responsible for transport matters and fuel registers were maintained for all the motor vehicles held by the Office.		
iii	Maintenance of vehicle movement log-books7 (g) of part (F - i) of the Public Service Standing Orders requires every Government vehicle to have a logbook in which the driver records all the journeys made. It further requires that each journey entered in the logbook shall be certified by an authorised officer by countersigning against each entry.I noted that none of the vehicles sampled had up to date vehicle movement logbooks where drivers had recorded details of the vehicle movements and fuel consumptions. This was attributed to management’s failure to enforce compliance with the existing Public Service Standing Orders.The failure to maintain vehicle log books makes it difficult for management to track vehicle movements, fuel usage and vehicle maintenance expenditure. This, in turn, may lead to the misuse of vehicles for unauthorised journeys or purposes.Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly and committed to put strengthen the controls so that all vehicles movements are regularly recorded. Reinforcement mechanism like weekly analysis and review of the log-books will be reinstituted.SectionThe	I await the outcomes of the Accounting Officer’s actions	
iv	Undertaking annual motor vehicle inspections7(d) of part (F - i) of the Public Service Standing Orders requires every Government vehicle to be subject to an annual inspection irrespective of age or condition. However, a review of the records for the one hundred (100) vehicles revealed that annual inspections were not undertaken.failure to carry out annual vehicle inspections makes it difficult for management to undertake effective maintenance and replacement plans for the Authority’s fleet.Accounting Officer explained that the Authority did not undertake annual inspections since vehicles were allocated particular days of inspection and this was one of the conditions for receiving weekly fuel allocations. In addition during inspections, vehicle defects are noted and this informs decisions such as continued use of the vehicle or recommendation for boarding off.SectionTheThe	I advised the Accounting Officer to undertake the annual inspection inspections as guided by the standing orders since the weekly inspections do not appear to be comprehensive.	
v	Motor Vehicle allocation15-part F-I of the Public Service Standing Orders provides that a public officer at the level of Director and above shall be entitled to a chauffeur-driven vehicle at a Government expense. Section 16 further provides that a public officer at the level of a Head of Department (scale U1SE) shall be provided with an official vehicle for official duties including house to office running.I reviewed the allocation of motor vehicles by the Authority and noted most of the Authority’s vehicles were managed through the pool system. In the few cases where officers were allocated vehicles, I noted that the officers were entitled.Section	I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the standing orders.	














vi	Support to Entity Service DeliveryCapital City Authority is divided into nine sectors, i.e., Physical Planning, Social Development, Health, etc. The number and type of Vehicles allocated to each service sector is key to service delivery, and the allocation list shows whether a sector or units is allocated vehicles.I noted that the KCCA manages its vehicles through a pool system where different departments make requests for vehicles on a needs basis. I, therefore, did not find evidence of imbalanced allocation of vehicles within the Authority’s departments.Kampala		
vii	Drivers’ Competences for adequate operation of entity fleet14 of part F-I of public service standing Orders, 2010 provides that to encourage and sustain the highest level of care and responsibility for Government vehicles on the part of individual drivers, the following shall apply:Undergo a driving test by the Chief Mechanical Engineer prior to assumption of duty. Periodic training including defensive driving at a recognized Training Institute. Periodic testing every three years on traffic regulations and an annual medical check-up, including eye testing.A review of staff records for a sample of 20 drivers out of a total of 125 employed by the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) revealed the following;i. All drivers possessed valid driving permits. ii. All drivers had evidence of performance appraisal; although, none had undertaken additional training and obtained additional skills. iii. None of the drivers sampled had undertaken annual medical examination as required to obtain their fitness status. This may put the lives of the officials they drive in danger in case of an undetected medical challenge that may hamper their ability to drive. It is a recruitment requirement for all prospective drivers to undergo a driving test conducted by the Chief Mechanical Engineer prior to assumption of duty. Audit, however, noted that only two drivers (10%) of the sampled 20 had undertaken a driving test prior to assumption of duties.iv.Accounting officer acknowledged the anomaly and promised to  undertake corrective action.SectionThe	I await the outcome of the Accounting Officers actions.	
7.4	Motor Vehicle maintenance		
i	Adequacy of Vehicle Maintenance Funding16.9.1 of the TIs, 2017 requires the Accounting Officer to prepare an annual budget for asset maintenance, and assess the functionality, utilization, and physical and financial performance of assets held.A review of the approved work plan and budget revealed that the KCCA budgeted UGX 7.12Bn for vehicle maintenance during theParagraph	I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoFPED for provision adequate resources for the Authority’s budget.

spent a total of UGX.5.82 resulting in a shortfall of UGX.1.3Bn which is 5.5% of the budgeted as indicated in the table below;

The Accounting Officer explained that the limitation of the MTEF allocations to KCCA has affected the funding of many activities including motor vehicle repairs.

ii Maintenance of motor vehicle service analysis records

Section 13 of the Public Service Standing Orders requires the driver to ensure that Government vehicles are regularly serviced (including oiling and greasing), a Service Chart will be kept by the Transport Officer (T/O) on every Government vehicle in his or her charge. It, however, the duty of the driver of the vehicle to ensure that the service chart is followed strictly.

On the contrary, I noted that repair and service analysis registers for the one hundred (100) vehicles were not maintained. I further observed that there were no service charts for all the One hundred (100) vehicles.

The failure to keep track of vehicle service chart may cause delayed servicing, which in turn could lead to faster ageing of vehicles and high vehicle maintenance and replacement costs.

The Accounting Officer indicated that the dual responsibility for

vehicle maintenance shared between the directorates of Engineering and Technical Service and Administration and Human Resource has been creating a challenge in monitoring of the vehicle maintenance. Furthermore, management has developed procedures and process flow charts indicating responsibilities of each party and commits to create an effective mechanism for monitoring compliance to the guidelines and procedures for vehicle maintenance.

I await the outcome of the Accounting Officer’s actions.

ii Assessment of the Vehicle Disposal ProceduresPublic Procurement and Disposal Public Assets Act, 2003 (as amended) and PPDA Regulations, 2014, together with the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 have prescribed various requirements for the disposal of public assets. A review of a sample of 28 vehicles disposed of by Kampala Capital City Authority revealed the following;i. All Vehicles disposed of were recorded in the disposal plan. ii. All Vehicles disposed of were recommended for disposal byiii. All Vehicles disposed of followed the recommended disposalthe Board of Survey.method. iv.

early January 2021, and it’s anticipated that the key issues on the manual in this meeting will be resolved. The approved manual is anticipated to be out by the second

quarter of FY 2021/22.

I await the outcome of the Accounting Officer’s engagement with Ministry of Public Service.

8.2

Expired appointments for Acting Authority staff

Section A of Public Service Standing Orders 2010 (Appointment procedures (a-c) 9 requires that an appointment on acting basis is expected to last not more than six months, and any period of acting appointment beyond six months would be null and void, and the officer holding such an appointment should automatically revert to his or

her substantive post, unless the Appointing Authority extends the appointment for

another period of six months, but should not exceed 12 months in total.

I noted that a number of KCCA staff were assigned responsibilities for which they have

no substantive appointments for a period of more than twelve 12 months contrary to

the Public Service Standing Orders.

officers.

This may negatively affect the morale of these

The Accounting Officer explained that this decision was taken by Management to deal

with the issue of inadequate staffing levels arising out of the many vacant positions. The Authority has planned a recruitment exercise in this Financial Year 2020/2021.

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the recruitment of staff so that vacant

positions are substantively filled.

9.0

Management of land owned by the authority

9.1

Failure to approve land management guidelines

Good practice requires that the Authority develops and approved guidelines to

streamline the management of land, given its importance and level of stakeholder

interest in the subject. The guidelines would address the acquisition, utilization, management and disposal of these properties. These guidelines would also ensure compliance with the Physical Planning Act and promote equity and transparency.











9.2

Failure to transfer ownership of the Authority’s Property - Land titles

Paragraph 16.3.1 of the 2017 Treasury Instructions state that the Accounting Officer of

an institution must take full responsibility and ensure that proper control systems exist for the proper management of non-current assets and those preventative mechanisms are in place to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse.

A review of the Kampala Capital City Authority property inventory as of 1 st September

2020 revealed that the Authority owned a number of properties whose ownership

deeds had not been transferred in the authority’s name. This exposes the land and

property to theft or loss, mismanagement and nugatory costs of reclaiming encroached on land, if these risks materialize.

The Accounting Officer stated that the process of transferring the highlighted titles into KCCA’s names is ongoing and the delay is normally occasioned by factors outside the

Authority’s control, such as lodgment of caveats by third parties and bureaucratic

process of controlling authorities such as ULC and BLB which slows down the process

but however, all the pending transactions are actively being pursued.

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the processes of having all land that belongs to the Authority transferred in the Authority’s names.

10.0 Non- remittance of statutory deductions

Paragraph 10.23.1 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 states that statutory deductions

from public officers, where applicable, shall be effected through the payroll and

remitted promptly to the respective institutions. Such statutory deductions include Pay as You Earn (PAYE), Local Service Tax (LST), NSSF contributions and contributions to

the workers’ unions.

I noted that by the end of the financial year, KCCA made statutory deduction amounting to UGX 33.3Bn but had not remitted this to the respective institutions as

shown in the table below.

No	Details	Amount UGX	Beneficiary Institution	
1	PAYE	32,576,248,043	URA	
2	NSSF contributions	701,609,675	NSSF	
		33,277,857,718		














I advised the Accounting Officer to engage URA and NSSF to agree on a payment plan for these outstanding obligations as a way of mitigating against possible penalties and fines.
