The activities that were not sufficiently quantified were;  Tourism and Public library promotion activities,  Rehabilitation of Secondary Schools Infrastructure  Procurement of leases on KCCA Land  Registration and valuation of city properties  Maintenance of public health centers and purchase of medical equipment  Health infrastructure rehabilitated  Training of primary leaving exams invigilators Failure to plan and report on the quality/quantity of activities implemented renders it difficult to establish the reasonableness of individual activity costs for each planned output which curtails effective accountability when funds are subsequently spent. Further, without clearly and fully quantified outputs, I could not ascertain the level of achievement of these outputs and whether funds appropriated by Parliament and released were spent and the intended objectives achieved. Fully quantified outputs Insufficie ntly quantified outputs Outputs not quantified I Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly and noted that with the introduction of the Program based budgeting there has been a detailed review of all KCCA plans by program which is going to significantly improve on the planning and reporting and this weakness observed will be resolved The",Unnamed: 1,Unnamed: 2,Unnamed: 3,Unnamed: 4,Unnamed: 5,Unnamed: 6,Unnamed: 7,Unnamed: 8,Unnamed: 9,Unnamed: 10,Unnamed: 11

The entity implemented all the forty-five (45) activities (100%) within these outputs. Four (4) output with a total of ten (10) activities worth UGX 0.489Bn was partially implemented. Out of the ten (2) activities, the entity fully implemented two (2) activities (20%), seven (7) activities were partially implemented (70%), while one (1) activity (10%) remained 1.6 Implementation of quantified outputs I  ", , , , , , , , , , ,I advised the Accounting Officer to engage MoFPED to have funds availed so that the activities are implemented in the subsequent period.
