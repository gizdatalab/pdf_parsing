0,iii,"Maintenance of vehicle movement log-books 7 (g) of part (F - i) of the Public Service Standing Orders requires every Government vehicle to have a logbook in which the driver records all the journeys made. It further requires that each journey entered in the logbook shall be certified by an authorised officer by countersigning against each entry. I noted that none of the vehicles sampled had up to date vehicle movement logbooks where drivers had recorded details of the vehicle movements and fuel consumptions. This was attributed to management’s failure to enforce compliance with the existing Public Service Standing Orders. The failure to maintain vehicle log books makes it difficult for management to track vehicle movements, fuel usage and vehicle maintenance expenditure. This, in turn, may lead to the misuse of vehicles for unauthorised journeys or purposes. Accounting Officer acknowledged the anomaly and committed to put strengthen the controls so that all vehicles movements are regularly recorded. Reinforcement mechanism like weekly analysis and review of the log-books will be reinstituted. Section The",I await the outcomes of the Accounting Officer’s actions
1,iv,"Undertaking annual motor vehicle inspections 7(d) of part (F - i) of the Public Service Standing Orders requires every Government vehicle to be subject to an annual inspection irrespective of age or condition. However, a review of the records for the one hundred (100) vehicles revealed that annual inspections were not undertaken. failure to carry out annual vehicle inspections makes it difficult for management to undertake effective maintenance and replacement plans for the Authority’s fleet. Accounting Officer explained that the Authority did not undertake annual inspections since vehicles were allocated particular days of inspection and this was one of the conditions for receiving weekly fuel allocations. In addition during inspections, vehicle defects are noted and this informs decisions such as continued use of the vehicle or recommendation for boarding off. Section The The",I advised the Accounting Officer to undertake the annual inspection inspections as guided by the standing orders since the weekly inspections do not appear to be comprehensive.
2,v,"Motor Vehicle allocation 15-part F-I of the Public Service Standing Orders provides that a public officer at the level of Director and above shall be entitled to a chauffeur-driven vehicle at a Government expense. Section 16 further provides that a public officer at the level of a Head of Department (scale U1SE) shall be provided with an official vehicle for official duties including house to office running. I reviewed the allocation of motor vehicles by the Authority and noted most of the Authority’s vehicles were managed through the pool system. In the few cases where officers were allocated vehicles, I noted that the officers were entitled. Section",I commended the Accounting Officer for complying with the standing orders.
