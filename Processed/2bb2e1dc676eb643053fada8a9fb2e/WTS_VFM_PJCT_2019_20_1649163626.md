# REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF KAPCHORWA SUAM KITALE AND ELDORET BYPASS ROADS PROJECT, PROJECT ID NO.P-ZI-DB0-107, ADB LOAN NO. 2000200001051 AND ADF LOAN NO. 2100150037299 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH JUNE, 2020

## THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

## Opinion

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Kapchorwa Suam and Eldoret Bypass Roads Project implemented by Uganda National Roads Authority for the year ended 30 th June

2020. These financial statements comprise of the Statement of Receipts and Payments and the Statement of Fund Balances for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies adopted and other explanatory notes.

In my opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly in all material respects, Kapchorwa Suam and Eldoret Bypass Roads Project Statement of Receipts and Payments, and the Statement of Fund Balance for the year ended 30 th June 2020, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ADF and DFID funding agreements, and the cash basis of accounting described in Note 8 of the financial statements.

## Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of Project Management in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act 2008, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements in Uganda, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below as key audit matters to be communicated in my report.

- **Compensation of Project Affected Persons**

Section 42 of the Land Act, 1998 empowers Government to acquire land for public interest in exchange for compensation of owners or tenants based upon market value of the land plus disturbance allowance.

Government of Uganda received financing support from the African Development Bank and African Development Fund (ADF) to implement the Kapchorwa Suam Road Project. The Project comprises of among other components the upgrading of Kapchorwa-Suam Road (73km) and supervision consultancy, studies, training of unemployed youth and capacity building; compensation and resettlement. Before implementing this project and in accordance with the laws of Uganda, Government had to acquire rights by valuation of Project Affected

---

Persons (PAPs) land, compensating the Project Affected Persons and finally demarcating the right of way.

The area was identified during the risk assessment of the project, at the preliminary stage of the planning of the audit as a significant service delivery point, directly impacting on its mandate and an area of high stakeholder concern on the operational efficiency of the project. I focused on this area because some of the PAPs disputed the amounts assessed by UNRA and they have not yet been paid, and delayed compensation or non-compensation of PAPs affects progress of civil works.

I designed specific programmes for execution to ascertain whether all valuations are done in accordance with the applicable law, regulations and best practice, whether the compensation process is fair, just and complete, whether persons compensated are the bona-fide owners of the land and, to establish procedures and action taken after compensation of PAPs.

Based on the above procedures I noted the following:

| **No** | **Observations** | **Recommendations** |

In addition, some PAPs within the possessed section had not been compensated. The delayed compensation of the PAPs has led to the delayed access and possession of the land for the road length to the contractor. commencement of PAPs’ claims before  of construction exposes the project to refusal of handover of land by PAPs, litigation costs by the PAPs, delayed project implementation and a risk of the Donors withdrawal of funding.

| **1.2** | in **Non-compliance** with Contractual Obligations – Delays in execution of** **Project Civil Works**  Included the financial statements under Note 9.2.1.2 is  50,305,243,150 (inclusive of advance payment of 20% of the contract value) relating to Civil Works. The amount accounts for 83.6% of the total cumulative project expenditure  (UGX 60,113,394,725) exclusive of funds re-allocated. UGX State I noted that UNRA engaged M/S China  Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd on the 7 th May 2018 to upgrade Kapchorwa-Suam road for a period of 36 months with effect from 1st October 2018. However, the physical progress as at June 30, 2020 (at 58.3% time lapse) was 17.26% against 31.84%  a cumulative lag of 14.58%. The Project  has significantly delayed. Primarily, causes of delays are;   Adverse weather conditions.  Denied access to the full site by the PAPs who have not been compensated. planned with implementation  Scarcity of especially G 15. material  Numerous embedded rocks in addition to the exposed rock. The quantity of rock is over whelming as opposed to the BOQ quantities (The quantities of rock as per the contract are 350,000m 3 and 1,022,470m 3 as per draft design review). This calls for additional equipment for rock drilling and blasting with the cost of surplus rock disposal. clarified that;   Designs for the section from Management | to finalize have advised Management together with the Supervising Consultant  the approval process of the design review to determine the scope of work and the PAPs, with the related costs and also request the Contractor to mobilize additional  and equipment. personnel I |

## Other Information

additional equipment.

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Project background, objectives and management information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my audit report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.

I have nothing to report in this regard.

## Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Project financial statements in accordance with Government of Uganda and African Development Bank Guidelines, and the cash basis of accounting as described under section 8.1 to the financial statements and for maintenance of such internal controls as management determines is necessary for the preparation and fair presentation of the Project financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Project’s ability to achieve its core objectives, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to the achievement of its objectives, unless management either intends to close the project or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  
Management is responsible for overseeing the Project’s financial reporting process.

## Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:

---

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Project’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Project to fail to deliver on its mandate.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with Management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide Management with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Management, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Other Regulatory and Reporting Requirements

I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements:

## Compliance with the Provisions of the Loan Agreement and Contractual Obligations

Except for the following matters, UNRA complied with the loan agreement covenants. I have obtained all the information and explanations, and all expenses were eligible.

---

- **Works Contract -Forward Maintenance of the Road**

According to clause 1239 of the special specification of the contract, the contractor is required to maintain the existing road and ensure no potholes such that light vehicles can travel at a nominal speed of 50km/hr. However, by the time of the site visit, the road was almost impassable from km 31 to km 73 (42km). The contractor attributes this to the terrain of the project area.

Failure to maintain the existing road affects the main objective of the project which is to improve connectivity between Uganda and Kenya as well as to stimulate economic activities in East Africa.

Management explained that the Engineer instructs the above works and the contractor duly complies. However, during rainy weather, the road deteriorates due to the nature of soils as stated in section A3.2 of the scope of works in the contract, where the road is described as an earth road which is impassable during bad weather conditions. Management further explained that as a solution to this, they have proposed that the contractor executes permanent works in the most difficult sections.

I advised Management to fast track compensation of PAPs so that the contractor has access to site for all the 73km of the road, and enable execution of permanent works.

## GoU Counterpart Funding

I confirm that the Government of Uganda has fulfilled its counterpart obligations of the project for the year ended 30 th June 2020.

## Internal Controls

As part of my audit scope and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, I considered internal controls relevant to UNRA in the preparation and fair presentation of Kapchorwa-Suam Project financial statements for the year ended 30 th June 2020, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate. Other than the matters referred to in the report, the Internal Control structure for Kapchorwa-Suam Project, was found to be appropriate.
