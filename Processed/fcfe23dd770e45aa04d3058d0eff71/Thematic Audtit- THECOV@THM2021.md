### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The outbreak of Covid-19 was detected in the country in March 2020 and as a result, Government imposed restrictions to combat the spread of the disease. This affected the performance of the economy and the livelihoods of majority of citizens. It is against this background that Government came up with multi-sectoral interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic which included provision of supplementary funds to entities, and provision of relief items to sections of the population that were worst affected.

During the financial year 2019/2020 government sourced for support of UGX.4.361tn. Included in the UGX.4.361tn is UGX.4.297tn that was received as budget support from which Parliament of Uganda approved a supplementary budget of UGX.284bn for multi-sectoral interventions, to enable the Government respond to and manage the Covid-19 pandemic. The approved funds were disbursed by the Treasury to 134 districts and 11 MDAs for the purpose.

In addition, UGX.27.23bn was availed from the Contingency funds to support the Ministry of Health (UGX.25bn), Office of the Prime Minister (UGX.2bn) and Embassy of Beijing (UGX.233m).

This report is in respect of the UGX.311bn comprising of UGX.284bn disbursed to the MDAs and districts, and UGX.27.23bn released from the Contingency Fund.

Below is a summary of the key findings, details of which are included in individual reports issued separately;

i.  
UGX.6.68bn (2%) out of UGX.284bn was not utilized by four (4) entities at the close of the financial year and was subsequently returned to the consolidated. This affected the implementation of the planned activities.

ii.  
Contrary to the PS/STâ€™s guidance to bank the funds intact, UGX.0.85bn (5%) out of UGX.17.24bn total cash donations was utilised at source in 56 entities. The balance of UGX.16.38bn was banked on designated accounts of the entities as guided by the PS/ST.

iii.  
Out of 151 entities analyzed, 149 (99%) entities had work plans with a total of 3,236 activities. Out of these, 3,025 activities were fully quantified while 211 (6.5%) activities were not sufficiently quantified which hindered me from assessing the extent of achievement of the activities.

Out of the 3,025 quantified activities, 2,872 (94%) activities were fully implemented while 109 (4%) were partially implemented, and 44 (1%) were not implemented at all.

iv.  
A total of 25 entities undertook procurements worth UGX.143.84bn without fully adhering to the procurement rules and regulations. Some of the anomalies observed included: irregular use of direct procurements, procurements without signed contracts, late delivery of goods, payments before receiving goods and failure to involve the contracts committee.

v.  
UGX.1.317bn (5%) out of the UGX.284bn that was disbursed to seventeen (17) entities remained unaccounted for at the time of audit. I therefore could not establish whether the funds were put to proper use.

## iv

---

vi.  
94 (68%) out of 135 entities that received donations in kind did not undertake valuations contrary to paragraph 15.5.1 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 while 69 (51%) entities did not record the donated items in the stores. This resulted into misstatement of financial statement balances.

vii.  
A total of 45 entities faced challenges in the management and operation of quarantine centres under their charge. The challenges faced included: insufficient PPEs, lack of necessary staff at the quarantine centres, failure to provide basic utilities such as water and power and non-utilisation of the quarantine centres. This may have hampered Government efforts towards the containment of the spread of the pandemic.

viii.  
Items valued at UGX.55.8bn (20%) were distributed under the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) lacked sufficient evidence of acknowledgement to enable me verify the recipients. This was attributed to the emergency nature of the exercise.

ix.  
Quality checks by UNBS on a sample of 14,069 metric tonnes of maize flour and 8,547 metric tonnes of dry-beans established that 2,615 (19%) metric tonnes of maize flour and 2,017 (24%) metric tonnes of dry-beans intended for distribution by Office of the Prime Minister did not pass quality checks.

x.  
UGX.10.574bn (4%) in six (6) entities was diverted and spent on items other than those for which the funds were disbursed.

### Overall Audit Conclusion

Government took measures to respond to the pandemic and audit observed commendable performance where 98% of the budgeted funds were utilised, 95% was banked intact as per guidelines, 99% of the entities had work plans, 94.5% of activities were well quantified. Of these 94% of the activities were fully implemented

A number of shortcomings were however also noted in the way entities implemented the measures. These included under absorption of funds of 2%, use of cash at source of 5%, non- compliance with procurement laws, 0.5% of the funds were not accounted for, 4% of the funds were diverted, inadequate valuation of in-kind donations and poor management of quarantine centres. These were mainly attributed to the emergency conditions under which the entities were operating and the lockdown measures instituted by Government to control the spread of the disease. I therefore advised Government to put in place measures to raise preparedness for the management of emergency situations.

# 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background

The outbreak of Covid-19 was detected in the country in March 2020 and as a result, Government imposed restrictions to combat the spread of the disease. This affected the performance of the economy and the livelihoods of the majority of citizens.

In addition to the above, the outbreak also impacted on the tax collections by Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) which necessitated alternative sources of financing the Government budget amounting to UGX.4,361tn as summarised below; Details are in

### Appendix I.

#### Table 1: Showing Receipts for Covid-19 related Government Interventions

| **S/N** | **Funding Source** | **Purpose** | **Amount (UGX. Bn)** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1. | Loans 1 | Budget support | 4,297.40 |  
| 2. | Grants | Project support | 17.98 |  
| 3. | Local cash donations | Direct support | 11.60 |  
| 4. | In-kind donations 2 | Direct support | 34.55 |  
|| **TOTAL** || **4,361.53** |  


Additionally UGX.27.23bn was availed from the Contingency funds to support the Ministry of Health (UGX.25bn), Office of the Prime Minister (UGX.2bn) and Embassy of Beijing (UGX.233m).

Of the UGX.4.297tn budget support, Parliament of Uganda approved a supplementary budget of UGX.284bn for multi sectoral interventions, to enable the Government respond to and manage the Covid-19 pandemic. The funds were disbursed by the Treasury to 134 districts and 11 MDAs for the purpose during the financial year 2019/2020. **Refer to Appendix II.**

This report is in respect of the UGX.311bn comprising of UGX.284bn disbursed to the MDAs and districts, UGX.27bn released from the Contingency Fund and the in-kind donations received by the various entities. It excludes a total of UGX.17.69bn where separate reports were or will be issued as summarised below;

| **Category** | **Amount (UGX. Bn)** | **Comment** |  
|---|---|---|  
| Classified Expenditure | 7.46 | A separate report will be issued. |  
| Parliamentary Commission | 10.0 | This expenditure was audited and a separate report issued. |  
| Embassy of Beijing | 0.23 | A separate report will be issued. |  
| **TOTAL** | **17.69** ||  


It is against this background that Government came up with multi-sector interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic which included provision of supplementary funds to entities, and provision of relief items to sections of the population that were worst affected.

1 Details of the loans received are contained in Appendix I to the report.  
2 This amount excludes in kind donations received by MOH and LGs which had not been valued by the time of reporting. 1

### Objectives of the audit

The objectives of the audit of the Covid-19 funds were to establish whether;

i.  
Funds released were fully absorbed by the implementing entities  
ii.  
Cash collections were banked intact and not used at source.  
iii.  
Entities prepared and approved work plans that were sufficiently quantified to guide the utilisation of the funds received.  
iv. Planned activities were fully implemented.  
v.  
Procurements were undertaken in compliance with PPDA regulations and guidelines. vi.  
Funds received by the entities were fully accounted for.  
vii. In-kind donations received were properly valued, taken on charge and accounted for in line with the PFMA and Treasury Instructions.  
viii. Gazetted quarantine centres were managed in line with guidance from Ministry of Health.  
ix. Recruitment of health workers was in compliance with the Public Service Standing Orders and Health Service Commission regulations.  
x.  
There were no diversions of Covid-19 funds.  
xi.  
Relief items distributed met the required UNBS quality standards.

### 1.3 Data collection methodology

Data was collected through the following methods;

### Interviews

Key stakeholders including the Accounting Officers, entity planners, program implementation coordinators, and other public officers were interviewed to gain an understanding of the activities that were implemented, the rationale for those activities and how they were implemented.

### Review of documents

Key records were reviewed, including the resolution of Parliament on the supplementary budget for Covid-19, the total approved supplementary budget, entity budgets and work-plans, procurement files, stores records, registers of donations and expenditure records.

### Third party verifications

In some cases third parties and informants were contacted with the view of confirming the information presented in the various reports and from interviews. Third parties interviewed included suppliers and users/beneficiaries of the interventions.

### Inspections

Limited physical inspections were done to confirm the delivery of goods/supplies, the management of quarantine centres and the execution of works.

---

### 1.4 Limitations

I was unable to examine the utilisation of UGX.233m Covid-19 funds disbursed to the Uganda Embassy in Beijing due to travel restrictions caused by the lockdown. I was also unable to physically verify the status, assets and management of some quarantine centres due to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which limited access to the facilities. Lastly, funds that were used for classified activities were not assessed as part of this report and have been included in a separate report.

**2.0**

### SUMMARY OF KEY PROCESSES

**2.1**

### Supplementary budget approval process

The preparation, approval and the implementation of the supplementary budget goes through a number of processes which have been highlighted below;

### 2.1.1 Supplementary budget formulation

The implementing entity identifies unbudgeted-for priorities that should be urgent, unforeseen and cannot be postponed. The entity then proposes estimates of the required budget/funding supported by work-plans.

The estimates are then presented to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MOFPED) who compiles, consolidates and presents the estimates to cabinet and to Parliament for review and approval.

### 2.1.2 Supplementary budget approval

Once the supplementary budget is presented to Parliament, it is debated adjusted and approved. The approved budget is included in the supplementary appropriations bill. The approved supplementary budget is then communicated by Parliament to the MOFPED, the beneficiaries, and other stakeholders for implementation.

### 2.1.3 Supplementary budget implementation

Once the supplementary budget is approved by Parliament, the Auditor General issues a grant of credit authorising the Minister of Finance to release the funds to the MDA, up to the amount of the supplementary budget approved by Parliament.

The entities then use the resources allocated under the supplementary budgets on the activities for which the funds were sought and in line with the approved work-plans.

**2.2**

### Receipt and utilisation of donations

### 2.2.1 Receipt of cash donations

Every district was expected to establish a committee or task-force which was responsible for receiving cash donations. Cash donations from the public that were not sent to the districts were received by the National Task Force under Office of the Prime Minister.

3

---

Once a cash donation was made, the donorâ€™s particulars such as name, contact and amount donated were captured and a receipt issued to confirm receipt of the cash donations.

In some cases, the funds were banked directly on designated bank accounts after which the donors presented evidence of the banking to the District Task Forces (DTFs) or National Task Force (NTF) for issuance of receipt.

The DTFs and NTF regularly compiled reports for all the cash donations and undertook regular reconciliations for purposes of financial reporting.

### 2.2.2 Receipt, valuation and utilisation of in-kind donations

When a donation in kind was made, the respective task force (district or national) received and recorded the details of the donor and the items donated. The details captured included particulars of the donor, items donated and quantities. Once these were received, the donor was issued with an acknowledgement to confirm that the in- kind items had been received.

The items were then valued using either purchase price declared by the donor or using market prices or prices of similar items.

The items were then received in stores by the entities with the issuance of Goods Received Notes. Any disbursement from the stores was preceded by approval of the task forces for the distribution of such items. The items were then disbursed from stores using issue vouchers for distribution to the beneficiaries.

Entities maintained updated records of in-kind donations received, issued and distributed for purposes of reporting.

**3.0**

### FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following is a summary of the key findings from my examination of the management of the Covid-19 interventions during the financial year 2019-2020. The detailed findings are in the individual reports which I have issued separately.

**3.1**

### Under absorption of released funds

Section 17(2) of the PFMA 2015 provides that a vote that does not expend money that was appropriated to the vote for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year, repay the money to the consolidated fund.

Out of the total funds disbursed, I noted that a sum of UGX.6.68bn in four (4) entities was unspent at the year end and returned to the consolidated fund. Details are in **Appendix III.** This was mainly attributed to the fact that entities were working at 30% capacity which affected the operational efficiency of these entities thus resulting into under absorption. I also noted that funds to these entities were disbursed towards the end of the Financial Year 2019/2020 which also affected their absorption.

Under absorption of funds resulted into non-implementation of planned activities.

4

---

I advised the Accounting Officers to come up with better strategies of managing such emergencies should they re-occur.

**3.2**

### Utilisation of cash at source (UGX.0.85bn)

Paragraph 1(a) of the Guidelines for management of Covid-19 response fund donations issued by the PS/ST to all Accounting Officers (on the 28 th April, 2020) states that all cash contributions shall be banked directly by the donors on the national collection account.

I reviewed the management of cash donations by MDAs and the Local Authorities and noted that government collected a sum of UGX.17.24bn from various sources as highlighted below:

#### Table 2: Summarizing cash collections

| **S/N** | **Entity** | **Amount** |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Office of the Prime Minister | 9,307,902,542 |  
| 2 | Ministry of Health | 2,321,652,400 |  
| 3 | Local governments | 5,610,543,023 |  
|| **TOTAL** | **17,240,097,965** |  


I reviewed the utilisation of this cash and noted the following;

i)  
UGX.9.307bn that was collected by the OPM was all transferred to the National Response Fund to Covid-19 account in Bank of Uganda. It was subsequently transferred to the consolidated fund.

ii)  
UGX.2.321bn that was received through the Ministry of Health as cash donations from various local sources was banked on the Ministryâ€™s contingenciesâ€™ fund account and subsequently transferred to the consolidated fund.

iii) Out of UGX.5.610bn collected by Local Governments, UGX.4.758bn (84.8%) was banked before use leaving a balance of UGX.0.852bn (15.2%) which was spent at source contrary to the PS/STâ€™s guidance. See details in **Appendix IV.** This was 0.05% of total collections

A total of 99.95% of the collections was transferred to the UCF according to the guidelines and I commend government for the action.

For the 0.05% of collections not banked intact, the Accounting Officers of the affected Local Governments explained that failure to comply with the guidance on use of cash was due to the need to respond expeditiously to the emergencies occasioned by the pandemic and the lockdown measures instituted by Government. I noted the explanation but advised that failure to bank the cash exposes the funds to the risk of loss and misuse and in future it is important to ensure compliance with guidelines in totality.

**3.3**

### Preparation and approval of work-plans

Paragraph 23 of the budget execution circular 2019/2020 requires that all supplementary budget requests must be supported by a realistic work plan and budget.

5

---

I noted that generally all the entities allocated Covid-19 funds prepared work-plans to guide the utilisation of these funds.

I have nothing material to report in this regard.

**3.4**

### Quantification and implementation of planned activities

I reviewed the extent to which work plans for 151 entities were quantified to facilitate the measurement of performance. I observed that 3,236 activities were planned for implementation out of which 3,025 (93.4%) were sufficiently quantified while 211 (6.5%) activities were not quantified at all, contrary to the budget execution circular issued by the PS/ST as summarised in the table below and detailed in **Appendix V (a).**

#### Table 3: Quantification of activities

| **No** | **Details** | **No of activities** | **%age** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Fully quantified activities | 3,025 | 94% |  
| 2 | Insufficiently quantified activities | 211 | 6% |  
|| **Total** | **3,236** | **100%** |  


I further examined the extent to which 3,025 quantified activities were implemented and noted that 2,872 (94%) were fully implemented, 109 (4%) activities were partially implemented while 44 (1%) activities were not implemented at all as summarised in the table below and detailed in **Appendix V (b).**

#### Table 4: Implementation of quantified activities

| **No** | **Category** | **No of activities** | **% of total no of activities** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Fully Implemented | 2,872 | 94% |  
| 2 | Partially Implemented | 109 | 4% |  
| 3 | Not Implemented | 44 | 1% |  
|| **Total** | **3,025** | **100%** |  


Failure to quantify activities creates ambiguities in allocation of funds and budget slack which can be exploited to divert funds. On the other hand, failure to implement planned activities implies that the expected or intended services were not received by the beneficiaries. The Accounting Officers attributed this to the nature of some of the activities that were difficult to quantify, as well as the emergency nature of the activities.

The extent of quantification of 94% and implementation of quantified activities of 94% is a reasonably good performance and I commend government. I advise further that it is important that full quantification and implementation be aimed at in future to ensure full attainment of government objectives even in emergencies.

**3.5**

### Non-compliance with procurement regulations

Paragraph 5 of the guidelines issued by the PS/ST on the receipt and accountability for donations for Covid-19 requires Accounting Officers to follow PPDA regulations which guide on how procurements should be undertaken under emergency conditions.

6

---

I noted that 25 entities allocated Covid-19 funds undertook procurements worth UGX.143.84bn using funds received as part of the Covid-19 response. My review of the procurement records revealed various anomalies as indicated in the table below and

### Appendix VI.

| **No** | **Procurement Issue** | **Entities** | **Amount (UGX.)Bn** |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Delays and non-delivery of procured items | Ministry of Defence Nakaseke DLG Buikwe DLG  Dokolo DLG Ministry of Health | 65.9 |  
| 2 | Use of the inappropriate procurement methods | Uganda Police Force Buikwe DLG Kassanda DLG Amolatar DLG  Kumi DLG  Ministry of Health | 4.824 |  
| 3 | Use of non-prequalified suppliers | Masindi DLG Kagadi DLG Buliisa DLG Bugweri DLG | 0.015 |  
| 4 | By-passing of the contracts committees | Uganda Prisons Services Butebo DLG  Abim DLG  Moroto DLG  Soroti DLG  Ministry of Health | 0.239 |  
| 5 | Failure to justify the use of direct procurements | Ministry of Defence Uganda Prisons Services Office of the President Kole DLG  Kyankwanzi DLG  Kiboga DLG  Kassanda DLG  Butebo DLG  Abim DLG  Moroto DLG  Karenga DLG | 15.13 |  
| 6 | Procurement without signed contracts | Ministry of Defence Lira DLG | 1.321 |  
| 7 | Failure to subject procured items to quality checks | Ministry of Health ||  
| 8 | Failure to properly maintain procurement records | Uganda Police Force Buikwe DLG  Kween DLG. | 7.935 |  
| 9 | Non-compliance to contracts terms and conditions | Uganda Police Force Uganda Prisons Service Ministry of Health | 4.036 |  


The failure to strictly adhere to procurement regulations and contractual terms was attributed to the emergency nature of the procurements given the prevailing circumstances.

7

---

Non-compliance with the procurement regulations exposes public funds to misuse and impairs the achievement of value for money.

I advised Accounting Officers to adhere to the procurement guidelines even in cases of emergencies.

### 3.6 Unaccounted for funds

Paragraph 10.10.1 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 provides that all payments must be adequately supported with sufficient details to enable them to be checked without reference to any other documents. I reviewed the Covid-19 expenditure records and noted that funds amounting to UGX.1.318bn (0.5%) remained unaccounted for in seventeen (17) entities at the time of reporting. Details are in **Appendix VII.**

Failure to account for funds was attributed to the peculiar circumstances of the pandemic and lockdown measures which affected the operations of the entities and thus the ability to prepare and present the accountabilities. Without sufficient accountabilities, I was unable to confirm the authenticity and accuracy of the purported expenditure incurred by the different entities.

I advised the concerned Accounting Officers to follow up on all pending accountabilities and ensure that all expended funds are fully accounted for, failure of which the funds should be recovered.

**3.7**

### Management of in-kind donations

Paragraph 15.5.1 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 states that inventories are accounted for by value as well as by quantity, and it is necessary for an Accounting Officer to keep records so as to determine the unit cost of each inventory item and the reconciliation of the total value of the stocks of inventories with the financial records. The PS/ST also guided in his circular on the management of the Covid-19 interventions that all items received in kind should be taken on charge, and distributed with the approval of the Covid-19 task force and appropriately accounted for.

I observed that 135 entities received in-kind donations from various sources. From my review of the receipt and utilisation of these items I observed the following;

i.  
Forty-one (41) (30%) entities undertook valuations of these items as guided by the PS/ST while 94 (70%) entities never valued items. Details in **Appendix VIII (a).** I was therefore unable to confirm the value of these donations in kind and the accuracy of the balances reported in the financial statements.

ii.  
A total of 69 (51%) entities did not record the items donated in their stores records which exposed them to the risk of theft and misuse. **Appendix VIII (b)** refers.

iii.  
In 66 Local Authorities (49%) there was no evidence that the distribution of the donated items was approved by the District Task Forces as guided by the PS/ST implying that items could have been distributed to persons who were not the target beneficiaries. **Appendix VIII (c)** refers.

8

---

iv.  
In 50 entities (37%), there was either insufficient or no evidence of receipt of items by beneficiaries casting doubt on the accuracy of the distributions reported. **Appendix VIII (d)** refers.

The failure to adhere to the guidelines on donations was attributed to capacity gaps within entities such as inadequate staff, the emergency nature of the activities during the lockdown, and the need to adhere to Ministry of Health SOPs in regard to the spread of the virus.

I advised the Accounting Officers to adhere to the guidelines regarding the management and distribution of Government inventories and in future develop alternative accountability mechanisms such as direct involvement of the internal audit function in the distribution of inventories as a way of confirming occurrence. This can be supplemented through the use of photographic evidence at the point receiving the items in such unique situations.

**3.8**

### Management of quarantine centres

I observed that 45 entities utilised some of the Covid-19 funds on the management and operation of quarantine centres where patients, contacts and returnees were kept for close monitoring and/or treatment. I undertook procedures to ascertain how these quarantine centres were managed and noted a number of anomalies such as; insufficient number of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), lack of inspections prior to accreditation, lack of amenities including running water and power, and failure to use the centres. Details are in **Appendix IX.**

The Accounting Officers explained that the failure to properly manage the quarantine centres was due to inadequate funding for the acquisition of supplies including PPEs, lack of trained staff to manage the centres, and space constraints.

Failure to properly manage the centres may have hampered efforts towards the containment of the spread of the pandemic.

I advised the Ministry of Health to put in place a committee to identify the requirements of the different quarantine centres and come up with measures to address them taking into consideration that Covid-19 is still an ongoing challenge in the country.

**3.9**

### Recruitment of health workers

According to the approved work plan Ministry of Health was supposed to undertake the recruitment, training and remuneration of 250 health workers to handle the expected surge in the Covid-19 cases. The Ministry recruited 235 workers (94%) who were subsequently appointed by the Health Service Commission, which was a commendable performance given the circumstances. As at the close of the financial year 2019/2020, the Ministry had spent a sum of UGX.864,072,760 on salaries for these health workers.

I reviewed the recruitment process for the health workers and noted that formal appointment and deployment letters were issued to staff after their third month of service, i.e. in June 2020.

---

The lack of appointment letters creates ambiguity regarding the terms and conditions of employment and what is expected of either party under the contract, which may in turn lead to conflicts or disagreements.

The Accounting Officer attributed the delay to issue formal appointment letters to the emergency situation occasioned by the pandemic which called for the immediate deployment of staff in order to deal with the Pandemic.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that there are contractual undertakings clearly spelling out the terms and conditions prior to engagement of any individual in order to safeguard Government against any eventuality.

### 3.10 Diversion of funds

Paragraph 8.5.2 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 provides that implementation of the budget shall strictly follow work-plans, procurement plans and recruitment plans approved by Parliament.

I noted that UGX.10.574bn was diverted by six (6) entities and utilised on items other than those for which the funds had been disbursed. **Appendix X** refers.

The Accounting Officers explained that this was necessitated given the emergency nature of the activities to which the funds were diverted.

Irregular diversion of funds undermines the budgeting process and affects the monitoring and accountability of such funds. Diversion of funds may also affect the achievement of the objectives for which the funds were released.

I noted the Accounting Officerâ€™s response and advised them to ensure that appropriated funds are used strictly for activities that are in the approved work-plans.

### 3.11 Management of distribution of food relief items

I observed short comings in the management and distribution of food relief items under the Office of the Prime Minister as highlighted below:



- Items valued at UGX.55.8bn that were distributed under the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) lacked sufficient evidence of acknowledgement to enable me verify the recipients. The lack of sufficient accountability for distributed items creates mistrust among the population as well as raising the risk of abuse of the process. This was attributed to the potential risk of spreading the virus through sharing of items like distribution lists and pens which was discouraged by Ministry of Health.



- Quality checks by UNBS on a sample of 14,069 metric tonnes of maize flour and 8,547 metric tonnes of dry-beans established that 2,615 metric tonnes (18%) of maize flour and 2,017 metric tonnes (23%) of dry-beans intended for distribution by Office of the Prime Minister did not pass quality checks.

This was caused by lack of clear guidelines to the suppliers on the quality standards expected by the inspecting body.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that there is detailed and accurate accountability for all items that were distributed to the population and in future ensure

10

---

that items are checked for quality before they are received and distributed in the event that the need for distribution of food relief items re-occurs.

### Overall Audit Conclusion

Government took measures to respond to the pandemic and audit observed commendable performance where 98% of the budgeted funds were utilised, 95% was banked intact as per guidelines, 99% of the entities had work plans, 94.5% of activities were well quantified. Of these 94% of the activities were fully implemented

A number of shortcomings were however also noted in the way entities implemented the measures. These included under absorption of funds of 2%, use of cash at source of 5%, non- compliance with procurement laws, 0.5% of the funds were not accounted for, 4% of the funds were diverted, inadequate valuation of in-kind donations and poor management of quarantine centres. These were mainly attributed to the emergency conditions under which the entities were operating and the lockdown measures instituted by Government to control the spread of the disease. I therefore advised Government to put in place measures to raise preparedness for the management of emergency situations.
