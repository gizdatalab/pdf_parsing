# REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MULTINATIONAL LAKE VICTORIA MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT PROJECT (MLVMCTP), ADF LOAN 2100150036246

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021**

## THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

**Opinion**

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 which comprise of the Statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 30 th June 2021, Statement of Fund Balances, Statement of Comparative Budget and Actual Amounts, Statement of Cash flows, Statement of ADB Special Account Movement, Statement of ADB loan balances together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the project financial statements present fairly in all material respects, the financial performance of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 and the Fund balances for the year ended 30 th June 2021 in accordance with the Project Funding guidelines and accounting policies stated in the notes to the financial statements.

## Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement’s section of my report. I am independent of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) project, ADF loan 2100150036246 in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

## Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.

## 1.0 Implementation of the Approved Budget

On the 24 th of April 2020, Parliament approved the annual budget for MDAs and LGs including their projects that contained the specific resource envelope allocated to each vote

---

to implement agreed on outputs. Subsequently, the PS/ST issued a Budget Execution Circular that communicated the budget strategy, policy, and administrative issues to guide the budget implementation for the financial year 2020/2021.

During my overall risk assessment exercise, I noted that entities and Projects are still experiencing challenges in implementing the budgets approved by parliament and policy guidance’s issued by PS/ST, which has continued to affect the performance and credibility of the budget negatively. These challenges include; lack of strategic plans that are aligned to the National Development Plans, underperformance of revenue, implementation of off- budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.

I am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of several activities. Consequently, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic. It is against this background that the implementation of the budget was again considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning for the current audit year.

The Government of the Republic of Uganda (GoU) represented by Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) entered into a loan agreement not exceeding the equivalent of Ten Million Two Hundred and Ten Thousand Units of Account (UA 10,210,000), equivalent to USD Fourteen Million, Four Hundred Thousand ($14,400,000) with African Development Fund on 19th January 2018, to finance all the foreign currency cost of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport Project. The Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) is the implementing Agency for the project at the Regional Level; while the Ministry of Works and Transport for Uganda is the National Executing Agency (NEA) at the National Level.

The overall project objective is to address the maritime transport and navigation safety challenges on Lake Victoria and contribute to the provision of safe, efficient transport links, and to safely conduct fishing activities that are essential to achieving the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development. The project is expected to further improve the quality of life for the people living within the Lake Victoria Basin, which is in line with the funder’s focus area. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Works and Transport as the National Executing Agency.

According to the Government of Uganda (GoU) Approved Estimates for 2020/2021, the project the project expected to receive UGX.25,186,627,000 and UGX.1,000,000,000 from ADB/F and Government of Uganda respectively. The Project received UGX.2,772,904,000 and UGX.970,000,000 to fund its activities. I undertook a review of the implementation of the Project activities for the year.

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following:

|| indicate that the project was  receive UGX.25,186,627,000 and UGX.1,000,000,000 from ADB/F and Government of Uganda respectively. However, the Statement of Cash Receipts and Payments by Category showed that the Project received only UGX.2,772,904,000 and UGX.970,000,000 from the Fund and Government of Uganda respectively. expected to This resulted into 86% combined revenue shortfall of UGX. 22,443,723,000 comprising UGX.22,413,723,000 from ADB/F and UGX. 30,000,000 from Government of Uganda. The shortfall resulted into non-performance of some anticipated activities including procurement for nine (9) rescue boats and one (1) firefighting boat and construction works for the SAR Centers and women fish drying sheds. Management explained that ADB funds are disbursed either to Special Account with an approved work plan or by direct payments to contractors and consultants. further explained that activities were delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic restriction of movement of the suppliers of goods and services and officers contracting the disease.

| **1.2** | **Under absorption of funds** According to the Statement of Cash Receipts and Payments by Category, the project had a total of UGX.2,880,932,576.08 available for spending during the year and this represented the opening balance of UGX.108,028,576.08 and total disbursements from the Fund amounting to UGX. 2,772,904,000 comprising disbursements to the Loan Special Account (UGX.1,526,850,000) and direct payments (UGX.1,246,054,000). However, the Cash flow Statement shows that out of the available funds , a total of only UGX.2,118,494,681.98 was spent resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.762,437,894.10 representing 26.5% of the funds available. Out of the UGX.970,000,000 availed by GoU, only UGX.939,530,000 was spent resulting into the balance of UGX.30,470,000 (3.1%) to be swept back to the Consolidated Fund. under-absorption resulted into non-performance of some anticipated activities.

## Other Information

The Accounting Officer of MoWT is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other

---

information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

## Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, ADB guidelines and the basis of accounting described in the notes to the financial statements, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Project’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246, and using the ADB Guidelines and Government of Uganda Regulations, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Project’s financial reporting process.

## Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

---

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Project’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246to fail to deliver its mandate.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation and Funding Requirements section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

---

## Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation and Funding Requirements

In accordance with Section 13 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of the Project with specific matters in key legislations and the Financing Agreement requirements. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

**2.0**

## Failure to open a local currency account for local expenditure

Condition 5.01 (a) of the Loan Agreement required opening of a US Dollar denominated Special Account to receive the loan proceeds while condition 5.01 (b) required opening of a local currency account in the Bank of Uganda to receive proceeds from the special account for local expenditure and project operations.

However, the examination of the special account bank statements indicated that a local currency account was not opened and hence all local expenditure and project operations were made from the special account in foreign currency.

This practice contravenes the Loan Agreement and good practice of separating loan proceeds from the day to day operational transactions.

Management indicated that they were in the process of opening a local currency account.  
I advised management to expedite the process of opening up a local currency account and funds meant for local project operations transferred to it in accordance with the requirements of the ADB/F financing agreement.

**3.0**

## Failure to prepare an annual work plan and budget for the project activities

Section 4.2.2 of the project appraisal report of October 2016 requires each National Executing Agency (Ministry of Works and Transport) and Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) to prepare an annual work plan and budget for implementing program activities taking into account the specific program components and activities to be implemented “jointly” and at the “national” levels. The plans and budgets are required to be submitted to the line ministries of partner states for approvals and for onward transmission to LVBC for consolidation. The consolidated work plan and budget is required to be submitted to the Bank by the LVBC.

Contrary to the above requirement, I noted that the Project Implementation unit (PIU) at the Ministry of Works and Transport did not prepare an annual work plan and budget for the financial year under review.

There was no guidance for the implementation of project activities during the financial year.

Management explained that the project activities in the work plan for the financial year 2019/20 had not been fully implemented due to covid-19 pandemic challenges.

---

I advised Management to always prepare a work plan and budget for implementing program activities annually and to roll over any activity that remains outstanding in the prior year work plan and budget into the following year’s work plan and budget.

**4.0.**

## Delayed delivery of boats and an ambulance

On 2 nd October 2020, the Ministry entered into a contract for the supply of nine marine rescue boats and one fire-fighting boat at a contract price of UGX.5,033,483,516 (VAT exclusive). The contract was to run for a period of six months up to 2 nd April 2021. Clause GC 13.1 of the contract required the contractor to present a performance security amounting to 10% of the contract price (UGX.503,348,351).

Similarly, the Ministry entered into a contract agreement on 15 th October 2020 for supply of one ambulance boat at a cost of UGX 1,383,634,216. The contract was also to run for a period of six months up to 15 th April 2021.

The boats and the ambulance had not been delivered by the time of audit in September 2021.

The contractors may not deliver the boats and the ambulance forcing the Ministry to incur costs of redoing the procurements. In addition, the Ministry still lacks capacity to carry out all the rescue operations and firefighting operations that may arise.

Management explained the delivery of boats and the ambulance was affected by the Covid 19 pandemic which affected businesses globally and that as a result the timelines for delivery were extended to December 2021.

I advised Management to engage the contractors to ensure that the boats are delivered by the extended timeline.

## GOU Counterpart Funding

I confirm that the Government of Uganda largely fulfilled its counterpart funding obligation for the project for the year ended 30 th June 2021.

## REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE INTERNAL CONTROL OF MULTI NATIONAL LAKE VICTORIA MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT PROJECT

**(MLVMCTP), ADF LOAN 2100150036246 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021**

**Opinion**

I have audited the financial statements of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246, and reviewed the Internal Control procedures relevant to the generation of accounting information presented in the financial statements, and those relevant to control over project finances and the safeguard of its assets. I obtained all the information and explanation I considered necessary for the audit.

In my opinion, Project Management maintained an adequate internal control system for the preparation of reliable financial statements, control over finances and safeguard of the project assets during the year ended 30 th June 2021.

## Management Responsibility

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgment are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of internal control structure policies and procedures.

## Auditor’s Responsibility

My examination was made in accordance with ISSAIs and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records, verification of assets and liabilities and such other auditing procedures I considered necessary in the circumstances.

For the purpose of this report, I have classified the significant internal control structure policies and procedures in the following categories:-

- Control over the preparation of withdrawal applications for funds from the project account
- Bank and cash Purchases and payments,
- Monitoring, evaluation and reporting.

For all the internal control structure categories listed above, I obtained an understanding of the design of the relevant policies and procedures and whether they have been placed in operation, and I assessed control risk.

**Opinion**

I have audited the special account statement of the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 for the year ended 30 th June 2021 which is set out in the financial statements.

In my opinion, Project Management complied in all material respects with ADB rules and procedures and that the Special Account Statement for the the Multinational Lake Victoria Maritime Communications and Transport (MLVMCT) Project, ADF Loan 2100150036246 for the year ended 30 th June 2021 presents fairly in all material respects the account transactions and the closing balance as at 30 th June 2021.

## Management Responsibility for the Special Account Statement

Project management is responsible for preparation of the special account statement and its fair presentation in accordance with the requirements of the Government of Uganda regulations and ADB guidelines. Management is also responsible for designing and implementing internal controls relevant to the preparation of the special account statement that is free from material misrepresentation, whether due to fraud or error and selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

## Auditor’s Responsibility

My responsibility is to express an opinion on the Special Account Statement based on my audit. I conducted the audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and the ADB guidelines on auditing. Those standards and guidelines require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Special Account statement is free from material misstatements. I believe that the audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
