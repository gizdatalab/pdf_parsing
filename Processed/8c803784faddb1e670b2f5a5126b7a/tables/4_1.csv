Further, Section 15 (3) requires that an Accounting Officer shall commit the budget of a vote, based on the annual cash flow plan issued under this section. A review of the entity’ revenue performance revealed the following:  The entity had a budget appropriation of UGX 542,517,023,289 during the year. However, UGX 540,966,204,691 was warranted resulting in a budget shortfall of UGX 1,550,818,598 (representing 0.3%).  Out of the amount warranted of UGX. 540,966,204,691, UGX. 540,956,699,691 was spent by the entity resulting in unspent balance of UGX 9,505,000 representing an absorption level of 99.9% The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the Consolidated Fund account.","I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoFPED to ensure the budgeted funds are fully released, to enable the Fund to implement its planned activities."
