4.1.5;"I assessed the implementation of thirty seven (37) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of one hundred and sixty eight (168) activities worth UGX.779.621Bn and noted that; Four (4) outputs with seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX 543.224Bn were fully implemented. That is all the seven (7) activities within these outputs were fully implemented.  Thirty (30) outputs with one hundred and fifty seven (157) activities worth UGX.236.397Bn were partially implemented. Out of the one hundred and fifty seven (157) activities, the entity fully implemented forty seven (47) activities, and seventy two (72) activities were partially implemented while thirty eight (38) activities remained unimplemented.  Three (3) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX.0.0Bn were not implemented. That is none of the four (4) activities was implemented at all because budgeted funding was not availed.
