4. Uganda Wildlife Authority. Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of a total budget of UGX.119.469Bn, UWA received a total of UGX124.820Bn, representing 105% of the budget. However, the Authority spent only UGX.88.607Bn, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.30.862Bn representing an absorption level of 74.17%. As a result, I noted that of the 114 quantified activities worth UGX.54.37Bn that I assessed during the audit, 70 activities representing 61.4% were fully implemented, 23 activities representing 20.2% were partially implemented, while 21 activities representing 18.4% was not
;;;implemented. Under absorption of availed funds implies failure to fully implement all planned activities which
;;;negatively impacts service delivery.
;;; It was observed that the Authority had outstanding payables of UGX.25.454Bn, reported in the statement of
;;;financial position, out of which UGX.8.111Bn were gratuity for staff not yet due and balance of UGX.17.343Bn
;;;relates to trade payables, insurance claims payable, Gorilla levy payable and revenue share to the communities.
;;;This despite the fact that the Authority had the cash resources which could have been utilized to settle the payables.
;;;Delayed settlement of outstanding payables exposes government to a risk of costly litigation.
;;; I noted that there were several ongoing cases of claims on land in the gazetted areas under the management of
;;;Uganda Wildlife Authority, as evidenced by active court cases in some of the National Parks namely: Lake Mburo
;;;National Park, Mt. Elgon National Park, Semiliki National Park and Matheniko Bokora. This was attributed to
;;;increased encroachment to the National park land. There is urgent need to resolve these cases to prevent loss of
;;;gazetted land areas that could affect wildlife conservation.
;;; I noted that the Authority did not have an approved comprehensive management plan to manage the invasive and
;;;exotic plant species problem that has covered an average of 30% of the surface areas of Queen Elizabeth, Lake
;;;Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks. The invasive species contracts the grazing areas
;;;for herbivores animals and affect the rangeland and environmental quality that consequently reduce wildlife
;;;population of grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda Kobs.
;;; I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.61.169Bn were not executed as of 30th June 2022. This was
;;;attributed to delays in procurement processes and partly due to effects of COVID-19 that affected the
;;;implementation by the Authority that was operating a contingency budget that had scaled down on the capital
;;;investments. Failure to implement planned procurements leads to non-provision of planned services.
;;; Over the last three years, UWA procured and installed three (03) different Accounting Systems, namely: The Sun
;;;System, Microsoft Dynamics GP and the Microsoft Business Central System. The frequency of change of systems
;;;was unjustifiably high and costly to Government. I observed that there were weaknesses in systems change over,
;;;since management did not properly identify challenges that would require a switch to a new accounting package.
;;;Such a practice leads to wasteful expenditure on systems acquisition and no value for money.
