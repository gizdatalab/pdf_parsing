" I reviewed the loan portfolio and noted that an average of 53% and 52% of impaired loans was registered in the financial years 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively, while there has been a progressive increase to 71% in the financial year ended 30 th June 2022. Such increases imply that there are more loans that are likely to become uncollectable and therefore leading to loss to government.  I noted weaknesses in the IT systems which include; o There was no evidence of systems ownership o The two systems operated by the entity were not integrated or not automatically sharing information o There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation. o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy and risk register at the entity. o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy with other systems. 2014.";;;
33. National Population Council (NPC) Unqualified Opinion;;;The entity was supposed to receive UGX.16.191Bn out of which UGX.12.742Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.449Bn. The shortfall represents 21.3% of the approved budget. As a result some activities planned for the year, were not implemented, which negatively impacts on service delivery. 

;;; The entity had an approved staff structure of 97 positions, out of which 74 (76%) positions were filled, leaving 23
;;;(23.7%) positions not yet filled. Staffing gaps constrain the entity in implementing its mandate effectively.
;;; NPC staff were paid a salaries amounting to UGX.4.01Bn for the F/Y 2021/2022 off the IPPS and yet the human
;;;resource system was procured for payroll management. This creates an opportunity for payment of ineligible staff
;;;and creation of non-existent staff/pensioners.
;;;" I carried out a review of management of IT investments at the entity and noted that;"
;;; Three (3) IT systems /equipment acquired at UGX.415Mn had no clearance from NITA-U, while IT
;;;systems/equipment costing UGX.342Mn did not have clearance from MoFPED.
;;; Two (2) Multi-year system implementation projects worth total of UGX.342Mn did not have approval from
;;;Parliament.
;;; The National population data bank and the KMIS systems costing UGX.342Mn were not being utilized by NPC.
;;; Absence of ICT governance structures hampers formulation of appropriate ICT policies, strategies and may lead
;;;to misalignment of IT investments with the overall strategic objectives.
PPDA had an approved budget of UGX.23.28Bn out of which UGX.19.52Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.76Bn which represents 16.15% of the approved budget. The deficit in the budget negatively impacted service delivery.  34. Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA) Unqualified Opinion;;;
