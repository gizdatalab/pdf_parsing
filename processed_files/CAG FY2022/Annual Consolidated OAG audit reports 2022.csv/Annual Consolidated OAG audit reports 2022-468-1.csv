o Parliament appropriated UGX.62.07Bn out of UGX.227.47Bn (27.3%) to the Contingencies Fund, leading to a deficit of UGX.165.40Bn (72.7%). o Due to an upsurge of COVID-19, additional funds were appropriated via a supplementary budget of UGX.228.30Bn, making a total of UGX.290.37Bn. o Out of the total warrants of UGX.290.37Bn, only UGX.72.06Bn (24.8%) was released to the MDAs for emergencies, leading to a total deficit of UGX.219.33Bn (75.5%). The continued failure to appropriate funds in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), is an indicator of noncompliance and defeats the intentions of the law. ;;;
31. Treasury Operations Unqualified Opinion;;; The Treasury Operations had an initial approved budget of UGX.15.094Tn which was later revised to
;;;UGX.17.863Tn. Out of the revised Budget, UGX.17.391Tn was warranted, out of which, UGX.13.959Tn was utilized by the entity resulting into an unutilized balance of UGX.3.432Tn representing a performance level of 80.26%. Audit however noted that the entity remained with a total of UGX.4.661Tn as payables at year end.
;;;
;;; There are was a significant change of the reported payables from UGX.2.345Tn to UGX.4.583Tn resulting into
;;;an increase of UGX.2.238Tn representing 95%. The significant increment in the liabilities was due to the
;;;International Court of Justice ruling in favour of Democratic Republic of Congo to a tune of UGX.1.228Tn and the
;;;assumption of Uganda Telcom liabilities of UGX.0.028Tn.
;;; Audit noted that as regards the management of Boards for Corporations and companies in which Government has
;;;shareholding, there were no clear guidelines, policies or regulations for the management, appointment, evaluation
;;;or determination of such Boards.
;;; The government is defaulting on the payment of an outstanding balance of USD.889,411.24 (UGX.3,343Bn)
;;;out of a total USD.1,659,450.22 as a 10 th Instalment for 51 callable shares from African Development Bank
;;;(ADB). Failure to pay-up on callable shares puts the country at a risk of losing paid up shares and the corresponding
;;;callable shares in the Bank.
Out of the approved budget of UGX.154.18Bn for capital expenditure, Emyooga grant and other recurrent expenditures, UGX.146.85Bn was realized and UGX.125.65Bn was spent, leaving UGX.21.2Bn unspent which represents 14.4% of the realized funds. Unspent funds represent services not delivered. A total of UGX.1.44Bn was disbursed as additional capitalization to the existing EMYOGA SACCOs when they had not made recoveries of above 70% of the first seed capital disbursed, as evidenced by the loan disbursement and recovery schedules submitted by the respective SACCOs. This can lead to disbursements to SACCOs that are already at default. The loan portfolio of the company has grown from UGX.105Bn in 2020 to UGX.146Bn over the three years representing a 39% growth. However, a total of UGX.3.7Bn was disbursed to several clients without undertaking adequate loan appraisal documentation, hence an increase in default risk exposure as well as potential loss to government.    32.
