The College budgeted to collect NTR of UGX 0.483Bn during the year under review. Out of this, UGX 0.626Bn was collected, representing a performance of 129.5% of the target. The College received UGX 1.49Bn Government support out of the budgeted amount of UGX 2.72Bn, resulting in a shortfall of UGX 1.23Bn. The shortfall represents 45.1% of the approved budget. I noted that out of the total available funds of UGX 2.383Bn, a sum of UGX 2.375Bn was spent representing an absorption level of 99.7%.  I noted that seven (7) outputs with nine (9) activities worth UGX 1.44Bn were fully implemented while one (1) output with one (1) activity worth UGX 0.002Bn was partially implemented. I noted that the College strategic plan was still in draft form as it lacked approval by both the Governing Council and National Planning Authority. A review of the approved establishment structure revealed that out of the 83 approved positions, only 46 had been filled leaving 46 positions vacant.      20.
