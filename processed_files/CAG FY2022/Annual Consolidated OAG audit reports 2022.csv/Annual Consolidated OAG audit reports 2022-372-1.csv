"      Out of the approved budget of UGX.196.099Bn expected from the Donors, UGX.145.885Bn was available for spending, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.50.214Bn (26%). Further, of the expected UGX.0.700Bn GOU co-funding, UGX. 0.699Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.001Bn representing 99.8% performance. Out of the total available funds of UGX.145.885Bn, UGX. 84.520Bn was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.61.365Bn representing an absorption level of 57.93%. This affected implementation of activities. I sampled four (4) activities worth UGX 63.061Bn and assessed the extent to which these had been implemented. Out of the 4 activities; two (2) activities were partially implemented, while 2 activities were not implemented. This affected service delivery. I noted a number of shortcomings from my inspections such as delayed works, incomplete structures, un-utilised agro processing facilities all of which affected service delivery. I noted avoidable expenditure on the procurement of M-Cash Uganda Limited as an E-Voucher management agency at a cost of UGX.6.8Bn. In addition, there was delayed operationalization of the M-cash electronic payment platform for eight (8) months due to the failure by MAAIF to integrate this financial inclusion system to the NITA‘s payment gateway in time leading to farmers and agro dealers failure to transact during this period. There was failure to refund unutilized balances to farmers, Agro-dealers and MAAIF by UBA to the tune UGX.8.8Bn on termination of their contract. 1.
