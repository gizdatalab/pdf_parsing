  Out of the received grant of USD.4.5Mn, only USD.0.744Mn (UGX.2,710Bn) was expended reflecting unspent funds of UGX.8,889,891,079 and USD.1,191,819.40 held in the BOU UGX and USD bank accounts respectively, resulting into underperformance of 83.7%. This resulted into partial or non-implementation of planned activities, which in turn delays service delivery. The project implementation had been delayed and some planned project activities such as Procurement of firefighting and personal protection equipment, undertaking studies on Invasive species and developing their respective management plans, and Procurement of road construction equipment (3 graders, 2 excavators, 2 bulldozers, 2 water bowsers, 2 tippers) were not implemented. Failure to absorb Development Partner funds implies project objectives have not been met. 5. UWA-IFPA-CD Project Unqualified Opinion;;;

6. UWA-SIDA Project 2022 Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the received grant of USD.860,299 only UGX.557,053,138 (USD.135,324.7) was expended leading to unspent funds of UGX.2,317,274,301 and USD.39,857.23 held in the UGX and USD bank accounts respectively, resulting in underperformance of 82.3%. The failure to utilize the released funds resulted into non-implementation of several planned activities.

  Out of the total receipts of UGX.3.85Bn received during the financial year, UGX.3.522Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.328Bn representing an absorption level of 91%. As a result some planned activities were not implemented. The unspent funds were held in the Institute’s bank account. The Uganda Wildlife Authority donated 30 acres of land in Rwenjubu Kasese District, to Uganda Wildlife Research and Training Institute but there was no land title to confirm ownership. This land was not being utilised by the Institution although Management indicated that UWRTI had secured funding through CEDP for the construction of a centre for excellence. In the absence of a land title, the land is prone to encroachment. Unqualified 7. Wildlife Research and Training Institute Opinion;;;

8. Uganda Wildlife Education Conservation Centre (UWEC). Unqualified Opinion;;;The Centre received total revenue of UGX.14.369Bn (including self-generated revenue of UGX.2RC.169Bn) during the financial year. Out of the total available funds for the year, the Centre spent UGX.10.9Bn resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.3.469Bn representing an absorption level of 75.86%. As a result, I noted that of the 59 quantified activities worth UGX.5.87Bn that I assessed, 25 activities representing 42.4% were fully implemented, 27 activities representing 45.8% were partially implemented, while 7 activities representing 11.9% were not 
;;;implemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.
