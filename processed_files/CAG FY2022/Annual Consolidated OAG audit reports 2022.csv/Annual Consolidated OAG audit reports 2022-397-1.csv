 I noted that despite the company making a profit of UGX.1,638,416,786 in the year under review and UGX.1,470,968,482 in the previous financial year, the company did not propose any dividend pay-out as a form of return on Government investment. I further noted that the Company has not paid any dividends to Government for the previous years.;;;
3. Kiira Motors Corporation. Unqualified Opinion;;; KMC had an approved budget of UGX.218,200,839,000 which was all availed during the year. Out of this, the entity absorbed UGX.65,215,742,112 which was only 30% of the funds availed. This affected the implementation of planned activities (all the three outputs planned for the year were partially implemented).
;;;
;;; The entity had an un-recovered long outstanding receivable of UGX.8,489,374,688 from Makerere University which
;;;remained outstanding for more than eight years.
;;; The entity bought 518 hectares of land without notifying Uganda Land Commission and without obtaining approval
;;;for purpose of the land from the Uganda land Commission which contravened Section 49 (b) of the Land Act. I
;;;further observed that part of this land had encumbrances in form of squatters.
;;; KMC does not have adequate ICT business continuity and disaster recovery measures in the event of ICT systems
;;;failure and disruptions.
   I reviewed the statement of cash flows and noted figures in several account areas totalling to UGX.11Bn that were inconsistent with the statement of financial performance and were not supported with ledgers. I could not carry out reconciliations between the figures in the Statement of Financial Performance and those in the statement of cash flows due lack of proper underlying records. As a result, I could not verify the accuracy of the figures reported in the statement of cash flows and the statement of financial performance. A review of the summary of Budget Performance and the Statement of Appropriation Account (Based on Nature of Expenditure) indicates that the company spent UGX.1.213Bn on fixed assets during the financial year. However, a review of the additions in the schedule of fixed assets, indicated that UGX.2.025Bn was spent on asset additions during the year. This led to a discrepancy of UGX.812Mn between the summary of budget performance and the statement of appropriation, and the fixed asset schedule amount in respect of asset additions. I was not provided with ledgers to enable reconciliations of the amounts. These inconsistencies cast doubt on the accuracy of the information presented concerning the expenditure on fixed assets. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources, and rates charged at the entity level for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that out of the UGX.2.757Bn budgeted to be collected in the year under review, only UGX.0.295Bn was collected during the year representing 11% of the budget. Such a performance on NTR collection  Whereas a Trial Balance was presented in the financial statements as the basis for the account balances disclosed, I noted that the ledgers required to show the build-up of figures in the Trial Balance were incomplete. I further noted that the expenditure ledgers for Government subvention funds were inconsistent with the ones used to record expenditure of revenue from sales. I was therefore unable to confirm the correctness of the build-up of the figures in the Trial Balance, which was the basis for preparation and presentation of the financial statements. 4.
