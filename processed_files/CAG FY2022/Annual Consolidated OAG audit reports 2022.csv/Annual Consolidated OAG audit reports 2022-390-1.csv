13. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Funds Managed By Uganda Prisons Service (UPS);;; I noted that management had not understood the internal control procedure of using serially numbered payment vouchers. Manually written references have the inherent risk of human errors. When payments are not properly referenced, it becomes difficult to trace them to their supporting documentation.
;;;
;;; I noted variances between the expenditure recorded in the cashbook and the expenditure reported in the quarterly
;;;financial reports for the year ended 30th September 2021.
;;; I noted that the bank reconciliations from June 2021 to September 2021 were not correctly done. There were un-
;;;reconciling differences between the cashbook and the bank statement balances. In addition to this, the bank
;;;reconciliations provided for my review lacked evidence of review and approval by senior management.
;;; I noted that the project field staff allowances were not charged PAYE tax. Non-compliance with Income Tax Act
;;;may precipitate tax penalties from Uganda Revenue Authority, leading to financial loss for the project.
;;; I noted quarterly reports were not submitted to CDC on time. Late submission of reports may delay reporting,
;;;monitoring and evaluation of the project by the development partners.
      Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.28.663Bn, only UGX.28.640Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.023Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%%. As a result, I noted that of the five (5) quantified outputs worth UGX.28.64Bn assessed, all five (5) outputs were partially implemented. I assessed the delivery of services from implemented activities and noted delays in the construction of the multi- storeyed administration building and modification of the LDC printer building to accommodate a printery and store units. I also noted delays in the delivery of equipment like the production machines, tools and desktops for Lira campus. I noted delays in the marking of exams while a review of the completion rate of the Bar-course for students at LDC revealed that, on average, 92% of students admitted for the Bar Course successfully enrolled to study the course. I also noted that, on average, only 48% of students enrolled for the Bar Course completed the course within the one-year duration of study of the course. I reviewed the management of land and noted that LDC did not have land titles for seven (7) pieces of land. LDC did not utilise the five acres of land leased to LDC for 99 years to construct the Lira campus. There were significant encumbrances on the land located on Plots 1 and 4 Block 213, Kyadondo - Bukoto Mulimira Zone, Bukoto Parish, Nakawa Division, Kampala District, measuring approximately four (4) acres, which was fully occupied by squatters. I observed that domestic arrears increased by 95.3% from UGX.1.99Bn in the previous year to UGX.3.89 Bn as at 30th June 2022. I observed that LDC did not submit reports on their ongoing court cases to the Ministries of Justice and Finance as required by set guidelines. As a result, the nineteen (19) cases in which LDC is a litigant do not form part of the database and record of ongoing cases maintained by the Ministry of Justice. 14.
