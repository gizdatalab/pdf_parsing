;;; I observed that Plot 3927 Block 273 and plot 1774 block 255 at Kiruddu-Makindye in Kampala District where the Hospital
;;;premises and treatment plant has land titles registered in the names of Kampala Capital City Authority but not in the Hospital
;;;name which may result into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land.
;;; Included in reported payables balance of UGX.458,284,964. is a long-outstanding obligation of UGX.94,372,000. in respect of
;;;special meals served in FY 2019/20. I observed that management did not budget for the settlement of domestic arrears during
;;;the year under review. The Hospital is at risk of litigation and eventual payment of fines which may result into a financial loss.
;;;" Out of 830 approved positions; only 293 (35%) posts were filled, leaving 537 (65%) positions vacant. Included in the 537"
;;;vacant positions are critical positions such as Director surgical services, 36 consultants and 20 senior consultants.
;;; I observed that a total of three (3) IT systems were not being optimally utilized by the entity and the Integrated Hospital
;;;Management System (IHMS) running in the Hospital is not owned by the entity. In addition, the Hospital’s IHMS is not
;;;integrated or automatically sharing information with other systems. This leads to redundancies, duplications and inefficiencies.
;;; A review of drugs supply chain management revealed that on several occasions there were drug stock outs which left Kiruddu
;;;NRH without several essential, vital and necessary drugs. Drugs stock outs are potentially dangerous to the lives of patients.

"Out of the total expenditure budget of UGX.104.8bn, only UGX.85.7bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.19.1bn representing an absorption level of 82%. I assessed the implementation of a sample of forty three (43) activities with a total of one hundred twenty four (124) targets worth UGX.73.9Bn and noted that twenty three (23) activities with fifty one (51) targets and expenditure worth UGX.43.7Bn were fully implemented, twenty (20) activities with seventy three (73) targets worth UGX.30.2Bn were partially implemented. Out of the seventy three (73) targets, the entity fully achieved forty (40) targets; thirty two (32) targets were partially achieved, while one (1) target was not achieved. The Authority had long outstanding receivables from Ministry of Health and tenants to the tune of UGX.43,210,405,917 and UGX.131,298,624 respectively. Receivables represent idle assets which deny the entity availability of funds for prompt service delivery. I note that out of the four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 2.537 hectares held, one (1) piece of land located on Block 423, plot 13 in Busiro County (measuring approximately 1.619 hectares) had encumbrances in the form of encroachment by the local population. Encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the land and pose a risk of loss of land. I noted that NDA has four (4) IT systems which were neither integrated nor automatically sharing information amongst each other and with other government systems. 34. National Drug Authority.
