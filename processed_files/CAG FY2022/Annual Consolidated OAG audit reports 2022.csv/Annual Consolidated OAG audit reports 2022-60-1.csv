"Non-deduction of PAYE from Political leaders’ and Commissioners’ gratuity 3.1.4 I advised MoPS to ensure that deduction of PAYE from Political leaders’ and Commissioners’ gratuity automated IPPS. is in 19(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act provides that employment income mean any income derived by an employee from any employment and includes the following amounts whether of a revenue or capital nature; any wages, salary, leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime pay, fees, commission, gratuity, bonus or the amount of any travelling, entertainment, utilities, cost of living, housing, and medical or other allowances among others. I noted that in 43 LGs, Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners were paid gratuity of UGX.1,352,773,796 which was not subjected to PAYE computations and deductions on the IPPS leading to a loss of tax revenue of UGX.363,098,974 to government. Details are in Appendix 1 g. In 9 LGs Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners’ gratuity of UGX.439,505,102 was subjected to PAYE manually and UGX.112,440,114 was deducted and remitted to Uganda Revenue Authority. This practice complicates payroll management in LGs and creates inconsistencies where some LGs deduct the PAYE and others don’t. Details are in Appendix 1 g. The Accounting officers explained that computations were not activated in the IPPS to automatically deduct PAYE from Political leaders and commissioners’ Gratuity. My interaction with MoPS revealed that the error arose from the failure to distinguish between untaxable gratuity as per the Pensions Act and other taxable terminal benefits. MoPS has engaged the IPPS developer who required additional funding to rectify the error. Section";;;;

3.1.5 Inaccurate computation of pension and gratuity;;;;
(L-d) (1) & (2) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2021 on the computation of pension and commuted pension gratuity provides that pension is computed on the basis of (1/500)th of the annual salary at the time of retirement, multiplied by the total number of completed months of service using the formula P = LS x Sal/ (500) where P is Pension, LS is the length of Service in months, and Sal is the annual salary on retirement.
