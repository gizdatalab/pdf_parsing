;;;; UGX.785,971,835 that was deducted from staff salaries in respect of PAYE was not remitted to Uganda Revenue Law contrary
;;;;to the Income Tax Act.
;;;;" Out of the total receipts for pension for the financial year of UGX.11,059,648,812; UGX.11,009,275,358 was spent by the"
;;;;entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.50,373,454. Non-payment of pension leads to accumulation of arrears and
;;;;affects the livelihood of the pensioners.
;;;; UGX.57,495,264 was deducted from staff salaries in respect of Local Service Tax (LST) but was not remitted to the respective
;;;;local governments.
;;;; The Hospital had four (4) systems (HMIS, RX solution, IPPS and IFMS) which were not integrated or not automatically sharing
;;;;information with other systems.
;;;; Seventy-one (71) IT equipment that had exceeded the recommended useful life and recommended for decommissioning by
;;;;the board of survey had not been disposed of.
;;;; Splitting of procurements was observed during the procurement of oxygen analyser, paramagnetic analysis TCP/IT module,
;;;;condensate drain system-900, non-return valves, cylinders, trolleys and head bars and medical gas plant contrary to Section
;;;;58 (d) of the Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, 2003. I also observed that direct procurement was used without
;;;;justification.
;;;; I observed that the fridges that store cold chain medicines are housed in a non-ventilated room thereby retaining the heat
;;;;emitted from them which could damage the medicine and shorten the life span of the fridges.
42.;      Domestic arrears to the tune of UGX.1,384,692,974 paid during the year were recognized as part of the Statement of Financial Performance instead of the Statement of Appropriation Account contrary to the Financial Reporting Guide 2018. In addition, the amount was not disclosed in prior periods implying that they were not verified and reconciled with the balances on the database maintained by the Accountant General’s Office. Records for expenditure worth UGX.1,041,373,039 were missing on file at the time of audit. Pension and Gratuity worth UGX.387,436,568 was not paid to fifteen (15) pensioners and retirees. Out of the total warrants of UGX.74.580bn received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling UGX.72.183Bn resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2.394Bn representing an absorption level of 96.8%. Recruitments of staff were thus not undertaken as funds were released late in May 2022. I assessed the implementation of a sample of eight (8) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX.50.683bn and noted that seven (7) outputs with thirteen (13) activities and expenditure worth UGX.45.883bn were fully implemented while One (1) output with one (1) activity worth 4.8bn was partially implemented. Funds to the tune of UGX.1,177,688,181 were diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
