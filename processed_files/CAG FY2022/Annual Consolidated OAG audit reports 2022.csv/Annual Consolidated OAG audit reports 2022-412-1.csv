  I noted gaps in the implementation of the Parish Development Model, such as the absence of work plans, failure to fund SACCOs and contradicting PDM implementation guidelines. The Authority did not provide a sufficient budget for the settlement of court compensation/liabilities, and there were no criteria to guide the settlement of the arrears.;;;
20. Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (KIIDP). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the available funds of UGX.121.3Bn, UGX.101.8Bn was spent, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.19.5.Bn representing an absorption level of 84%. As a result, two outputs assessed with twelve (12) activities were partially implemented.
;;;
;;;  I noted that the project experienced challenges in implementing its activities which affected service delivery. I noted that out of the 459 titles bought by KCCA, only 64 land titles, representing 14%, had been processed and
;;;
;;;ownership transferred to KCCA.
;;; Out of 871 PAPs due for compensation under the KIIDP II Project, only 695 PAPs (80% on average) had so far
;;;been fully compensated as at the time of audit.
;;; The Project Management spent UGX.558,001,750 to settle interest accrued on delayed payment of Interim
;;;Payment Certificates (IPC) without justification.
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SECTOR;;;
1. Uganda Embassy in Abu Dhabi. Unqualified Opinion;;; The Embassy budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.1.59Bn during the financial year under review but realized UGX.0.044Bn only representing a performance of 3% of the target. The poor performance in NTR was partly attributed to unrealistic NTR projections due to the non-participation of the Embassy during the estimation of NTR by MoFPED.
;;;
;;; The entity budgeted to receive UGX.9.99Bn out of which UGX.9.38Bn was warranted resulting into 94% release of
;;;the budgeted funds. All the total warrants received were spent representing an absorption level of 100%.
;;; I assessed the implementation of a sample of five (5) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of nine
;;;(9) activities worth UGX.9.30Bn and noted that three (3) outputs with four (4) activities and expenditure worth
;;;UGX.4.93Bn were fully implemented.
;;; Two (2) outputs with five (5) activities worth UGX.4.37Bn were partially implemented. Out of the five (5) activities,
;;;the Embassy fully implemented two (2) activities and three (3) activities were partially implemented.
;;; Funds totaling to AED 40,300.42 (UGX.40,300,420) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were
;;;budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; The Embassy incurred a total expenditure on rescue accommodation of AED 201,000 (UGX.201,000,000). I noted
;;;that the Embassy is liable for any damage caused to the premises and for any nuisance acts that would arise
;;;following the admission of the distressed Ugandans and or any sickness which poses threats of potential contingent
;;;liabilities against GOU. This expenditure could have been avoided had the memorandum of understanding between
