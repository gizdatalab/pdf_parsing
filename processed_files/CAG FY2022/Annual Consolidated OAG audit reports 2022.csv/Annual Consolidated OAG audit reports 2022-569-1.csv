I noted that as part of Management’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements outlined on Page 6 of the Financial Statements, the Accounting Officer stated that a material uncertainty existed regarding the continued operation of Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners’ Council in the foreseeable future. Management’s judgement was informed by a letter Ref: MSD/135/165/01 dated 19th April 2021 from the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Public Service to all Accounting Officers. In this letter, guidance was provided on the modalities for management of public Institutions during the implementation of recommendations on the rationalization of Agencies and Public Expenditure. ;;;

Unqualified Opinion;;;The total loan disbursements from the 3 external funding agencies amounted to USD 34.427Million by 30th June 2022 representing 93% of the approved loan of USD 37 million.

 Whereas the project had a closing cash balance of USD 1,355,619.94, I noted the existence of outstanding claims from Excel Construction Ltd worth USD 1,414,640 and M/S ISDEFE (consultant) of Euros 88,437.97. This state of affairs affects the implementation of planned project activities which ultimately leads to delayed service delivery. There was a delay in the refurbishment of Busolwe General Hospital whose proposed scope was estimated to cost USD 5,532,792.38. This is despite the fact that the consultant so far has been paid EUROs 155,108 since December 2017. Delayed implementation of the project activities and disbursement of funds attracts commitment charges. In addition, these delays may result into cost overruns on the entire project.  30.

;;; I noted an encroachment of up to 11.30 hectares on the hospital land by over 2,000 families/households. In the circumstances,
;;;management is constrained in the effective delivery of the Hospital mandate.
;;; I noted that a number of critical medical equipment had been faulty for quite a long time without repair and or replacement
;;;of their spare parts rendering them redundant. An X ray machine had broken down since January 2022
;;; UGX.55,427,002 had not yet been paid to pensioners by the year end hence the pensioners’ livelihood is negatively affected.
