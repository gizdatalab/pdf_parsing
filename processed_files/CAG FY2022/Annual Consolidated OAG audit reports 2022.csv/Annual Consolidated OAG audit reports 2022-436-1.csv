"Chancery;Euros.21,750, rent for Warehouse; Euros 1,571, security costs and remobilization of workers. Delayed payments may also attract penalties from the Contractor and Consultant.  Whereas the country subscribes to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), it has incurred subscription arrears dating as far back as 2014 amounting to Euros 25,0139.34 an equivalent of UGX.101,183,684 as at 31 December 2021. There is a risk of prevention of certification and/or embargo on Uganda Seed exports to the European and other markets. Review of the board of survey report and physical inspection of the mission representation car, utility van and the ICT equipment revealed that though they are due for replacement due to high maintenance costs, this had not been effected. ";;;
60. Uganda Embassy in Paris. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.8.849Bn, UGX.8.203Bn was spent by the
;;;embassy resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.669Bn representing an absorption level of 93%. The unspent
;;;balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.  I observed that the mission did not have an approved and certified five-year strategic plan as required. There is
;;;a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which
;;;negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives.
;;; I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.37,684,240 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they
;;;were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
Although the Mission did not budget for None Tax Revenue (NTR) during the financial year 2021/2022, I noted that the Mission collected UGX.86.2Mn. Failure to budget for such NTR implies that there was no target upon which the Mission’s performance could be evaluated. Out of the appropriated budgeted of UGX.6.923Bn, only UGX.3.465Bn (representing 50% of the budget) was warranted leading to inability by the Mission to undertake the majority of the planned activities. I observed that the released funds could barely cover employee costs and the majority of the planned activities were not funded. I observed that although the Mission in Pretoria has over the years been employing local staff, there was no social security/gratuity scheme for such staff. It was further observed that although a local consultant was engaged, who compiled a valuation of how much is due for all staff (both current and those who exited), the current staff contracts have not been amended to cater for staff gratuity/social security, going forward. Such an omission exposes the Mission to risks of costly litigation and potential sanctions by the host nation.    Unqualified 61. Uganda Embassy in Pretoria. Opinion;;;
