"      I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity did not budget for NTR in the year under review; however, UGX.0.095Bn was collected. According to the approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.42.16Bn out of which UGX. 40.72Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX1.38Bn which is 3.3% of the approved budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.40.72Bn received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totaling UGX. 39.027Bn resulting in an un-utilized warrant of UGX.1.7Bn representing an absorption level of 95.8%. I assessed the implementation of a sample of eleven (11) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of seventy-two (72) activities worth UGX.39.03Bn and noted that; Two (2) outputs with eleven (11) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.49Bn were fully implemented. Nine (9) outputs with sixty-one (61) activities worth UGX.38.54Bn were partially implemented.

I noted that whereas the Centre had outstanding domestic arrears of UGX.3.7 Bn as at the end of the FY 2020/2021, did not budget for domestic arrears 1,820,651,696 was spent to settle the arrears. 49.
