I sampled three (3) outputs with a total of ten (10) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.239Bn for assessment and noted that all the outputs were fully quantified. Out of the three out-puts, one output with 5 activities worth UGX.0.68Bn was partially implemented while the remaining two outputs with 5 activities were not implemented at all. The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 after the deadline given for submission of the reports.   Opinion Unqualified;;;

;;;above the target. The Mission had a budget for GoU funding of UGX. 9.2Bn for the year however UGX 9.6Bn was warranted which was over and above the budget. All the warranted funds were utilized. 

;;;activity costing/budgets.
;;; The Mission had challenges in setting clear and appropriate performance indicators in the approved work plans
;;;and budgets. Some of the indicators used were generic and in some cases activities did not have performance
;;;indicators at all.
;;; I noted that the Embassy did not maintain a detailed register of risks and as such, there were no strategies and
;;;officers responsible for ensuring risks did not materialize.

I noted that the Mission finalized the preparation of the strategic plan for the period 2020/2021-2024/2025. However, this had not yet been approved by the National Planning Authority. I noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2.125Bn during the year under review, out of this, UGX.0.669 was collected representing 31.48%, resulting in a shortfall in performance of UGX. 1.456Bn (68.52%). The entity budgeted to receive UGX.7.46Bn and all of it was warranted resulting into 100% budget release. Out of these releases UGX.7.26Bn was absorbed leaving unspent balance of UGX.0.199Bn. I reviewed the extent of quantification of the seven (7) outputs with a total of thirty-four (34) activities and expenditure of UGX.7.46Bn and noted that none of the outputs was fully quantified. I noted that reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 quarters were submitted after the lapse of the deadline for submission.      42. Uganda Embassy in Kinshasa. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
