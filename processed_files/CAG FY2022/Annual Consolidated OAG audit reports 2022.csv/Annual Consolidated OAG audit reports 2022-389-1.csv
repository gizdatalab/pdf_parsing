;;;; The Judiciary did not have land titles for ninety-five (95) pieces of land measuring approximately 34.468 hectares.

12.;"        Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.101.30Bn, UGX.99.0Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1.4Bn representing an absorption level of 98.6%. As a result, I noted that out of the sixteen (16) planned outputs worth UGX.98.87Bn assessed; five (5) outputs were fully implemented, while eleven (11) outputs were partially implemented. I assessed the delivery of services from implemented activities and noted that the average time taken to issue passports increased to 22 days from 15 days in the prior year, 2020/2021. In addition, the processing and issuance of passports is more congested in the central region of Kampala compared to regional passport offices. There is a need to devise strategies to decongest Kampala Offices. I analysed data for 20,924 unissued passports and noted that 760 passports were still held at quality control, 2,435 passports had not been picked up for over six (6) months while 1,200 passports carried a status that showed that they were not ready for pickup, such as “for approval”, “for order generation” or for deferred capture. Such delays should be investigated and addressed to avoid discouraging applicants from picking up their passports. Only 32% of applicants who pay for express processing get their passports within two (2) days. Most applicants who pay for express services get their passports within 15 or more days. I assessed the extent of utilisation of smart gates at Entebbe International airport and observed only 0.05% of travellers in the financial year 2021/2022 were cleared using the smart gates. The underutilisation implies that the gates are not delivering the intended services to the citizens. I reviewed public land management and noted that NCIC’s annual land acquisition budgets were inconsistent with its strategic plans. The land acquisition processes did not comply with the PPDA laws, and some of the entity’s land was untitled. In addition, NCIC did not maintain a land register or capture the owned land in the asset’s register in the Government’s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), and the manual land register maintained does not comply with the format prescribed by the Accountant General. I reviewed IT systems management and noted that NCIC’s systems are not fully integrated, and the entity’s ICT governance had a number of shortfalls. For instance, there were no structures to oversee ICT implementation; no approved IT staff structure, internal audit did not review ICT systems and the entity’s business continuity policy, and the plan was not comprehensive enough to ensure the seamless continuation of business operations in the event of a disaster. I noted that the execution of the Turnkey contract for supplying an e-passports system and booklets did not fully comply with the contract terms. For instance, the construction of the NCIC personalisation building and a security printing factory has not yet commenced, migration of legacy data has not been done. The Uganda Prisons Service.
