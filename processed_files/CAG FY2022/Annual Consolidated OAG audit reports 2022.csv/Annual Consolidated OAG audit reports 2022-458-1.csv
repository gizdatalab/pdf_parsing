3. Competitiveness Enterprise Development (CEDP) COMPONENT 2-5 IDA CREDITS CR 52690-UG AND 65380-UG PROJECT ID P130471-2022 and Project Unqualified Opinion;;; The CEDP 2-5 project had budgeted for UGX.46.9Bn for the FY 2021/2022 to be spent on various outputs, however, only UGX.21.7Bn (46%) was utilised leading to under-absorption of UGX.25.2Bn (54%). Management attributed the poor absorption to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and disruptions in the supply chain that affected the implementation of planned activities and deliveries relating to procurements that had been undertaken.
;;;
;;; A total of USD.7,417,107 was spent by the project on various procurements for which there was no market price assessment. This was in contravention of Section 26 (4) of the PPDA Act. As a result, I was unable to confirm the basis on which the contract prices were determined.

;;;
;;; Project management awarded contracts to various suppliers for the supply of Motor Vehicles at a cost of
;;;USD.1,322,779 (equivalent to UGX.4.765Bn). A total of UGX.552.8Mn was paid to the suppliers as 20% advance
;;;payment while UGX.3.5Bn was used to secure letters of credit from Bank of Uganda in respect of the supplies.
;;;Contrary to the delivery schedules stated in the bidding documents of between 90 days to 120 days, the bidder
;;;quoted 3-6 months for the delivery of vehicles. After signing the contract, the delivery schedule was revised to 6-
;;;7 months due to disruptions in the supply chain caused by COVID-19. The vehicles had not been delivered by the
;;;time of reporting in December 2022. Failure to emphasise the delivery schedule could have disadvantaged other
;;;potential suppliers, who could have delivered earlier.
;;; CEDP set out to procure a Boat for the Uganda Wildlife Education Centre at a contract price of USD.695,000
;;;(equivalent to UGX.2.5Bn). As at the end of the year, the contract for the supply had expired, the final design had
;;;not yet been agreed on and no delivery had been made. The contract had consequently not been performed,
;;;leading to delayed service delivery.
;;; The Project effected payments amounting to USD.998,634 (equivalent to UGX.3.55Bn) in respect of the supply,
;;;installation and maintenance of the Uganda Wildlife Authority Integrated Financial Management System for which
;;;it was observed the contract implementation was marred by irregularities. Several modules purchased including
;;;payroll batch processing, recruitment, leave management, and time management were not fully functional and
;;;some were never utilized by the Authority. Lapses were noted in technical support management and failure by the
;;;system to integrate with the banks. It was also noted that consequently, the Authority abandoned the system and
;;;purchased another system to perform the same functionalities. No value for money was achieved in the
;;;procurement.
 MSC did not have a strategic plan aligned to NDPIII contrary to Section 13(6) of the PFMA, which requires that the annual budget shall be consistent with the National Development Plan, the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility 4. Microfinance Support Centre Limited 2020/21 Opinion;;;
