       The entity budgeted to collect NTR amounting to UGX.0.4Bn during the year under review. Out of this, UGX.0.2Bn was collected, representing a performance of 50% of the target. The entity was supposed to receive UGX.16.242Bn out of which UGX.15.621Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.621Bn. The shortfall represents 3.8% of the approved budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.15.621Bn received during the financial year UGX.15.211Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.41Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. I observed that the budgets for three (3) out of the six (6) outputs assessed were not supported by individual activity costing/budgets. I reviewed the performance indicators in the approved work plans and observed that the indicators used to measure performance for some activities would not provide the most appropriate measure of performance. In some cases, the indicators were generic and not specific to the activity while in other cases, management did not provide indicators. I noted that the High Commission did not maintain a detailed register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. As such, there were no strategies and officers responsible to mitigate the occurrence of such risks or to minimise the impact in the event that these risks materialised. A review of the statement of arrears of revenues on page 33 of the financial statements revealed that the Mission had cumulative arrears of revenue as at 30 June 2022 of UGX.112,630,169 however the same was not disclosed in the statement of financial position as receivables. 53.
