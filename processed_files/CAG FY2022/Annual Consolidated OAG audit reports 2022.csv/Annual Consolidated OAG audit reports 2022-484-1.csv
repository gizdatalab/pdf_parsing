   Out of the UGX.13.964Bn approved budget, only UGX.12.231Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.732Bn which represented 14.16% of the budget. As a result, three (3) outputs were partially implemented, hence negatively affecting public service delivery. The Authority did not have Land titles for four (4) pieces of land measuring 173.1 Acres in various parts of the country. This increases the risk of exposure to land grabbing and encroachment. I noted that contrary to Section 76 of UFZA Act 2014, which requires the Authority, in each year, within two months after the end of the financial year, to submit to the Minister, a statement of its activities in the preceding financial year, indicating any particular problems experienced by the Authority in that year in carrying out its objects and functions and making recommendations for resolving those problems and containing such other information as the Minister may direct, at the time of the audit in October 2022, the Authority had not prepared the report to the Minister for the financial year 2021/2022. Failure to produce and submit the required reports implies that the Minister and eventually Parliament to whom the annual report should be submitted by the Minister, did not assess the Authority’s performance. 6.
