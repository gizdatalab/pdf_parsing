  Council sued RAM Engineering and Stanbic Bank in a fraudulent case worth UGX 444,400,000 and the case was ruled in favor of UNMC. In the court ruling dated 4th October 2021, a garnishee order for refund of UGX.444,400,000 was issued against the respondent and the bank jointly and, or severally. I further noted that costs of the application were awarded to Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council (the Applicant). During the year under review, management made the necessary adjustments to the financial statements in the form of a receivable of UGX 444,400,000 and further disclosed a contingent asset in the form of interest and costs of the application. By the end of the year under review, funds were yet to be recovered as per the court ruling. On 3rd July 2020, management fixed a sum of UGX. 4,370,100,000 (UGX 4,000,000,000 and USD 100,000) with Standard Chartered Bank for 6 months with approval of the Governing Council vide resolution No. 11 under minute Ref: FC/16/26/06/2020 of the 7th full Council Virtual meeting held on 24th, 25th and 26th June 2020. Council earned interest income of UGX.163,429,767 that was credited on Standard Chartered Bank A/c No. 0102086768300 on 2nd January 2021. In addition, a sum of UGX 4.5bn was fixed on 21st June 2021 with the same bankers. I noted that the investment decisions were made without the guidance envisaged under a resource mobilization strategy. Furthermore, an investment register was not availed for audit verification.;;;
27. Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council. Unqualified Opinion;;; Due to Government reforms to rationalize Government agencies and public expenditure, there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt that the Council shall remain a Going Concern in the foreseeable future.
;;;
;;; I observed that whereas the Council’s potential revenue from members was UGX.2,336,864,180, only UGX.2,094,087,170 was
;;;budgeted for leaving UGX.242,777,010 unbudgeted for. The Council has not established a mechanism to collect and update
;;; information in the register of members so as to have reliable data to inform the revenue budgeting process. The Council collected Non – Tax Revenue of UGX.1,846,419,724 against a budget of UGX.2,094,087,170 leading to under
;;;collection of UGX.247,667,446.
;;; Contrary to section 32(1) of the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, 1998, that requires inspection/supervisory visits to be
;;;undertaken by the office of the Registrar at least once in every quarter of the year, I noted that inspection visits of health
;;;facilities were done once in the year and only 155 out of 1,523 health units were inspected. This can lead to complacency and
;;;compromise standards of health practitioners thus affecting the lives of patients.
    I noted that the council has an approved staff establishment of 28 positions. However, only 16 positions (representing 57%) were filled leaving 12 positions (43%) vacant. Under the circumstances, the existing staff are exposed to a risk of job-related stress which could negatively affect service delivery. Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners council had four (4) motor vehicles. The council did not have a policy on Motor Vehicle Management to guide the usage of its fleet of four (4) vehicles so as to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse. None of the four (4) vehicles owned by the council was inspected during the year under review. Under the circumstances, there is a risk of unforeseen mechanical failures that would expose the users of such vehicles to road accidents. I noted that the three (3) drivers employed by the Council had not undertaken additional training to obtain additional skills and were not subjected to annual medical examination to ascertain their fitness to drive.
