6. ADB –UCI East Africa's Centres of Excellence for Skills and Tertiary Education in Biomedical Sciences Unqualified Opinion;;;       The project expected to receive UGX.24.67Bn from Africa Development Bank/Fund (ADB/F) but only UGX.21.57Bn was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.10Bn (11.63%). Out of the total funds available of UGX.31,632,037,899, the project spent a total of UGX.24,381,361,189 resulting into unspent balance of UGX.7,250,676,710. The unspent balance majorly relates to uncompleted works (progress at 68%) for the Multi- Purpose building for cancer treatment and research. I noted the following anomalies regarding the construction of the Multipurpose building for which Roko Construction Ltd was the contractor: o o o o o Roko’s contract expired on 30th December 2020 and the Bank objected to any further extensions. Management cashed the performance bond of UGX8bn after Roko Construction failed to perform as per contract Inconsistencies in the valuation of completed works between Certificates 6 and 7 with Certificate 6 dated 7th September 2021 having the total value of certified works as USD.10,136,181 and Certificate 7 dated 24th May 2022 having a total value of works completed being USD.9,691,293 hence a decrease in the value of works of USD 444,887. An overpayment to Roko of USD.82,444. UCI did not claim for liquidated damages amounting to USD.68,137.4 from Roko Construction Limited even after the Institute became aware of Roko’s failure to deliver the contract. The consultant had been paid USD.913,983 (95%) of the contract sum yet the progress of construction works that the consultant was supervising was only 69% as at 30th June 2022. The contract for consultancy services for the design and construction supervision expired in April 2020 and had never been renewed. By 30.06.22, a total of USD.851,608 (80% of the contract sum) was paid to M/S MFI document solutions for the supply of ICT and Telemedicine Equipment. However, by at the time of the audit, the ICT equipment had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the KCB bank performance guarantee presented by the supplier to the institute expired on 31/03/2022. There is a risk of loss of funds A total of USD.483,000 (20% of the contract sum) was advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, at the time of the audit the MRI scanner had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the Stanbic Bank performance guarantee IG21293UG0101204 presented by the supplier to the Institute expired on 18th October 2022. USD.176,600 (20%) had been advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of Laboratory Furniture but at the time of the audit, the furniture had not yet been delivered.
