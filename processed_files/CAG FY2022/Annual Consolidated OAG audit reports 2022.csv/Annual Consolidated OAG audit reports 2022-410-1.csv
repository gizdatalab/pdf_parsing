16. Ministry of Local Government Unqualified Opinion;;;" Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.106.75Bn, only UGX.80.65Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.26.1Bn representing an absorption level of 75.6%. As a result, I noted that of the 40 quantified activities worth UGX.23.51Bn assessed; 16 activities representing 40% were fully implemented, 18 activities representing 45% were partially implemented, and 6 activities representing 15% were not implemented."
;;;

;;;
;;; The Ministry experienced challenges and delays in the implementation of some activities which affected service
;;;delivery.
;;; I observed that the MoLG did not make a budgetary provision for the settlement of court awards and compensation
;;;liabilities.
;;; I noted that the Ministry did not have approved selection criteria and allocation guidelines for the allocation of
;;;start-up funds to the beneficiary Local Governments. Consequently, the Ministry allocated an arbitrary start-up
;;;amount of UGX.50 million to each of the beneficiary local Governments irrespective of the differences in the
;;;requirements and size of the newly created administrative units.
;;; I noted that despite the Government commitment to co-fund projects to the tune of USD 22.89 million, only USD
;;;8.03 million was paid, leaving USD 14.86 million outstanding.
;;; I noted that the Ministry delayed operationalizing the Busega Market which delayed service delivery to the citizens.
;;; I noted that the Ministry did not carry out the induction of newly elected Local Government leaders in 110 Districts
;;;"and 19 Municipalities with their Lower Local Governments; only 10 Cities and 2 Districts of Mpigi and Mityana were"
;;;inducted using USMID and KOICA funding, while 23 Districts had induction of only the Higher Local Government
;;;Councils
;;; I noted that despite the submission of the cost implication two years after approval of the creation of cities, the
;;;cities are still operating on the budgets of Municipal Councils because they have not yet received funding for city
;;;status which hinders service delivery.
;;; I noted that several Districts and Cities had not constituted Service Commissions, while others were functional but
;;;not fully constituted.
;;; I noted that the Ministry did not have specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation. There was
;;;no approved IT risk management framework/policy, and risk register and there was no business continuity plan,
;;;contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014.
 I reviewed the budget performance for the project for the year and noted that out of the planned expenditure of UGX.53,057,264,072, only UGX 19,072,116,523 was spent, resulting in an absorption level of 36%. There is a risk that some key project activities may not be implemented by the end of the implementation period, which is 31st August 2023, resulting in repetitive project extensions.
