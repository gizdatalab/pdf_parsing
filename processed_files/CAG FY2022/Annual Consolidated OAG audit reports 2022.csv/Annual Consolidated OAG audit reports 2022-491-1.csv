;;; I noted that the Centre had total payables of UGX.2.51Bn, of which UGX 1.36Bn was due to the Consolidated Fund,
;;;while the balance of UGX.1.15Bn was due to other creditors as at 30th June 2022. Delays in settlement of
;;;outstanding liabilities could lead to costly litigation, in the event creditors decide to take such options.
;;;" A review of management of IT investments at the Centre revealed that;"
;;;o There were no approved specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.
;;;o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.
;;;o There was no approved business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information
;;;Security Policy 2014.
;;; Absence of ICT governance structures hampers formulation of appropriate ICT policies, strategies and real time
;;;upgrade of ICT interventions. In addition, it may lead to misalignment of IT investments with the overall entity
;;;strategic objectives.
;;; I noted that Government has taken a decision to merge Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre with
;;;Uganda Wildlife Authority with the aim of reducing public expenditure to facilitate efficient and effective service
;;;delivery. This process is in its final stages pending advice from Ministry of Public Service and Ministry of Tourism,
;;;Wildlife and Antiquities. This situation, along with other matters as set forth in Note 8.2.11, indicates the existence
;;;of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Agency’s ability to continue as a going concern.
;;;Management was advised to engage with the Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities and Uganda Wildlife Authority to
;;;adequately prepare for this transition.
The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.126.68 Bn during the year under review out of which only UGX.68.22 was collected, representing a performance of 54% of the target. Management attributed the low performance to the long period of closure and economic slowdown due to COVID-19. NTR/revenue shortfalls at the Treasury level, negatively affect the implementation of planned activities by the Government. The Ministry accumulated payables of UGX.4.3Bn of which UGX.3.1Bn relate to contributions to International Organisations and have been outstanding for over two financial years, exposing the Ministry to risks of not benefiting from membership and also being expelled from the organisation. The Ministry did not implement five planned procurements worth UGX.1.576Bn. This adversely affects service delivery. The Ministry developed a strategic plan for 2020/21 – 2024/25, but at the time of the audit, the plan had not been approved by the National Planning Authority, implying that the activities being implemented may not be aligned with NDP III.    9.
