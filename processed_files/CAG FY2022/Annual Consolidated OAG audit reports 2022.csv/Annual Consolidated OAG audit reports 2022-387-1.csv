;;;;budgeted for, and these cases continue to accrue interest which was standing at UGX.115,667,496,357 at the end
;;;;of the Financial year 2021/22.
;;;; I noted gaps in the criteria for management of court awards and compensations, including lack of guidance to
;;;;other MDAs and LGs on settlement of the awards, prioritisation of high-interest cases, estimation of contingent
;;;;liabilities etc.
;;;; I reviewed 88 court awards worth UGX.227,100,829,847 and noted that 44 cases with a total debt of
;;;;UGX.208,996,489,066 have remained outstanding for more than ten years. Of these, 24 cases are accumulating
;;;;interest at an average annual rate of 7%.
;;;; I noted the ministry lacked a comprehensive and accurate record of all cases.
;;;; I noted that out of the approved staffing level of 421, only 345 positions were filled (82%), leaving a staffing gap
;;;;of 76 positions (18%).
;;;; I reviewed the management of IT systems and noted that the entity doesnot record the IT systems in the assets
;;;;register. There were limited upgrades of IT systems and I noted a failure to operationalise interfaces for systems
;;;;integration, delayed disposal of IT assets and limited utilisation of systems.
10.;"     Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.101.30Bn, UGX.99.0Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1.4Bn representing an absorption level of 98.6%. As a result, I noted that out of the sixteen (16) planned outputs worth UGX.98.87Bn assessed; five (5) outputs were fully implemented, while eleven (11) outputs were partially implemented. I assessed the delivery of services from implemented activities and noted that the average time taken to issue passports increased to 22 days from 15 days in the prior year, 2020/2021. In addition, the processing and issuance of passports is more congested in the central region of Kampala compared to regional passport offices. There is a need to devise strategies to decongest Kampala Offices. I analysed data for 20,924 unissued passports and noted that 760 passports were still held at quality control, 2,435 passports had not been picked up for over six (6) months while 1,200 passports carried a status that showed that they were not ready for pickup, such as “for approval”, “for order generation” or for deferred capture. Such delays should be investigated and addressed to avoid discouraging applicants from picking up their passports. Only 32% of applicants who pay for express processing get their passports within two (2) days. Most applicants who pay for express services get their passports within 15 or more days. I assessed the extent of utilisation of smart gates at Entebbe International airport and observed only 0.05% of travellers in the financial year 2021/2022 were cleared using the smart gates. The underutilisation implies that the gates are not delivering the intended services to the citizens. I reviewed public land management and noted that NCIC’s annual land acquisition budgets were inconsistent with its strategic plans. The land acquisition processes did not comply with the PPDA laws, and some of the entity’s land was untitled. In addition, NCIC did not maintain a land register or capture the owned land in the asset’s The Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control.  Unqualified Opinion";;;
