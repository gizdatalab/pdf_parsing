I advised the Accounting Officers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and procedures to ensure data availability and integrity preservation in the event that some IT assets are decommissioned. In addition, the Board of Survey recommendations should be adhered to. 1.1 Disposal and Decommissioning of ICT Assets 15.11.1 of the TIs, 2017, PPDA Act, 2003 (as amended) and PPDA Regulations, 2014 together with the PFMA 2015, require MDAs and LGs to efficiently and transparently dispose assets as recommended. I noted that most MDAs are not disposing off IT assets as per the recommendations of the respective Boards of Survey. disposal of IT assets leads to a further diminution in value and loss to the government. In addition, a lack of appropriate policies may lead to the loss and misuse of critical data. Besides, hazardous materials from ICT equipment may be harmful to the environment.
