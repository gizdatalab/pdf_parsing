"         The Ministry had an approved budget of UGX.70,982,930,947, out of which UGX.64,457,203,544 was warranted resulting in a budget shortfall of UGX 6.5Bn. This shortfall negatively affected implementation of activities. Out of UGX 64.45 received, UGX.62.45 was absorbed resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2Bn. The failure to absorb all warrants as availed affected service delivery. I assessed the extent of implementation of a sample of 14 outputs worth UGX.52 Bn and observed that 2 outputs worth 34Bn were fully implemented, 7 outputs worth 18.4 Bn were partially implemented and 5 out-puts were not implemented at all. I noted that funds totaling to UGX.32, 812,431 were mischarged/diverted to pay for activities for which it was not budgeted. The entity had domestic arrears totaling to UGX.37Bn most of which related to unpaid contributions to International organizations. I noted that the Medical Insurance provided to staff of the Missions abroad was inadequate and did not cover some of the illnesses suffered by the Mission staff abroad. I further observed that the current abridged PPDA guidelines for missions abroad were not applicable in most host countries which resulted in non-compliance with the same. There was no mechanism to follow up and track promises and offers made by other governments to the Government of Uganda which resulted in loss of opportunities for Ugandans. I also noted that missions were significantly underfunded in regard to capital budgets which affected their ability to undertake any activity of a capital nature. I noted shortcomings in the management of the entities IT systems which included; failure to obtain NITA-U approvals for IT systems, lack of a steering Committee for ICT activities, lack of source codes for the Ministry’s IT systems and limited integration of the various IT systems. 73.
