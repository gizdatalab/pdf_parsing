"        Out of the total warrants of UGX.245.88Bn received during the financial year, the project submitted invoices totalling UGX.237.83Bn resulting in un-utilised warrants of UGX.8.05Bn representing an absorption level of 96.72%. I assessed the implementation of a sample of three (3) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of eighteen (18) activities worth UGX.237.8Bn and noted that; One (1) output with seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.13.799Bn were fully implemented. Two (2) outputs with eleven (11) activities worth UGX.224Bn were partially implemented. Out of the eleven (11) activities, the entity fully implemented seven (7) activities; two (2) activities were partially implemented, while three (3) activities remained unimplemented. I noted that the project continued to cumulatively withdraw and disburse funds to the different subgroups in the implementing districts. This currently stands at UGX.536.62Bn. However, only UGX.363.19Bn (67.6%) has been utilised and accounted for. The balance of UGX.173.43Bn (32%) remained unutilised and on the bank accounts for the different subgroups. I reviewed the project's performance against the results framework and observed that the project had achieved year four performance targets for nineteen (19) of the twenty-six (26) performance indicators representing 95%. However, seven (7) performance indicators in the project year three targets were not achieved. I noted that the implementing partners lacked tangible achievement in implementing their target activities in component 2 across all the districts due to the late engagement process of the implementing partners by DRDIP management and the six months suspension by the IGG. Additionally, the funds to the implementing partners only covered the labour training arrangements but did not consider the operational costs like fuel/ transport logistics. The project had an indicative planning figure of UGX.6.4Bn for implementing traditional and non-traditional livelihoods but did not disburse funds to appraised micro-projects for the year under review. I also noted that the project had not embarked on the procurement/ engagement process of the Capacity-Building Partners (CBPs) I noted that the project had outstanding commitments to the tune of UGX. 62,171,493 at the year-end. I noted that the DRDIP MIS was not yet integrated with other IT systems as required by the Project Implementation Manual. The un-integrated systems include; the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), OPM Geographical MIS used for monitoring and evaluation of government interventions across the country and the beneficiary registry in the Ministry of Gender. 1.
