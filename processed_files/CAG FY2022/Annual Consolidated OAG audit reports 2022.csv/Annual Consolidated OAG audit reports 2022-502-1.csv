The project absorbed 99.99% of the total available funds for spending. Out of the eleven (11) planned activities, ten (10) representing 90.9% were fully implemented; one (1) activity representing 9% was partially implemented. I assessed five key deliverables (construction of a surveillance station, 3 landing sites, and supply of a research vessel) and noted that they were not undertaken in a timely manner. This was as a result of rising water levels and delays in GoU counterpart funding that affected works.     30.
