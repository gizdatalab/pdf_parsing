    I noted that whereas the board had leased property to a private firm for a period of 30 years, over the years the firm had used the properties to secure loan facilities from different funders and created mortgages over the same without authorisation from the Board. UNRA is in the process of tarmacking the Masindi-Kinyara-Biiso Road which would affect some of the land currently subleased to the concessionaire however no disclosure was made in the financial statements in regard to the over 3 acres of land to be taken over by UNRA upon compensation. Physical inspections conducted revealed that there was gross mismanagement of the assets and abandonment of most of the buildings. Many assets were obsolete and were observed not to be maintained as agreed upon. I further noted that most buildings lacked a roof and were uninhabitable. I noted that there was no evidence of any board meetings. I also noted that the company last filed a board resolution in 2005 and that the company file at Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) lacked any resolution of the AGM appointing the directors and no evidence that AGM had ever been held.;;;

"      UMRA had an approved budget of UGX.7Bn out of which UGX.6.75Bn was warranted leading to a shortfall of UGX.0.25Bn (0.04% of the budget). As a result, some planned activities could not be implemented. There is an apparent conflict between Section 28 of the Tier-4-Microfinance-Institutions-Money-Lenders Act, 2016 and Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 with regard to the period for submission of financial Statements to the Auditor General. The former prescribes three months while the later provides 2 months after the end of the financial year. I noted the following matters in the management of the licensing mandate of the Authority over SACCOs and Money lenders; Challenges in licensing of SACCOs arising out of a conflict of laws between the Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions and Money lenders Act and the Cooperative Societies Act 2020 resulting in low registrations. Failure by the Minister to put in place the maximum interest chargeable by the different money lenders contrary to the requirements of the Act. Absence of clear guidelines for the determination of ‘fit and proper persons’ for purposes of money lenders. 28. Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA) Unqualified Opinion";;;
