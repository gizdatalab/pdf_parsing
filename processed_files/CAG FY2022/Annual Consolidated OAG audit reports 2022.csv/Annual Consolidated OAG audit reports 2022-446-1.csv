;;;;o I observed unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor which resulted into a total overpayment
;;;;of UGX.94,887,347.
;;;;o I established that for Mpigi town roads project, the contractor was paid partly in foreign currency despite a PSST
;;;;directive against the practice for solely Government of Uganda funded projects. USD 11,153,986.05 was paid
;;;;out to the Contractor at an exchange rate of 1USD at UGX.2,282.1, which meant that Government incurred an
;;;;extra cost of over UGX.15,448,939,920.88 to acquire this amount of dollars considering the average USD
;;;;exchange rate was UGX.3667.16 during the contract execution period.
;;;;o I established that for Mpigi town roads project, a total amount of UGX.2,319,823,581.79 was advanced to the
;;;;contractor in payment certificates (01 to 07) in regards to materials on site without any contractual basis.
;;;; Out of the approved budget of UGX.1,567.84Bn for land acquisition, UGX.1,292.13Bn was warranted / availed to
;;;;the entity during the period under review representing 82.4% performance.
;;;; I noted that out of the 2,080 land titles that the entity obtained during the financial years 2018/19 to 2021/22,
;;;;only 102 land titles had been transferred into UNRA’s name resulting into the balance of 1,978 (95%) land titles
;;;;to still have been in the names of PAPs by the end of the year under review.
;;;; During the review of implementation of ICT activities, I noted that the entity did not have a business continuity
;;;;and disaster recovery plan.
;;;; There was delayed completion of 22 road with a total contract value of UGX.82,177,512,239.
;;;; There were abandoned Road Works for mechanised maintenance on Busolwe – Nabumali Junction that had been
;;;;contracted at UGX.1,486,162,399.
5.;Contrary to the requirements of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that out of the release of UGX 119,673,517,241. for the project activities during the year only UGX 114,253,192, 241. was used on the Upgrading of Rwenkunye –Apac – Lira - Acholibur project activities and the balance totalling UGX 5,420,325,000. was relocated to other projects without the Ministers approval. In spite extension of the project closure date now planned as 12 October 2024 from 30th April 2020 as per the approved extension, a review of the monthly June 2021 Progress report, established that the cumulative physical progress as at 30th June 2021 was only 1.5% against 11.5% planned, resulting in an overall slippage of 13%. The contractors delayed to mobilize heavy machinery and equipment for works, slow progress by management to secure a right of way due to slow compensation to people affected by the road project (PAPs) and COVID-19 pandemic whereby the Contractors could not carry out the activities as planned due to restricted movements both local and international. I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired for the entire road having a total length of 191 Km for which compensation had been made is still in process. However, it was not clear how far the process had reached and when it would end, in spite of UNRA Management engaging Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban development (MoLHUD) on this matter.    Upgrading of Rwenkunye –Apac – Lira - Acholibur Road Project (252.5 Kms) implemented by Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) for the financial year ended 30 th June, 2021 Unqualified Opinion;;;
