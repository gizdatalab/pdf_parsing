   The Corporation has been holding 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 6.932 hectares without land titles for a long time without justification, exposing the corporation to the risk of loss of land thru land grabbing and encroachment. Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices. Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties.;;;

      The entity did not budget for NTR during the year under review as reflected in the statements of appropriation, although UGX.0.435Bn was collected. Failure to budget for NTR implies that there was no target upon which the Authority’s performance could be evaluated. Out of the total warrants received of UGX.28.3Bn during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling UGX.25.36Bn resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2.94Bn representing an absorption level of 90%, consequently some activities were either partially or not implemented at all, which negatively impacts service delivery. The Authority did not maintain a detailed risk register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets, as a result, there were no strategies and officers responsible for mitigating such risks or minimizing the impact in the event these risks materialized. Most pieces of land measuring approximately 11,931.343 hectares held by the entity were recorded in the entity land/assets register. However, 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 14.407 hectares were not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. The entity has outstanding payables of UGX.3.596Bn in the statement of financial position, a decrease by UGX.1.1140Bn from UGX.4.736Bn reported in the previous financial year. Although there was a decrease in domestic arrears, the entity accumulated new domestic arrears of UGX.966.425Mn. Continued accumulation of domestic arrears is contrary to the commitment control system of government, and also exposes government to risks of costly litigation. The authority had receivables of UGX.21.396Bn in the statement of financial position relating to rent, the sale of goods and services and administrative fees at the end of the financial year, a reduction by UGX.50.589Mn (0.24%) 12.
