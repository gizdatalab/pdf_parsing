"        Out of the approved budget of UGX.11.6Bn, UGX.11.4Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX 0.2Bn (1.7%). I sampled one out-put that was quantified with a total of two (2) activities worth UGX 0.17Bn and noted that this output was not implemented at all. Funds to the tune of UGX.0.031Bn were mischarged from the activities on which they were budgeted to other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The entity had outstanding domestic arrears to a tune of 283Mn, of which, UGX.186Mn were incurred during the year under review. Out of the 55 pieces of land measuring approximately 20.887 hectares owned by the Authority, 35 pieces of DDA land did not have land titles while 20 titled pieces of land had not yet been transferred in the names of Uganda Land Commission. I further noted that 1 piece of land was not recorded in the entity’s land register and the IFMS fixed assets module, while records for 2 pieces of land were scanty. 30 pieces of land were also not utilized by the entity at the time of Audit. Out of the approved one hundred and thirty-nine (139) posts only eighty-six (86) are filled and fifty-three (53) were vacant representing 38% understaffing. Review of management of IT investments revealed several shortcomings for instance; 5 IT Systems worth UGX.226Mn had no clearance from NITA-U and MoFPED, IT assets and systems procured at a cost of UGX.218.9Mn were not planned for, one IT system was not being utilised among others. I noted that DDA was not levying and collecting Cess on Milk or Milk products and neither did the Authority receive due compensation from the Ministry of Finance. Unqualified";;;
