      The entity had 27 pieces of land measuring approximately 75 hectares at the reporting date. However, management did not avail documentation to confirm the size, date and cost of acquisition, ownership and the location of the land. Similarly, the Hospital did not have Land titles for 22 pieces of land whose size the hospital could not ascertain. Six (6) pieces of land whose hectares and value could not be established due to management’s inability to avail the information had encumbrances in the form of caveats, court injunctions and encroachment. Similarly, some entities on the land had obtained title deeds without the consent/approval of the Hospital. For a sample of 463 key medical equipment in the Hospital, I noted that 46 were non-functional, 4 semi-functional and 413 are functional. In 2019, the Ministry of Health installed RX Solution, an electronic pharmaceutical management system in the stores with the objective of automatically submitting data to the MoH PIP system for stock status reporting. However, although the RX solutions had been installed on the Hospital computers in the store it was not being used by the stores staff. Hospital has six (6) systems which were not integrated and not automatically sharing information with other systems. As such, information sharing was purely manual despite being explicitly provided for in the respective system requirements. Direct procurements worth UGX.571,826,881 were undertaken by the Hospital without justification while a total of UGX.777,307,880 procurements were irregularly undertaken during the year.;;;
