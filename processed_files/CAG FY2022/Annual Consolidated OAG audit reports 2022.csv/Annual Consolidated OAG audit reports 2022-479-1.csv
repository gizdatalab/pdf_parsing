;;; I noted that 1 piece of land measuring 0.612 hectares (7.5 %) valued at UGX 0.465Bn out of the 8.06798 hectares
;;;of land owned by the entity had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions.
;;; It was observed that Uganda Post was paid UGX.2.81Bn as compensation for the land and building. However, I
;;;did not obtain the details of the application of these monies after the asset was sold off.

;;; There was no revaluation carried out over the past eight years. Non-asset revaluation implies the carrying amounts

      Out of the total funds available of 200.537Bn, only UGX. 147.082Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 53.455Bn representing an absorption level of 73.33%. Un utilised funds imply that some planned activities may not have been implemented, leading to delayed service delivery. The Commission irregularly paid UGX.228Mn for extra civil works on the installation of Lifts at Communications House. The additional works were not part of the original contract and were not approved by the Commission’s Contract Committee, contrary to the procurement regulations. The Commission did not charge 2% Gross Annual Revenue for Registered Television Stations and FM Radio stations as required by the UCC New License framework on fees and fines under General Notice No. 977 of 2017. This deprives the Commission of revenue. The Commission does not have procedures on management of confiscated equipment. This may lead to misuse of the confiscated equipment and may deepen disputes and cause financial losses to Government. The Commission has delayed completion of the National E-commerce Platform aimed at supporting SMEs in the informal sectors of the Agriculture, Retail and Services industry in Uganda, in order to promote access to online sales, overcome challenges in delivering to too hard-to-reach communities and to spur economic growth. As a result, the informal sector is losing out on the benefits of E-commerce. Eight (8) IT systems/equipment procured at UGX.9.8Bn were not cleared by NITA-U contrary to current guidelines. Besides, six (6) IT systems developed in-house were not being optimally utilized by the entity, while three (3) systems were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with other systems. Such weaknesses reduce the expected efficiencies ICT is supposed to bring in the business processes of the Commission. 55. Uganda Communications Commission. Unqualified Opinion;;;
