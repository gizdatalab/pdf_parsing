Unqualified Opinion;;;and thirty-one were disputing compensation amounts paid to them. The cases, reported between September 2018
;;;and August 2021, had not been resolved by the time of our audit, 2 years later. I noted that while the contractor was making payments towards obligations in regard to Pay as you earn tax (PAYE) and NSSF, they did not make returns to the relevant statutory bodies as required by law. In some instances 
;;;the payments were lower than the required amounts. Unpaid taxes deprive government of revenue, while staff
;;;deprived of their NSSF savings may resort to legal action.
;;; While UNRA obtained a certificate of no objection for the construction and construction supervision of Hoima Town
;;;roads, certificate of no-objection was not obtained for the construction and construction supervision of Masindi
;;;and Kigumba Town roads due to delays in approvals by the funders. By the time of audit in September 2022, the
;;;contractor was on site and the reported levels of completion for Masindi and Kigumba town roads was 77% roads
;;;21% respectively. The contractor had issued a notice of intention to close the site over non-payment for works
;;;due to delays in approvals.
;;; I noted that the consultant was yet to complete the designs for the OSBP due to non-harmonization of the designs
;;;with those of Rwanda and the DRC at time of audit and there was no proof of communication between the MOFA
;;;and authorities in Rwanda and the DRC to that effect.The OSBP consultant’s scope of activities was supposed to
;;;be covered in nine months (ending January 2022 with contract deliverable including an Inception Report, Monthly
;;;Progress Reports, Draft Feasibility Report, Final Feasibility Report, Draft Engineering Architectural Design Report
;;;and The Final Engineering Architectural Design. However by the time of our audit in September 2022, only the
;;;draft feasibility study had been delivered, pending URA comments and UNRA approval. The contract delivery date
;;;has been extended to 24th March 2023.
Contrary to the requirements of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that, although there were surplus funds amounting to UGX.9,526,145,971 for the Muyembe - Nakapiripirit Road project, management reallocated the funds to another Project to pay its debts without the Ministers approval. I noted delays in project implementation with cumulative physical progress as at 30th June 2021 at only 2.71% against 15.59% planned, resulting in an overall slippage of 12.88%. Contrary to the requirements of Clause 2.1 of the Contract Agreement between UNRA and the Contractor I noted that there were still some sections of the road that had pending land acquisition issues that needed to be addressed. I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired land (Muyembe-Nakapiripirit road having a total length of 92 Km) for which compensation had been made is still in process. However, it was not clear how far the process had reached and when it would end.     10.
