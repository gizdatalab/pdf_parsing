SN Observation Recommendation;;;;;;;;
The Accounting Officers attributed the above to:  Non-automation of the incremental dates in the IPPS by MoPS for which the Accounting Officers had no control.  Inadequate staff capacity Departments anniversaries/assumption overwhelming numbers. to in monitor the Human Resource appointment considering the staff of duty  Failure by staff who qualify for salary increments to notify the Human Resource Department.  The slow rollout of Human Capital Management System (HCMS) in all MDALGs. My interaction with MoPS revealed that there is still a challenge in moving staff from one step to another because this comes with extra budget costs which are not provided by MoFPED.;;;;;;;;
Payment of deductions (LST, PAYE, UNATU, UCLA) B-a (17) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 requires the Accounting Officer to deduct any monies due to Government from an Officer’s salary by way of statutory taxes like and any other authorized deductions. Furthermore, section B-a (18) requires that a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations may be deducted from his or her salary in accordance with the regulations. In addition, section 10.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralized salary processing 2014 required MALGS to pay deductions to the respective beneficiaries and that no arrears in respect to payroll deductions would be accepted. I compared the deductions in the IPPS payroll registers with the remittances/payments in the IFMS details XML payment file and noted an over and under to UGX.5,013,885,697, and UGX.7,697,912,554 respectively as shown in the table below and appendix 1 f. remittance amounting IPPS payroll Deduction amount (UGX) Amount remitted as per IFMS (UGX) Variance Over remittance (UGX) Under remittance (UGX) 1 URA 177,249,202, 488 173,280,707 359 2 LST 250 5,980,754,39 6 8,118,380,5 44 3 UBA/UCL 482 A 80,065,479,6 59 79,383,042, 549 4 Others Total 3,549,448,15 4 266,844,884, 697 3,410,599,9 64 264,192,730 416 - 1,501,880,7 13 - 2,583,748,0 85 - 902,686,46 4 - 25,570,435 - 5,013,885,6 97 5,470,375, 842 451,598,8 59 1,611,519, 228 164,418,6 25 7,697,912, 554 De duc tion cod e 249 Beneficia ry S N 3.1.3 Section;;;;;;;;
