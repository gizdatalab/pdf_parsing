6. Uganda Civil Aviation Authority. Unqualified Opinion;;; The Authority budgeted to receive UGX.3Bn from GOU, out of which UGX.1.13Bn was received, resulting in a shortfall of UGX1.87Bn. This affected maintenance activities in the upcountry aerodromes
;;;
;;; For a sample of twelve (12) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of forty seven (47) activities, one
;;;(1) output with three (1) activities and expenditure worth UGX.41.8m was fully implemented, three (3) outputs
;;;with seventeen (17) activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.65bn were partially implemented and eight (8) outputs
;;;with twenty nine (29) planned activities with no expenditure were not implemented at all.
;;; 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 23.913 hectares in Entebbe had encumbrances of approximately 8.92
;;;hectares in the form of encroachment by the local population.
;;; Out of 36 pieces of land measuring approximately 1662.94 hectares the Authority held, 18 pieces of land measuring
;;;approximately 496.184 hectares (30%) did not have land titles.
;;; Government entities owed UCAA a total of UGX.137.2Bn representing 77% of the total debtors of the Authority of
;;;UGX.177.72Bn. Most of these debts have been outstanding for more than 5 years

;;; I inspected the functionality of Kisoro aerodrome and observed that the runway tarmac had started stripping off
;;;and developing potholes which may be potentially dangerous.
;;; I carried out financial analysis of financial information and noted that the Authority has continuously made losses
;;;for the previous two years. However, the ratios computed indicate that UCAA is making significant improvements
;;;in profitability and its ability to sustain provision of services.
;;; Although management implemented the Point of Sale system in 2013 to track revenue reported, I noted that only
;;;16 out of the 25 concessionaire shops have POS terminals installed while some concessionaires use the POS
;;;terminals selectively. The Authority has failed to implement a Cargo Handling IT System to track revenues from
;;;Cargo.
;;; A review of ICT activities implemented revealed that a total of six (6) IT systems procured of UGX.5.54Bn were
;;;not cleared by NITA-U and a total of eight (8) systems were not integrated to share information with other systems.
;;;This can result in inefficiencies.
   Out of the total expected revenue collection during the financial year of UGX.348.384Bn, only UGX.141.750Bn was realized by the entity representing only 40.7% performance. This under collection affects service delivery UGX.22.825Bn collected in respect of airport tax from passengers through Entebbe International Airport had remained un-remitted to UCAA for over two years.
