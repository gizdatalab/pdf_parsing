"        The Ministry was supposed to receive UGX.836.61Bn, out of which UGX.767.1Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.69.51Bn. As a result some key activities like PAPs are not paid, Railway infrastructure rehabilitation not undertaken and EACAA School is not rehabilitated. MOWT was responsible for making payments under the contract for civil works for the Rehabilitation of the Tororo- Gulu Railway. However, the contractor terminated the contract due to failure by the Government of Uganda to meet its obligations but an advance payment of EUR.8,854,839.68 remained un recovered from the contractor. I assessed the implementation of a sample of twenty (22) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of one hundred and ten (110) activities worth UGX.693Bn and noted that; five (5) outputs with eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX.294.6Bn were fully implemented, fifteen (15) outputs with ninety seven (97) activities worth UGX.390.4Bn were partially implemented and two (2) outputs with five (5) activities worth UGX.8.1Bn were not implemented at all. UGX.3,577,035,246 was irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. An inspection of the regional mechanical workshops established that 23 District road equipment remained in the Workshops’ yards for a period of between one to five years without repair. They are thus not serving their purpose An inspection of the East African civil Aviation Academy (Soroti Flying School) indicated that all its nine (9) training aircrafts were grounded due to the expiry of their insurance and/or being faulty. I further noted that three aircrafts involved in accidents during the year under review had not been repaired due to the delayed compensation by the insurance service provider. Land acquired under the SGR project, measuring approximately 1,305.886 acres costing UGX.99,343,193,128 was not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. I observed that a total of two (2) IT systems/equipment with a total cost of UGX.200,780,000 were implemented without business cases and approval by NITA-U.";;;
2. Uganda Road Fund. Unqualified Opinion;;; Due to Government reforms to rationalize Government agencies and public expenditure, there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt that the Council shall remain a Going Concern in the foreseeable future.

;;;periodic maintenance of roads respectively.
