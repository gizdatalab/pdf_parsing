    Out of the approved budget of UGX. 2.4Bn, UGX. 2.1Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX 0.3Bn (11.6%). I sampled out twelve out-puts and noted that eleven (11) outputs worth UGX.1.5Bn were fully implemented while one (1) output worth 0.6Bn was partially implemented. The entity received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.0.513Bn which was never declared to the PSST. Out of the approved staff structure of 37 staff, only 19 positions were filled leaving a balance of 18 (49%) vacant. 5.

Unqualified 6. Resilience Project (RPLRP) Opinion;;;; Out of the budgeted UGX.23.9Bn for donor project activities, only UGX.14Bn was available, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.9.8Bn representing 41% of the budget. Further, only UGX.0.65Bn was warranted out of the UGX.1.0Bn GOU co-funding resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.35Bn representing 35% of the approved budget.

;;;;" Out of the total available funds of UGX.14.03Bn; UGX.13.22Bn was spent by the Project resulting in an unspent"
;;;;balance of UGX0.81Bn representing an absorption level of 94.2%.
;;;;" Of the 4 quantified activities worth UGX.12.4Bn assessed; 2 activities representing 50% were fully implemented"
;;;;while 2 activities representing 50% were partially implemented.
;;;; I noted inadequacies in service delivery in form of delayed works and incomplete livestock marketing and
;;;;production infrastructure i.e. handover for construction of four (4) sites was delayed between 8 to 16 months and
;;;;two (2) sites were yet to be completed despite project closure, hence requiring GOU funding interventions.
;;;; Out of the total expected loan amount of USD 40Mn only USD. 36.297Mn was received during the project life cycle
;;;;resulting in un-disbursed loan proceeds of USD 3.703Mn (UGX.13.9Bn) representing 9.3% of the loan amount and
;;;;as a result Government of Uganda will have to pay back the loan in full including funds that were never disbursed
;;;;for Project activities which reflects a loss to Government.
"    The approved project budget for donor funds was UGX.24.23Bn however UGX.25.13Bn was availed for spending, resulting in an excess of UGX 0.908Bn (3.7%). On the other hand, the approved GOU budget was 0.5Bn out of which UGX.0.398Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.102Bn which was 20% of the approved budget. Out of the total funds available from both donors and Gou of UGX 25.52Bn, UGX 8.897 was absorbed resulting in unspent balances of UGX 16.62Bn. This represents absorption of only 35% of the funds available. I observed that out of the 34 activities worth UGX.5.327Bn assessed; 14 activities- 41% were fully implemented, 15 activities-44% were partially implemented, while 5 activities-15% were not implemented. I noted shortcomings that affect service delivery for the citizens such as; failure to maintain demonstration gardens, delayed approval of District Nutrition Action plans, delayed release of funds to Districts, and unutilised funds at the Districts. 7.
