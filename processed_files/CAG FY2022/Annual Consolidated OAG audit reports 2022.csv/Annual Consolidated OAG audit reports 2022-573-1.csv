"     Out of the approved budget of UGX.15.939Bn, UGX.15.536Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.403Bn (representing 2.53% of the approved budget). The activities that were affected by the budget cuts included travel abroad (UGX.0.156Bn), validation of pensioners (UGX.0.012Bn) and workshops (UGX.0.235Bn). Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.15.536 Bn, only UGX.15.323Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unutilized warrant of UGX.0.213Bn (representing an absorption level of 98.6%). As a result, I noted that of the thirty-one (31) quantified activities worth UGX.14.51Bn assessed; twenty-nine (29) activities (representing 87%) were fully implemented and two (2) activities (representing 13%) were partially implemented. The Institute did not have land titles for the four (4) pieces of Land under its use. I further established that apart from Kamwanyi land measuring about 1.416 hectares and the UVRI Headquarters land measuring about 29.137 hectares, management was not certain of the size of the land in Arua and at Zika Forest. Lack of Land titles could result into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land. The reported payables of UGX.202,811,084 relating to property tax that the Institute owes Entebbe Municipal Council have been outstanding since FY 2010/11. Under the circumstances, the entity runs a risk of litigation that could result in a financial loss in the form of penalties. Contrary to PPDA Regulations, contract managers did not submit monthly reports to the Accounting Officer on the progress of contracts worth GBP.7,938.63; USD.33,473.07 and UGX.3,280,937,286. Failure to monitor the progress of contracts increases the risk of poor contract performance as gaps are not identified early for remedial action. 38. Virus Research Unqualified Uganda Institute.

39. National Medical Stores. Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the NTR estimate of UGX.56.38Bn, NMS realized only UGX.45.086Bn representing a performance of 80% of the target and a shortfall of UGX.11.265Bn.

;;; According to the GOU approved budget, NMS was supposed to receive UGX 600.314Bn out of which UGX.589.056Bn was
;;;warrantied resulting in a shortfall of GoU funding of UGX.11.258Bn. Essential drugs could thus not be procured.
;;; The value of Non-Viable Stock rose from UGX.5,161,429,000 (FY 2020/21) to UGX.13,418,720,000 composed of expired and
;;;unused drugs, gloves and other items resulting into increases the costs involved in destruction and denial of essential drugs
;;;to the population.
;;; Management reported a provision for doubtful debts to the tune of UGX.25,891,381,000 composed of debts that appear
;;;irrecoverable but efforts to have MoFPED approve the write-off have not been successful.
;;; Management presented the status of twelve (12) court cases for and against NMS as part of the contigent liabilities. However,
;;;three (3) of the court cases stretch to over 10 years (from 2008) without any ruling by the Courts of Law.
;;; The ERP system (NMS+) which is used to undertake the roles of warehousing, finance, procurement, audit and fleet
;;;management was not integrated nor automatically sharing information with other government systems such as IFMS, Human
;;;Capital Management and e-Government procurement. This leads to duplications and inefficiencies.
