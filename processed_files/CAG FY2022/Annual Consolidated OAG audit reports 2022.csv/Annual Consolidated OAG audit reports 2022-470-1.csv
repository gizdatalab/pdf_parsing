 According to the staff establishment, the approved number of positions for PPDA is 140, out of which only 103 positions were filled, leaving 37 positions vacant, which is 26% of the workforce. Failure to fill the staff establishment hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Authority.;;;
35. Uganda Property Holdings Limited (UPHL) Unqualified Opinion;;;The entity budgeted to collect UGX.11.16Bn revenue and collected UGX.10.88Bn resulting into an underperformance of UGX.0.28, which was 2.6% of the budget. The underperformance in NTR collections was partly attributed to the depreciating value of the Uganda shilling against the Kenyan shilling and the Great Britain Pound. 
;;;
;;; I noted that the entity had receivables from UGX.4.7Bn in the statement of financial position at year-end implying
;;;that these were not honoured within the 15 working days as required by regulations thereby holding up funds
;;;which would have been used to implement planned activities.
;;; A review of the properties owned by the Government of Uganda within and outside the country revealed that
;;;several commercial properties are not owned and managed by UPHL, yet the company was established majorly to
;;;hold, invest in and control the real estate properties of the Government of Uganda. The properties risk being
;;;condemned because of poor management.
;;; The company procured IT systems which were not integrated thereby not meeting the intended objective of shared
;;;information.
  I noted that Uganda Property Holdings Limited did not manage some Government Commercial properties. This company was established principally to own, invest in and control the real estate Properties of the Government of Uganda. As a result, some commercial buildings in Nairobi, Kinshasa, and London are not well maintained to the extent of being at risk of condemnation by the relevant city authorities, like the Commercial Building in Nairobi. Management explained that the cabinet is handling the issue, and I am waiting for the cabinet's decision. Uganda Property Holding has 39 properties comprising of 23 in Mombasa, 12 in Uganda, and 4 in the UK. I reviewed all ownership documents for the said properties and found that two properties did not have certificates of title, namely, Plot M82, Masese, Jinja, and Plot KRC Mbaraki, Mombasa. I advised management to follow up on the above properties and secure their ownership by obtaining the certificate of titles. 36. Uganda Property Holdings Limited (UPHL) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;

37. Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.67.52Bn, the Bureau utilized warrants amounting to UGX.60.12Bn resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.7.4Bn representing an absorption level of 89.2%. As a result, I noted that of the 124 quantified activities worth UGX.23.6Bn assessed, 90 activities representing 72.6% were fully implemented, 22 activities representing 21.8% were partially implemented, while 7 activities representing 5.6% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.
;;;
;;; A review of the staffing structure for UBOS revealed that out of the total approved staff establishment of 413
;;;staff, only 285 (69%) positions were filled, leaving 128 (31%) positions vacant. Understaffing negatively impacts
;;;on the Bureau’s capacity to deliver services.
