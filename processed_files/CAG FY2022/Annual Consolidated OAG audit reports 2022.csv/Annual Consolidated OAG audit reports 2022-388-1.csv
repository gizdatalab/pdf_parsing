"register in the Government’s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), and the manual land register maintained does not comply with the format prescribed by the Accountant General. I reviewed IT systems management and noted that NCIC’s systems are not fully integrated, and the entity’s ICT governance had a number of shortfalls. For instance, there were no structures to oversee ICT implementation; no approved IT staff structure, internal audit did not review ICT systems and the entity’s business continuity policy, and the plan was not comprehensive enough to ensure the seamless continuation of business operations in the event of a disaster. I noted that the execution of the Turnkey contract for supplying an e-passports system and booklets did not fully comply with the contract terms. For instance, the construction of the NCIC personalisation building and a security printing factory has not yet commenced, migration of legacy data has not been done.  ";;;
