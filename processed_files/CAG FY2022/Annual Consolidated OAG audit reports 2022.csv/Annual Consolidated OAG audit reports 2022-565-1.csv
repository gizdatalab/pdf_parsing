UGX.9,607,206 deducted on the payroll was not remitted to respective beneficiary institutions. Relevant documents to support the creation of assignments on the IPPS payroll for 4 pensioners were not on their respective files.

Out of UGX.1,200,000,000, was allocated for procurement of drugs and medical supplies UGX.1,021,000,000 (85%) resulting in a deficit of UGX. 179,000,000 (15%).

21. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sept 2021 Unqualified Opinion;;; Although the Project had budgeted for USD 4,820,288 (UGX. 14,423,091,800), only USD 2,610,101 (UGX. 9,479,082,377) was received for utilisation for the financial year ending 30th September 2021 (representing 54%). I further noted that out of the USD 2,610,101 (UGX. 9,479,082,377) received, the project only utilised USD 2,577,021 (UGX. 9,362,167,833) leaving a balance of USD 33,080 (UGX 116,914,544 ). The low release of funds coupled with under absorption of funds implies unrealistic over budgeting. In addition the low absorption of funds received constrains management in the delivery of planned project outputs.
