SN Observation Recommendation;;;;;;
to bring cases of un-validated staff to the attention of MoPS for follow up with NIRA. Going forward, with the introduction of HCM, data of only validated staff will be migrated.;;;;;;

In addition, my interaction with MoPS revealed that with the migration to HCM, the process of payroll payments will be seamless because the HCM will directly interface with the IFMS. 13.1 and 13.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralised salary payment processing, 2014 requires that the IPPS information tallies with the interface file of the vote. By, the final payroll should be mapped onto the interface to show the same data. I compared the detailed payroll register reports (MoPS) with the interface files from the Core FTP (MoFPED) and noted variances of UGX.28,347,479,053 in 107 LGs. Details are in Appendix 1 j. Category Salaries Pension Gratuity Total and Number employees/Pensioners of Amount 10,504 25 10,529 27,545,118,941 802,360,112 28,347,479,053 I further noted that some employees captured on the payroll and uploaded onto the Core FTP system did not appear in the interface files prompting the Accounting Officers to include them manually. This has created an opportunity for manipulation of salary funds thus leading to over/under payments. The Accounting Officers explained that the LGs had no control over the above, since Core FTP system is controlled by MoFPED. During my interaction with MoFPED, the Accountant General indicated that the Accounting Officers were permitted to make adjustments to rectify possible errors on the payroll without necessarily abusing the system. The Accountant General further explained that the window for making adjustments was deactivated after the audit. 3.1.7 Inconsistencies between interface files and payroll registers Section;;;;;;

3.1.8 Payments of salaries, pension & gratuity off the IPPS;;;;;;
4.5 of establishment notice no. 2 of 2019 requires the responsible officer to pay for only salaries, pension and gratuity processed through IPPS. A comparison of the IPPS payroll register and IFMS payment file revealed that UGX.13,502,944,430 was paid off the IPPS to 3,926 employees and 870 pensioners/beneficiaries as shown below and detailed in the table below and Appendix 1 j. Category Salaries Number staff/pensioners of Payment Off IPPS 3,926 4,898,961,116 Paragraph;;;;;;I advised the PS
