"    Out of the total receipts for the financial year UGX.8.088Bn, the Commission spent UGX.7.744Bn resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.0.343Bn (representing an absorption level of 95.75%). As a result, I noted that out of the 19 quantified activities worth UGX.7.309Bn assessed; 7 activities representing 37% were fully implemented while 12 activities representing 63% were partially implemented. On 31st March 2015, Butabika Hospital Management Board permitted the Commission together with four (4) other government entities to utilise three acres of Butabika Hospital land on a lease to construct office premises. However, by close of the year under review, no action had been taken by the Commission despite its current substantial annual rent expenses of UGX.680,000,000. I noted that although the Board of Survey recommended twenty-seven (27) IT equipment valued at UGX.63,300,000 for decommissioning in the financial year 2021/22, no disposals had been made. Out of 79 positions only 52 are filled leaving 27 positions vacant. 44. Health Service Commission. 2021/22 Unqualified Opinion";;;

;;;  warranted resulting into a revenue shortfall of UGX. 0.185Bn. The Commission received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX. 939,268,646 which was not declared to Treasury and therefore not appropriated by Parliament Although UAC did not budget to collect NTR during the year under review UGX.40,180,000 was collected as NTR.
;;; I reviewed the implementation of nine (9) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of forty-four (44) activities worth
;;;UGX.14.55Bn and noted that the reported performance at activity level was not aligned with the planned performance. As a
;;;result, it was difficult to assess the level of implementation of the planned out puts.
;;; UGX.13,347,458 was irregularly diverted from workshops and seminars code and spent on staff lunch without seeking and
;;;obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; The entity had reported payables of UGX.76,162,182 which have been accumulating since July 2005.
"  Out of the UGX.243.62Bn total funds available for spending, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48Bn representing 87% under absorption. The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery. I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations  The Corporation has been holding 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 6.932 hectares without land titles for a long time without justification, exposing the corporation to the risk of loss of land thru land grabbing and encroachment.
