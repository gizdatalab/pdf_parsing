"   Contrary to the requirements of the Regulation 16 of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that UGX.4,526,512,477 (50%) of the available GoU counterpart funds for FY 2021/22 was reallocated to fund expenditures for Civil works of Kapchorwa-Suam road Project. This action overrides established budgeting procedures without the Minister’s approval. I reviewed the financing charges on the ADF loan and noted that total charges of UGX.3,357,809,609 were accrued on the disbursed and undisbursed loan balances with ADF during FY 2021/22. Furthermore, due to delayed procurement, prolonged acquisition of the Project right-of-way, and slow execution of works by the Contractors, the initial disbursement deadline of 31st December 2020 was extended to 31st December 2024. The implication is that the project is exposed to higher avoidable interest charges accruing from undisbursed loan balance due to loan under-utilization and hence delayed implementation of Project activities. The upgrade of the Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu 78.5 km stretch attained 25.75% physical progress during the FY 2021/22. Cumulatively, since the Project’s inception, 68.35% physical progress had been attained, against the planned progress of 84.30% as of 30th June 2022. The slippage of 15.95% recorded was attributed to encumbrances on land on sections that required extra land take beyond the 30m standard Right of Way, excessive rainfall in the region, and the Contractors restricted access to Ishasha Bridge.Time elapsed as of 30th June 2022 was 43.8 months representing 88.3% of the total extended civil works contract duration of (49.6 months). Cumulative financial progress recorded was 55.23% against the planned 76.25%.  There was a delay in conducting consultancy services procurement processes from initiation to contract signature; The procurement to conduct gender awareness took 1,513 days (equivalent to 4 years and 2 months) 12. of Road Sector Support Project 5 (Upgrading Rukungiri-Kihihi- Ishasha/Kanungu Bumbobi- Lwakhakha Roads (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2022 and Unqualified Opinion";;;
