SN Observation Recommendation;;;;;;
Additionally, Paragraph (L-d) (3) provides that a public officer has an option to receive all his or her pension as an annuity or to commute a third (1/3) of his or her pension for a 15-year period and receive it as a lump sum at retirement. I recomputed the pension and gratuity benefits and noted that 37 LGs did not accurately compute pension and gratuity benefits for 423 pensioners. Details are in Appendix 1 h. Category Gratuity Pension Total Number of pensioners/benefi ciaries Overpayment Underpayment 222 201 423 276,463,546 442,670,972 53,663,042 61,942,500 330,126,588 504,613,472 The Accounting Officers attributed this to failure by IPPS to automatically update the notches at the individuals’ anniversary of appointment/assumption. Additionally, adjustment of scales and subscales at the point of capturing pension and gratuity by the Accounting Officers was not guided by MoPS. My interaction with MoPS revealed that there is a provision for the Accounting Officers to rectify retiree’s base pay on the IPPS towards the date of retirement for which they are either not aware or are reluctant to adjust.;;;;;;was also advised

Access and deletion from the payroll Delayed access of newly recruited or transferred staff 3.1.6 a);;;;;;

to the payroll B-a (11) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 states that the Accounting Officer shall ensure that the Public officer accesses the payroll within four (4) weeks from the date of assumption of duty. I noted that 4,341 newly recruited/ transferred employees delayed to access payroll with the worst delays ranging from 5 to 12 months. As a result, by close of the financial year, 1,746 staff had not been paid a total of UGX.2,802,520,509. Details are in Appendix 1 i. Failure to access payroll affects staff livelihood and leads to un- necessary accumulation of arrears. Accounting Officers attributed this to challenges with setting-up staff in the IPPS by MoPS because the process is not fully decentralised for which the LGs have no control. During my interaction with MoPS, the PS attributed the delay to recruitments outside the approved structure that necessitates verification and subsequent clearance. Section The;;;;;;I advised MoPS to
;;;;;;ensure that the
;;;;;;bottlenecks in
;;;;;;recruitment are

;;;;;;verification and
