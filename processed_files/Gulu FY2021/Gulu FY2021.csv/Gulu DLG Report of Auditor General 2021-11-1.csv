;The Accounting Officer explained that the affected pensioners had died and their families failed to avail names of administrators on time and some estates had over stayed for 15 years on the pension payroll after which their payment were stopped as per the Pension Act.;
1.5;Internal Control Weaknesses;
;i) Monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis and remittance of quarterly returns to MoPS I noted that the District did not prepare monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis and thus did not submit quarterly returns on payroll to MoPS, contrary to Paragraph 2.1 of Establishment Notice No. 1 of 2020. led to accumulations of arrears and under absorption of wage, pension and gratuity budget. Accounting Officer attributed this to the Human Resource Management sector was unable to undertake monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis returns on the payroll to MoPS because of the health condition of the head of the sector, whose absence created staffing gap in the sector. This The;I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analyses are undertaken and that quarterly returns on payroll are submitted to MoPS.
;"ii) Payments of salaries, pension & gratuity off IPPS Paragraph 4.5 of Establishment Notice No. 2 of 2019 requires the responsible officer to pay for only salaries, pension and gratuity processed through IPPS. From a comparison of the payroll register and IFMS payment file. noted that 16 staff and 05 pensioners were paid a total of UGX. 114 million off the IPPS, as shown in Appendix 7. control weakness creates an opportunity for payment of salaries and pension to non-eligible persons, hence loss of funds to Government. The Accounting Officer explained that:- 1. Mr. Opwonya Eric Mark Kafunzi is an employee who was being paid salary from Uganda Road Fund off the payroll. 2. The interim chairpersons of the newly created Sub Counties had not been loaded on the IPPS; hence being paid off the IPPS. I This";I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that salaries, pension and gratuity is processed and paid through the IPPS.
1.6;"System related challenges i) Inconsistencies between MoPS and entity payroll registers I observed that there were variances of UGX.35,994,412 between the figures in the MoPS IPPS and entity payroll register, as shown in appendix 8. The above undermines the integrity of the IPPS system and there is risk of manipulation and misappropriation of salary/pension funds due to lack of reconciliatory controls between the entity information and IPPS master data at MoPS. The Accounting Officer attributed the inconsistencies to cases where some salary arrears as effected/ invoiced directly through the IFMS outside the IPPS due to validation challenges; hence, inconsistencies in the information on IPPS and NIS.";I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the entity IPPS payroll registers are consistent with MoPS payroll data.
;"ii) Effectiveness and reliability of the IPPS/NID interface I the staff/pensioner/beneficiaries’ verification interface and noted the following; reviewed the effectiveness and reliability of IPPS/NID  There was adequate sensitization and training in the use and navigation of the system.";I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoPS to ensure effective verification of the IPPS
