FOREWORD BY THE AUDITOR GENERAL

In accordance with my audit mandate set out under Article 163 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and the National Audit Act, 2008, I hereby present to you the Annual Audit Report on the Consolidated Public Accounts of Uganda; Local Government; and Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations, and State Enterprises and Companies in which Government has a controlling interest.

In delivering my mandate, I audited financial statements for 128 MDAs, 107 Statutory Corporations 145 Local Governments and 2048 Lower Local Governments. In addition, I undertook four (4) thematic audits covering, Management of Covid-19 pandemic intervention, compensations of Project Affected Persons, implementation of the approved budget, and Payroll and Pension payments.

The Office reviewed its audit process to comply with the Covid-19 guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Public Service, by conducting some critical meetings virtually and coping with a lean staff. In addition, Stakeholders have increased their call to strengthen accountability in the wake of the Pandemic triggering special audits and investigations relating to Covid-19 expenditure.

Due to the impact of the Pandemic, some audits were not conducted as planned, but we are committed to continuously adding value to society by making recommendations that enhance accountability and improved service delivery through audit services.

I extend my gratitude to the Government of Uganda and all other stakeholders for the support rendered to my office during the audit year. I also thank my staff for their unwavering commitment during this challenging period.

2.1  
REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of the Republic of Uganda for the year ended 30 th June 2021. These financial statements comprise of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement together with other accompanying statements, notes, and accounting policies.

In my opinion, the Consolidated Financial statements of the Government of the Republic of Uganda for the financial year ended 30th June 2021 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 52 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statement’s section of my report. I am independent of the Treasury in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B), the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.

Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.

Implementation of the approved budget

outputs. Subsequently, the PS/ST issued a Budget Execution Circular that communicated the budget strategy, policy, and administrative issues to guide the budget implementation for the financial year 2020/2021.

During my overall risk assessment exercise, I noted that MDAs and LGs are still experiencing challenges in implementing the budgets approved by parliament and policy guidance’s issued by PS/ST, which has continued to affect the performance and credibility of the budget negatively. These challenges include; lack of strategic plans that are aligned to the National Development Plans, underperformance of revenue, implementation of off-budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non- implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.

I am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of several activities. Consequently, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic. It is against this background that the implementation of the budget was again considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning for the current audit year.

Consequently, I developed procedures to address the performance of the budget of the entity (Detailed reports are provided in individual entity reports).

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following;

SN Finding Recommendation a) Revenue performance  
I advised the Secretary to the A review of the approved budget estimates of the Government of Treasury to devise Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 revealed that the means of ensuring initial approved budget (resource envelope) for the financial year that all budgeted 2020/21 was UGX.45,493.69 Bn. The funding was later revised to revenue is always UGX.48,726.77 Bn, following approval for additional domestic collected to fund the financing of UGX.3,234 Bn. It was estimated that Tax and Non Tax budget as approved. revenue amounted to UGX.22,024.66 Bn, domestic borrowing would  
finance UGX.6,794 Bn while external financing would provide grants  
of UGX.1,719.91Bn and loans of UGX.10,702.10Bn.

Secretary to Treasury indicated that the funds releases to Votes are in line with the available resources issued in quarterly expenditure limits which are supported by actual revenue collections from URA and also indicated that Ministry of finance provides guidance by way of circulars to all Votes to fund only critical activities within the work plans in line with the available resources.

The occurrence has an implication of increasing financing costs incurred by the government since the interest costs and redemptions are done by Bank of Uganda which in turn charges the treasury for the advance. Most of the unspent funds under wage related to pension payments casting doubt on the existence of the said pensioners. absorption negatively affects service delivery since some of the planned projects and activities are not undertaken. Secretary to Treasury indicated that GoU operates a Cash budget which is based on actual inflows. The year under audit experienced cash shortfalls arising from, Domestic revenue shortfall as a result of the Covid -19 pandemic , late disbursements from IMF ,which came in on 30 June 2021 & Non disbursement from Afri-Exim Bank and African Development Fund.

It was established that during the financial year ended 30 th June 2021, supplementary funding totalling UGX.6.13Tn was granted by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. It was, however, noted that the source of the funding for the supplementary expenditure was not clearly shown before approval was granted.  As a result, the supplementary expenditure was instead financed by internal budget cuts from various votes thus affecting implementation of plans/ activities by the affected votes. I noted that, although the budget was increased to UGX.51.625Tn, it was only funded to the tune of UGX.46.6Tn (90%funding). approval of supplementary budgets without a corresponding increase in revenue/financing could be attributed to fiscal indiscipline which leads to increased funding gap affecting the earlier budget objectives and plans. Secretary to Treasury responded that for the Financial Year 2022/23, the Ministry of Finance was using zero based budgeting approach to prioritize critical activities and expenditures to avoid supplementary requests during execution.

Paragraph 29 of the Budget Execution Circular for the Financial year states that if an external agency provides funds in the course of implementation of the budget or any funds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation, these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line with the Public Finance Management Act 2015. noted that 30 entities received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.627.124Bn, which was never declared to the PS/ST and was also not appropriated by Parliament. As such, no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PS/ST. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities, contrary to Section 43(1) of the PFMA 2015 and the budget execution guidelines.

2.1.2. COVID 19 expenditure

The emergence of the Global Covid-19 pandemic presented a social and economic threat to many countries in the world, including Uganda. In response, the Government of Uganda developed and instituted several interventions to control and avert the effects of the pandemic on the economic and social wellbeing of its citizens. The interventions included instituting a total lockdown, closure of airports, restriction of cross boarder movements, and increased surveillance among others which in turn necessitated additional funding. Mobilisation of revenue was also negatively affected due to low economic activity.

In addition to the local revenue raised by the Government to support the budget, Government proceeded to secure additional funding to facilitate the efforts and interventions

being undertaken to manage and control COVID-19 and its effects on the economy and the society in general.

In a letter dated 09th August 2021, the PSST advised me that the total amount released for COVID expenditure in the FY 2020/21 was UGX.2,371Bn of which a total of UGX.677Bn was disbursed for the settlement of domestic arrears.

During the audit, I designed and performed procedures that I considered appropriate under the circumstances to enable me to gather evidence to address the specific objectives listed below;

i) Confirm whether the funds received by Treasury were dully appropriated by parliament.  
ii)

Establish whether funds appropriated and allocated were received by the different votes  
iii)

Establish whether the appropriated funds were utilised for the purpose for which they were approved.  
iv)

Assess the existence and effectiveness of internal control systems. v)

Assess the extent of achievement of planned output by the different entities  
vi) Establish whether all funds disbursed were properly accounted for and value for money was attained.  
vii)

Make appropriate recommendations to strengthen accountability and transparency.

From the procedures undertaken the following summarised key findings were noted, the detailed report was issued separately as the COVID 19 thematic report;

Summary of key findings

- USD 345million received by GoU in respect of support to Bank of Uganda for Balance of Payment was confirmed received and banked intact in Citi bank New York to enhance the Country’s foreign reserves.

- A total of UGX 676Bn was allocated and disbursed to various MDAs to settle domestic arrears with a view of improving liquidity within the local business community. I noted that 90% of funds used appropriately for the intended puropose; however, I noted diversion of funds to pay for unrelated expenditure worth UGX 4.897Bn (0.7%), unsupported domestic arrears of UGX 27.38Bn(4%), and Payment for contested/rejected domestic arrears of UGX.1.245Bn(0.2%). I also noted that UGX 33.8Bn (5%) was used to settle international obligations thus did not contribute to the stated objective since the funds were externalised.

- UGX 260Bn allocated for the Emyooga programme was disbursed to Microfinance Support Centre with a goal of transforming household incomes by increasing employment opportunities and access to financial services to the rural areas. Audit confirmed that UGX 219.40Bn (84%) had so far been disbursed to 6,326 EMYOOGA SACCOs. It was, however, noted that the SACCOs were in the process of obtaining operational licenses; no MoUs had been entered into between the disbursing entity and the beneficiary SACCOs; UGX.34,716,666,049 (1.3%), though disbursed, remained un- accessed by the beneficiary SACCO.

- A total of UGX.56.8Bn was disbursed to MSc to increase the funds available for on- lending to different businesses. I noted that MSc lacked capacity at zonal offices to appraise loans which was also manifested in the unbalanced approach for loan appraisals. A total of UGX 13b (23%) was disbursed to applicants without MSC finalising the perfection of securities for the collaterals. UGX.2.5Bn (4%) was irregularly advanced to applicants contrary to the credit policy. A total of UGX 3.149Bn (6%) was advanced to applicants with no collateral.

- A total of UGX.31.033Bn was disbursed to the Ministry of Science Technology and innovation to support 23 selected projects of scientists and innovators engaged in CoVID-I9 scientific research, including the procurement of specialized machinery and equipment, development of vaccines, drug diagnostics, and other operational costs. The funds were divided into UGX.15.787Bn for purchase of Equipment and UGX.15.245Bn for Operational Costs. An MOU was entered with Presidential Scientific Initiative on Epidemics (PRESIDE) to provide technical and administrative oversight at an operational level. It was noted that most projects were progressing well. It was also noted that due to the general weaknesses identified, there was a need to provide more guidance to the beneficiaries on how to account for Government funds.

- Out of UGX 558.68Bn appropriated, 531.8Bn was disbursed to Uganda Development Bank for recapitalization, leaving UGX 26.87Bn unremitted by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. From the amount disbursed, funds worth UGX 234bn had been paid out to various beneficiaries; by the time of the audit, the balance of UGX 292.66Bn was still deposited in commercial banks.
- Of the amounts paid out, UGX95bn was sent to financial institutions and SACCOs following MoUs entered into by UDB and the financial Institutions, for the latter to on lend to stated beneficiaries.

- Euros 1,602,370 (equivalent to UGX.7,136,910,000) received by UDBL from the European Union for the Tourism Sector. As at 10 th June 2021, 25 applications worth UGX 9.55 Bn had been approved, and grant disbursements worth UGX 4.34 Bn. had been processed to 14 projects.

- Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development disbursed UGX.126.9Bn to Uganda Development Corporation, to finance projects aimed at supporting the private sector to avert the effects of Covid-19. I noted that the capitalisation grants to UDC are assigned to specific projects thereby nullifying the internal appraisal processes of UDC. 54% of the funds remained unutilised as the projects were not ready for investment.

- UGX 253.59bn was released and received by the Ministry of Health. MoH used the money to procure medical supplies, 282 motor vehicles, pay allowances to medical workers, masks, intensive care equipment and build modular houses at 6 border points. All the planned activities were undertaken amidst many challenges. I noted a diversion of funds totalling UGX 7.98Bn. Though funds were paid for the acquisition of vaccines, there were delays in the delivery of the vaccines due to the global demand. There was a delay in the installation of intensive care equipment in Gulu, Mbarara, Bombo, and Lacor hospitals due to building inadequacies.

- Whereas medical workers requested to be given UGX.150,000 per day as risk allowance, this was not possible and they were instead paid UGX.80,000 per day. They made a

13

---

request to parliament to have this amount exempted from taxes, but the issue was never resolved. In the meantime, UGX.2.2Bn meant for PAYE was not deducted from the allowances paid to medical workers in the period under review.

Key Recommendations

- Management should ensure that compensating controls are put in place in times where conventional controls cannot be implemented.
- Sensitisation of private individuals and organisations to whom public resources are entrusted should be done prior to disbursement of the funds.
- The PS/ST should clearly communicate the intentions of given initiatives before funds are disbursed to implementing agencies to avoid a mismatch between the intended objectives and actual outputs.
- Government entities and projects should be assessed for capacity to implement given tasks before funds are disbursed to them.

2.1.3.  
Compensations/Acquisition of Right of Way for Selected Transmission Lines Projects

The Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals Development, is responsible for provision of policy guidance in the development and exploitation of the energy resources, creation of an enabling environment to attract investment, and provision and utilization of energy resources.

Currently, UETCL’s network consists of 2,989.2Km of high voltage lines distributed as; 1,008km of 220kv, 1,946km of 132kv and 35km of 66kv , with 25 substations with a total transformation capacity of 2829.5 MVA. However, this is still low, given that Uganda still has one of the lowest per capita electricity consumption in the world with 215 KWh per capita per year, given that the Sub-Saharan Africa’s average is 552Kwh 2 .

Government has spent significant amounts in compensation of Projected Affected Persons. In a period of 5 years, financial years between 2016/17 to 2019/20, a total of UGX.564.57Bn has been spent in compensations of PAPs.

The delays in undertaking the construction of the transmission lines has been largely attributed to inadequacies in the compensation of Project Affected Persons. The challenges faced in “Acquisition of the Right of Way (ROW)” have led to delayed implementation of a number of projects in the Energy Sector.

Owing to concerns over the progress of the implementation of the transmission infrastructure under UETCL, the Office of the Auditor General undertook an audit on the compensation of PAPs under selected transmission line projects. The overall objective of the audit was to ascertain whether the compensation process of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) was implemented in accordance with the Compensation Guidelines and other Government Legal Frameworks to enable efficient and effective service delivery.

The scope of the audit included the Grid Extension and Reinforcement Project (GERP) and the Mputa Transmission lines. The following are the summary of the key findings and recommendations made, and the details are in the thematic report on compensations;

Summary of Key Findings:

- 56% of the PAPs for GERP and Mputa projects were not properly identified, and this resulted in a mismatch between the number of PAPs appearing on the payment files and the survey reports and Valuation Reports prepared by the Chief Government Valuer.

- The valuation process was marred with a number of irregularities, which included; the use of un-updated district compensation rates; and unverified legal interests in the land; resulting in unnecessary revaluations and ligation which in turn delayed the RAP processes, thus affecting timely project completion.

- The budgeting, disbursement, and absorption of compensation funds were not properly managed. There are seemingly budget slacks. Although the Survey and Valuation Reports are supposed to guide the budgeting for compensations, management prepared budget estimates which were not supported, this resulted in over budgeting to the tune of UGX.111.3Bn.

- I noted that of the released compensation amount of UGX.21.5Bn for both GERP and Mputa Projects, only UGX.5.86Bn (27%) was paid to PAPs, thus resulting in unspent funds to the tune of UGX.15.64Bn (73%). This mostly affected the GERP Project which had UGX.13.17Bn not utilized, while Mputa had UGX.1.66Bn.

- I also noted significant delays in compensation of PAPs. 1,109 PAPs (52.2%) for Mputa and 821 (35%) for the GERP Transmission Line remained unpaid by the time of concluding the audit (November, 2021). This was mainly caused by outstanding grievances whereby 52% and 15% of the grievances remained unresolved for GERP and Mputa Projects, respectively. Relatedly, Compensations in kind also delayed whereby out of 149 PAPs identified, only 93 were resettled, leaving 56 PAPs not resettled.

- I noted a number of inadequacies in the construction of the resettlement houses which included; irregular payments to contractors, delayed progress of works, discrepancies in drawing specifications and BOQs, poor materials used for construction, and a number of defects which were not rectified.

Key Recommendations

- Management should always ensure that the RAP consultants thoroughly validate the preliminary information obtained during social survey and valuation processes, to enable accurate justification of PAPs
- The District Land Boards should ensure compensation rates are regularly updated and communicated to the CGV, to enable appropriate valuation of the land and properties.
- Management should streamline its RAP processes, including proper identification of PAPs, clear valuation processes, and timely submission of PAP documentation, among others.
- Management should ensure proper supervision and monitoring of construction works.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying my opinion, I draw attention to the following matters in the consolidated financial statements that in my judgment are of such importance and fundamental to users’ understanding of the financial statements;

- Government Loans (Borrowings) – UGX 69.6Tn

As disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the government Loans have increased from UGX.56.9Tn, in 2020 to UGX UGX 69.6Tn in 2021 constituting an increase of UGX 12,718Bn (22.4%) increase. This position reflects the country’s increased borrowing to combat the effects of the Covid19 pandemic.

- Domestic arrears – UGX 4.65Tn

As disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the domestic arrears have increased from UGX.3.83Tn in 2020 to UGX 4.65Tn in 2021 constituting a 21% increase. The amount represents 9% of the revised budget of government of Uganda for the financial year 2020/21. This is an indication of the failed commitment control system. The growth trend appears unsustainable and on the rise. This could also be as a result of approving supplementary budgets with no matching funding.

The PS/ST explained that government is currently implementing a Domestic Arrears Strategy to clear significant amounts of the verified arrears.

- Contingent Liabilities – UGX 160Tn

As disclosed in the statement of contingent liabilities, Government contingent liabilities have increased to UGX160Tn up from UGX.11.5Tn reported in the previous year, representing a 1,290% increase. Most of the contigent Liabilities are arising out of court awards and compensations. The trend continues to appear unsustainable in the event that a significant percentage crystallises into liabilities.

- Classified Expenditure – UGX 840.8 Bn

As disclosed under note 8, a total of UGX 840.8 Bn relates to classified expenditure. In compliance with Section 24 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (Classified Expenditure), this expenditure is to be audited separately and a separate audit report issued.

- Non-Consolidation of Subventions

It should be noted that this opinion excludes the details of expenditure worth UGX. 955Bn for subventions whose financial statements are not consolidated in the financial statements of the parent votes. Separate opinions were given on the individual financial Statements of the subventions.

16

---

Other Matter

I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements;

2.1.4. Tax policy  
a) Absence of clear policies to guide the Tax Exemptions and other Investor Incentives

Audit observed that there is no clear policy guideline for the issuance, management, and monitoring of the different tax benefits and incentives issued by the Government to different individuals. The absence of a clear mechanism and framework exposes the scheme to mismanagement and abuse.

For example, there were inconsistencies in the grant of tax benefits to the various beneficiaries, and some conflicted with earlier policy decisions that were made by Government. A review of the letter of undertaking/commitment signed by the Minister of Finance relating to an Industrial park establishment revealed that Government was taking over import duty and VAT on all materials and machinery imported by the beneficiary with the exception of steel items. However, a review of the Memorandum of understanding signed by the GoU and an Industrial park company investor revealed that there was no exception relating to steel.

It was also established that Government had offered a 10 year tax holiday to the steel sector with the aim of promoting the growth of the sector as well as boosting employment.

In light of the above, there is conflict in policy as presented in the above agreements and commitments. The Government may not achieve the objectives for having granted the 10 year tax holiday for the steel sector.

It was also noted that there is no mechanism in place for evaluating and or assessing the impact of the benefits granted. I noted 20 beneficiaries whose benefit period has since expired without follow up.

In the absence of a monitoring framework, Government is not in position to assess the impact of the tax benefits granted to the various beneficiaries. Government is bound to lose revenues that would have accrued if the beneficiaries were effecting payments and this may also cause unfair competition in the market.

Management indicated that the issue at hand would be solved by the ongoing development and implementation of the tax governance framework.

The PS/ST is advised to develop a comprehensive framework to guide the identification of beneficiaries/criteria, the nature of benefits to be granted, the duration of the grant and assessment mechanisms.

17

---

b) Continued loss of revenue due to Failure by Government to meet contractual obligations

The Government of Uganda (GOU), through the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, entered an agreement on 4 th April, 2003 with Oil Refinery company for the development of oil palm industry in Uganda. Under Article 5(7) of the Agreement, GOU was required to pay VAT on the products of the all companies envisaged under the project from the first year of the project activities and ending after a period of eleven (11) years from the year of handing over the 26,500 hectares of land. It was agreed that the company would then refund (subject to clause 3 of article 4) the VAT paid by the Government with interest over a period of eight (8) years in eight equal installments, including accrued interest starting in the twelfth (12 th ) year.

However, Government has breached the contract by failing to provide the balance of the 10,000 hectares of land as agreed. There is no documentation to show that the Ministry has made any follow-up on this matter.

Due to Government’s failure to provide the balance of the required land, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development has continued to settle all tax obligations on behalf of the Company. In the financial year 2019/20, the Minister wrote off a total of UGX.194Bn in line with the Tax Procedures Code Act (2019), being arrears as at 30 th June 2019 and also a total of UGX.79.8Bn was accumulated in the year under audit in arrears. Under the circumstances, it is apparent that instead of paying for 11 years, Government has so far paid for 17 years and is still continuing while the chances of recovery appear to be slim.

The continued failure to provide land continues to affect the Uganda Revenue Authority in its revenue collection efforts and also affects Government of Uganda revenue performance.

Management explained that Government has provided additional Land in Sango Bay bringing the total land provided to 22,500 hectares. The balance of 4,000 hectares is being sought in collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries. Once this is completed, the Company shall start refunding GoU taxes accumulated accordingly. The Ministry has further written to the Attorney General seeking advice on how the agreement can be amended.

I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the responsible agencies and ministries to expeditiously address the land issue. In the meantime, the PS/ST should also follow up with the Attorney General on the possibility of reviewing the terms of the agreement.

c) Continued build up of Government tax arrears; UGX.212.747Bn

Article 17 of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended) provides that it is the duty of every Citizen to pay taxes. Article 152(1) provides that no tax shall be imposed except under the authority of an Act of Parliament. The same Article provides that where a law enacted under the provision of the Article empowers any person to waive or vary a tax imposed by that law, that person or authority shall report to parliament periodically on the exercise of those powers as is provided for by the law.

The tax procedures Code Act (as amended in 2019) provides that the Minister shall pay taxes due and payable by the Government arising from any commitment made by the

18

---

Government to pay taxes on behalf of a person, or owing from the Government through the acquisition of goods and services. In addition, Section 40A (2) of the same Act provides that all unpaid taxes by Government as at 30 th June 2019 are written off. The Minister was tasked with gazetting the list of all taxes waived under the provision of Section 40A(2).

In compliance with the provision of the Tax procedure Code Act, the Minister issued a list of beneficiaries of the said tax waivers totalling UGX.809.734Bn. This was gazetted in the Uganda Gazette of 13 th March 2020. The write-off in question affected the tax heads and in amounts as summarised in table 4below;

Table 4: Tax arrears

| Nature of Tax | Total Amount written off (UGX) |  
|---|---|  
| Value Added tax (VAT) | 348,986,568,013 |  
| Stamp Duty 8,460,910,000 |<|  
| Pay As You Earn (PAYE) | 158,293,699,210 |  
| Import Duty 98,569,989,826 |<|  
| Excise Duty | 52,685,114,511 |  
| Income Tax 114,133,374,978 |<|  
| Withholding Tax | 28,604,598,593 |  
| Total  809,734,255,131 |<|  


It has however been noted, that one year later, a total of UGX.212.747Bn has already been accumulated at the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in tax arrears as 30 th June 2021. The occurrence is a manifestation that a tax write off is not the solution for the issue at hand. The tax arrears build up continues to negatively affect the revenue collection efforts of Uganda Revenue Authority.

Management responded that the writing off of tax arrears by the minister was consistent with the law, specifically Article 152 (1) of the Constitution and Section 40 of the Tax procedures Code Act. This discretionary power is useful because it addresses strategic circumstances which merit government interventions that were not provided for in the tax acts. Exercise of this discretion by the minister is reported to parliament every end of the quarter.

I advised the Accounting Officer to review the practice and come up with a lasting solution in respect of companies to which tax incentives and other benefits a granted.

2.1.5.  
Audit of public debt

a) Public Debt Portfolio Analysis

The reported total public debt as at 30 th June, 2021 stood at UGX.69,600 Bn, of which Domestic Debt Stock was UGX.25,288 Bn and the External Debt Stock was valued at UGX.44,312 Bn. This is an increase of UGX.13,429 Bn, equivalent to 23.9% when compared to the debt stock of UGX.56,892 Bn reported as at 30 th June 2020. The table below shows the details;

| June 17 | 11,407 | 22,102 | 33,509 ||  


Source: Audited financial statements of Vote 130

From the above, I noted that there was a consistent increase in the total debt and from financial year 19/20 to 20/21, there was an increment of UGX. 13,429Bn (23.90%). The net increase in the debt is due to increased borrowing from both the domestic and external sources, with domestic debt accounting for a higher increase.

Public debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. The graph below illustrates the trend of public debt stock by type over the past five years;

Although government has developed a domestic revenue mobilisation strategy, this appears not to be in harmony with the spending, raising concerns of sustainability.

Management indicated that revenue Mobilization had recently been affected by reduced economic activity as a result of restrictions imposed to slowdown the spread of COVID 19. COVID 19 has also led to additional expenditure pressures, which necessitated increased borrowing. Going forward, Government will focus on reducing expenditure and increasing revenues in a bid to bridge the fiscal gap and reduce the rate of debt accumulation. These commitments have been clearly spelt out in the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility, which is

20

---

awaiting Parliamentary approval. Further to the above, Government is finalising the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) that will improve alignment of government programmes and projects to suitable financing options. The Strategy will in turn enhance the efforts in resources allocation, utilisation and address issues on debt sustainability.

I await implementation of the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility. b) Assessment of debt sustainability

- Debt to GDP Ratio

Debt to GDP ratios is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a country to pay both internal and external debts and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates when lending due to the low credit rating of the country that pushes its lending risk high.

Though the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, the developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold.

A review of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a 6% increase from 41% last year to 47% in the year under review. The graph below illustrates the movement;

GDP

Debt to GDP Ratio 41.0

Jun 2016 Jun 2017 Jun 2018 Jun 2019 Jun 2020 Jun 2021

From the above, it can be seen that though Uganda’s GDP has been increasing over the years since 2013/14, its debt position has also increased. The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk of reaching unsustainable levels in the future.

Management attributed the increased debt levels to Government’s ambitious infrastructure program under National Development Plans I and II that were particularly focused on the energy (dams and power lines) and transport sectors. In addition, the need to expedite

21

---

commercial production of our oil resources has also necessitated the development of infrastructure which will aid the production process.  
It was also indicated that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a contraction in economic activity and shortfalls in domestic revenue collections while at the same time creating additional spending areas to mitigate the pandemic impact. To maintain debt at sustainable levels, Government had embarked on a fiscal consolidation strategy aimed at accelerating implementation of the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation Strategy and expenditure rationalisation.

I advised the PSST to consider exploring ways of reducing dependence on debt and expediting the implementation of strategies to enhance revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures.

- Interest to Total revenue ratio

This benchmark shows the proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestically-raised component of the budget only. Government set the ceiling to be 12.5% in its debt strategy. The table 6 below shows the assessment of the benchmark over the years;

Table 6: Total revenue ratio

| Financial year | Total domestic | Total Interest - UGX | % of Interest to | Benchmark |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
|| Revenue - UGX |<| revenue |<|  
| 2020/21 | 20,199,013,110,066 | 3,118,535,556,062 | 15.4 | < 12.5 |  
| 2019/20 17,453,981,414,553 2,475,531,497,733 14.2 < 12.5 |<|<|<|<|  
| 2018/19 | 17,128,743,726,614 | 2,005,380,900,988 | 11.71 | < 12.5 |  
| 2017/18 15,219,588,786,381 1,937,371,886,367 12.73 < 12.5 |<|<|<|<|  


It has been established that the interest to revenue benchmark has been breached as evidenced above. Almost 15% of the revenue being collected is going into servicing interest payments. This is gradually reducing the funds available for funding other critical government expenditures, given that 25% goes to salaries and wages.

Management indicated that efforts were being made to reduce the interest to revenue ratio by taking steps to reduce the level of domestic borrowing a view to attaining the operational ceiling of 1% of GDP and also working to increase domestic revenues through the operationalization of the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy (DRMS). The implementation of the DRMS had stalled in the last two years due to the pandemic-induced shocks. The DRMS aims to increase to tax to GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage points every year largely through the improvement of revenue administration.

I advised the PS/ST to implement strategies of reducing the growth of interest expenditures at the same time increasing revenue mobilisation.

- Low Tax to GDP ratio

Section 2.1 (i) Public Debt and other Financial Liabilities Management Framework for the FY2018/19 to FY2022/23 provides that the Government of Uganda shall work towards 22

---

raising its tax-to-GDP ratio to the Sub-Sahara Africa’s (SSA) average of 15.1% as part of Uganda’s Financing Strategy to limit on borrowing.

Audit reviewed the Country’s tax collections and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and noted that from the start of the implementation of the framework in the FY2018/19, Uganda had made an improvement and currently stands at 13%; however, more strides have to be made to make it to 15% and more. Refer to the table 7 below;

Table 7: Tax to GDP ratio

| Financial year | GDP at Current Prices | TAX collections | Tax/GDP |  
|---|---|---|---|  
|| (UGX) Billions | (UGX) Billions |<|  
| 2020/21 | 147,962 | 18,594 | 13% |  
| 2019/20 139,689 16,042 11% |<|<|<|  
| 2018/19 | 132,090 | 16,146 | 12% |  


The continued failure to collect sufficient revenue will imply more borrowing and creates a risk that the Country may not achieve the World Bank Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Management indicated that the Ministry’s tax expenditure analysis revealed that government was losing up to 1 to 2 percentage points of GDP per year, besides the fact that Government of Uganda informal economy is close to 50% of GDP. In addition, a VAT gap analysis carried out discovered a 40% compliance gap. The Ministry is implementing tax administration measures as part of the measures within the Domestic revenue mobilization strategy to improve tax to GDP ratio that include Automation of URA revenue collection systems through EFRIS, Digital Tax Stamps, Enhancement of ICT infrastructure, Installation of scanners at all customers border entry points, Improved Tax payer education, Implementation of a project to improve record-keeping by SMEs for improving compliance.

Management through URA also committed to ensuring increased tax compliance.

I advised the PSST to formulate policies that will further enhance domestic revenue mobilization. In the meantime, government should consider limiting its expenditure to within the limits of sustainable financing.

c)  
Continued securing of High cost Temporary advance from Bank of Uganda

Section 36 (3) of the PFMA 2015, stipulates that the Minister of Finance may raise a loan by issuing Government bills, bonds or stock or using any other method the Minister may deem expedient, including a fluctuating overdraft.

Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development requested for a temporary advance of UGX.2.1 Trillion from Bank of Uganda in line with the Public finance Management Act, 2015. The advance was granted on 1 st October 2020, the Bank of Uganda granted the request based on an average interest rate of the 272 day Treasury bill rate of 9.999%. Government paid an amount of UGX.98,770,218,774 as interest for the temporary advance due to delayed pay back.

23

The Accounting Officer indicated that the Ministry had embarked on negotiation with the central bank to adjust the interest rate to a fairer benchmark, though this still has to be in line with the Bank of Uganda Act which stipulates use of a market rate.

I await the outcome of the negotiations.

d)  
Absence of Policy to manage Interest rate risk

A Policy Framework serves as the guiding policy document for institutional development. The Policy Framework translates goals and objectives into attainable targets with outreaching impacts. Audit noted that the Treasury did not have a policy to manage interest rate risk. Without a Policy, there are no streamlined and institutionalized interventions that foster proper safe guards of public resources.

It was noted that the country continues to engage in the acquisition of debt with floating interest rates from Bilateral countries and Commercial Banks that use the ‘Libor’ and ‘Eurobor’ interest rates and thus the need for safeguards to be imposed.

It was further noted that the Government debt management policy on external debt does not give sufficient guidance on the use of instruments such as ‘SWAPs’ in risk management. As a result, most products are market-driven which is exposing Government further to new risks.

I noted that Government entered into a SWAP arrangement with two commercial banks towards the repayment a loan. A review of interest movements on the LIBOR revealed that Government has since made a financial loss of UGX.65,627,696,205 and has not yet benefited from the SWAP agreements with the two banks.

The Accounting Officer responded that the conclusion of the 15-year Interest Rate Swap transaction in June 2016 was a risk mitigating action against possible increases in US$ LIBOR which was made on the basis of historical US$ LIBOR rates. It could not take into account the ramifications of the CoVID-19 pandemic and the associated interventionist changes in US Monetary policy; as they were not evident in 2016. Current Indications are that restoration of market based interest rates will occur in the near future and hence pointing to the necessity to keep the SWAP in place as insurance against likely future interest rate increases. Government is currently undertaking a midterm review of the Public Debt Management Framework (PDMF) 2018. The proposed measure will therefore be considered and appropriate policy actions will be instituted for the remaining period of the framework and the longer term.

I advised management is to develop a policy on management of interest rate risk to minimise the exposure.

e) Failed on-lending scheme

G overnment of Uganda has over the years, secured funds for on-lending to various ministries, departments and agencies to undertake various projects. Whereas MDAs signed the on-lent loan agreements, there was an inability by some of the MDA’s to actually re-pay the on-lent loans. It was oserved that only Four(4) out of the Thirteen(13) MDA’s were found to be compliant with the repayment of the loans.

24

---

It was further noted that;

- There were no criteria in place to assess which MDAs to lend to.
- There was no record of assessment/ feasibility studies undertaken to establish whether the choice of on-lent financing was the best modality to finance the infrastructure projects.
- I noted that Government used non-concessional loans for on-lending, which attracted higher interest rates and shorter grace periods for the loan repayments as compared to the concessional loans which made it very costly. Some MDAs have had challenges with absorption and thus repayment.

Without a clear policy in place, the above shortcomings will continue to occur. This is causing a strain on government as funds are diverted to pay the loan obligations.

The Accounting Officer noted the observation and indicated that some of the beneficiary agencies that were not servicing the loans were taking various steps to have the issues resolved including seeking cancellations, write off loans by Government, and conversion of loan into equity among others.

G overnment should develop a clear on-lending policy if it continues to use the above option as a channel for funding projects.

2.1.6.  
Management of ICT in government

a) Failure to rationalize IT investments

Audit observed that there is massive duplication of IT systems and projects by the different MDAs attributable to implementation of IT initiatives in silos by the different MDAs. This has the effect of resulting into wastage of resources.

The isolated implementation of ICT initiatives also has the effect of compromising the standard of ICT infrastructure used by Government, which has the effect of compromising service delivery and wasteful expenditure on ICT systems that are not to be used.

Audit noted that several MDAs have procured several systems with the same functionality, established data centers, server rooms and disaster recovery sites to which the government has spent billions of shillings and the same continue claiming an annual maintenance fee. The major challenges, however, are that due to rapid technological changes, the investments require frequent upgrade infrastructure.

Audit noted that whereas the ICT strategy gives guidelines on the budgeting and acquisition of ICT systems including the involvement of the Ministry of ICT and NITA in ensuring standardization of systems and prevention of duplication of government systems, the continued individual actions by some MDAs has resulted in uncoordinated budgets and procurements of systems.

It is important to standardize, streamline and harmonize the budgeting, acquisition, deployment and disposal of IT services in Government to eliminate duplication; enhance information sharing and interoperability of e-government applications.

25

---

Management explained that rationalization of IT investments has been an ongoing activity spearheaded by NITAU. This activity resulted in a report which is still under discussion. Despite the desire by NITAU to rationalize IT investments, it is true that some Government Ministries, Departments and other Agencies have continued to procure own systems and Infrastructure. However, with the ongoing discussion, it is expected that rationalization of government’s investments in IT systems will be achieved.

I advised Government to expedite the ongoing rationalization and also streamline the budgeting and procurement of different ICT systems through seeking concurrence of the Ministry responsible for ICT and NITAU before funds for system acquisition are included in the budgets of MDAs.

b) Weaknesses in management of recoveries arising out of anti-corruption cases

Section 10(4) of the Anti-corruption Act, provides that in addition to any other penalty imposed upon conviction on a person order that person to make good the loss occasioned to the property; and the value of the property or damage to the property shall constitute a civil debt from the person to the Government or public body concerned and shall be recoverable from that person.

A review of decisions from the Anti-corruption Division of the High Court revealed that on several instances, the court has made orders as to refund of proceeds of corrupt practices by persons convicted. The following were observed;

- A sample of the cases reviewed revealed that a total of UGX.24,734,116,888 is outstanding as a result of decisions of the courts for refund of proceeds of corrupt practices but these are not provided for in the consolidated accounts as receivable.

- In my 2019/20 report for the DPP, I also observed that a total of UGX.18,940,206,109 remained uncollected in spite of the setup of a department within the Office of the DPP responsible for enforcing the recovery of compensation orders.

- The gaps in the collection were partly attributed to the lack of a clear mandate to the DPP, especially in so far as recoveries of compensation would require civil processes which are outside the mandate of the criminal mandate of the Office of the DPP.

- Whereas the mandate of recovery would be a reserve of the Attorney General who is vested with the mandate to litigate civil matters, it was noted that the ODDP has in place a unit for recovery of funds arising out of prosecutions in DPP while IGG also has another.

Failure to enforce the recovery of court orders, denies government the funds that should have been generated and undermine the objective of recovering losses incurred by the government due to corrupt practices.

It is therefore important that the Government comes up with a regulatory framework that addresses the inadequate legislation on recovery of proceeds of crime, provide for: civil asset recovery, detailed procedures in conviction based recovery, asset management and

26

---

disposal, recovery of consequential benefits, and how to apply the recovered proceeds, among others.

The Accounting Officer responded that the Ministry had initiated consultations with the Office of DPP, IGG and Attorney General for establishment of comprehensive procedures for recovery of proceeds of crime, provide for civil asset recovery, provide for detailed guidelines in conviction based recovery, provide for asset management and disposal, recovery of consequential benefits including application of the recovered proceeds.

I await the outcome of the consultations.

2.1.7.  
Audit of public investments

a) Failure to Appraise Projects before funding - UGX.643,434Bn

Section 3.18 of the Development Committee Guidelines provides that assessment of the project viability shall be measured by the following key indicators including: The Financial Cost Benefit Ratio (CBR), the financial Net Present Value (NPV) and the financial Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

The guide further requires that all new Projects requiring funding should undergo four levels of approvals before they can be admitted into the Public Investment Plan (PIP). The four levels include; preparing a project concept in line with NDP (II), preparing a Project Profile demonstrating Key results, undertaking a prefeasibility study and undertaking feasibility study.

Review of the Public Investment Plan for the year ended 30 th /06/2021, revealed that out of a sample of 371 projects, 245 projects (66%) with total Project values of UGX.643,434 Bn did not have feasibility studies undertaken.

Failure to conduct feasibility studies may lead to the projects failing to achieve the desired project output, duplication or conflicting Government interventions thus causing wasteful expenditure.

Management committed that going forward all projects will be appraised before inclusion in the PIP. In addition, the DC guidelines were being revised to take into consideration other exceptions, such as social projects, IT solutions among others.

I await the outcome of the commitment.  
b) Non-compliance with the 70% Capital Threshold

Section 2.2: Scope and Institutional arrangements of the Development Committee guidelines requires that Public investments admissible into the PIP shall be limited to public spending to acquire or establish physical assets necessary to facilitate production and delivery of economic, social and administrative services. Interventions that can be undertaken in the recurrent budget shall not be accommodated in the PIP. In this regard, for a project to be admitted into the PIP, its capital component shall account for at least 70% of the total project cost. It further states that interventions that can be undertaken in the recurrent budget shall not be accommodated in the PIP.

27

---

Audit reviewed the Public Investment Plan for the year ending 30 th June 2021 and noted that 125 projects in the PIP with total budgets of UGX.4,410Bn did not meet the requirement of 70% capital intervention. The aggregate project expenditure on administrative functions was 75% while the aggregate capital expenditure requirements were only 25% of the entire total budget. I noted that some projects had 100% administrative expenditure. Refer to the table 8 below;

Table 8: Noncompliance with the 70% capital threshold

| No. of projects | Total Budget - | Capital | Administrative | % of |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
|| UGX | Expenditure - UGX | expenditure - UGX | administrative |  
|^||<|<| expenditure |  
| 125 | 4,410,809,884 | 1,087,332,424 | 3,323,477,460 | 75% |  


If this remains unchecked by the development committee, the government runs a risk of spending project funds on recurrent expenditure and thus failing to meet the targets set in the National Development Plan III.

In addition, it was noted that the Development Committee does not consider software and intellectual properties as assets. This implies that any innovations in the ICT sector will continue to be unfunded, despite their potential to generative substantial returns.

Management explained that Section 2.2 applies to new projects to be admitted into the PIP and the budget. This requirement is fully adhered to by the DC but as projects continue into execution, recurrent costs can go higher, depending on the requirements between OPEX and CAPEX. The current DC guidelines are currently under review to provide for among others social projects, Grants, software investments and intangible assets, among others.

I advised the PS/ST to review the guidelines taking into account the project lifecycle and classification of assets to include intangible assets.

c) Overstay of projects in the PIP - UGX.39,011Bn

The Public Investment Management Reform Strategy provides that projects are supposed to be delivered on budget and on time in order to achieve the desired goals and objectives.

Audit observed that in the sample of 371 projects, 342 projects (92.2%) with budgets totalling to UGX.39,011Bn had gone past their planned exit periods, that date as far back as the FY2010/11, with some projects having been extended for more than 12 years. Audit noted that the projects continued to receive DC approval for continued stay on the PIP It was noted that only 40% of the projects in the Public Investment Plan (PIP) were still within their expected time period.

This was attributed to lack of adequate planning and readiness, delays in procurements, late acquisition of right of way, poor contract management and inadequate capacity to implement and evaluate ongoing projects, and unauthorized change in the scope, among others.

28

---

This has caused delays in the completion of key projects, cost overruns and high commitment fees on foreign debt on account of low absorption and failure to complete projects on time.

Management attributed the overstay to implementation challenges which often lead to extensions in the PIP. Management also informed me that the Ministry had now adopted the resolution not to admit any project into the PIP and budget before completion of all required feasibility studies and ensuring that challenges that often lead to project extensions such as delays in acquisition of right of way, Environmental and Social impact assessment, among others are fulfilled before project commencement. In addition, the Ministry’s leadership had directed that all old projects which continue to face implementation challenges either be cancelled and or renegotiated with the respective funders.

I advised the PS/ST to devise a mechanism to improve the efficiency with which projects are implemented by ensuring that the causes identified above are addressed.

d) Under absorption of funds by projects

According to the approved Budget estimates of the FY2020/21, the Resource Envelope of Financial year 2020/21 approved by Parliament totals UGX.45,493.7Bn of which External Financing consists of Project Support of UGX.9,515.3Bn and General Budget Support UGX.2,906.7Bn.

Audit obtained and reviewed cash inflows and expenditures of externally funded projects and noted poor absorption/performance of externally funded projects. Out of UGX.9,515.3Bn that was appropriated by Parliament, only UGX.4,516.5Bn (47%) was released. Relatedly, absorption of externally funded projects further declined in the year under audit. Out of the UGX.4,516.5Bn Disbursed for donor-funded projects, only UGX.2,937Bn was spent, representing 65.0% as compared to the 71% observed in the FY2019/20. The table 9 refers to;  
Table 9: Absorption of fund

| External | Release | Expenditure | Release | Expenditure | %of funds | %of funds |  
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  
| financing | (UGX) Bn | (UGX)Bn | Variance | Variance | not | not |  
| Budget |<|<| (UGX) Bn | (UGX) Bn | released | Absorbed |  
| (UGX)Bn |<|<|<|<| (UGX) Bn | (UGX) Bn |  
| 9,515.30 | 4,516.50 | 2,937 | 4,998.80 | 1,579.50 | 53% | 35% |  


The under absorption of externally funded projects in the FY2020/21 was mainly due to the following;

- Implementation of unready projects, unrealistic conditions precedent to disbursements of funds which constrains decision making during project execution;
- Covid-19 restrictions that affected implementation of projects
- Delayed land acquisition;
- Failure to quantify counterpart funding requirements at the time of project appraisal and;
- Cumbersome procurement processes as well as failure to undertake a comprehensive appraisal of projects.

Continued underutilization of external financing may lead to an increase in commitment charges and disadvantage other projects that could have utilized those resources efficiently. 29

---

Management explained that a number of measures have been introduced to improve project absorption as follows;

i)  
All projects to have feasibility studies before commencement and entry into the PIP, ii)  
Only sign loan agreements when conditions precedent have been fulfilled.  
iii)  
All readiness conditions including acquisition of right of way, availability of adequate financing etc. as stipulated in the Project Selection criteria should be met before admission into the PIP and budget,  
iv)  
Enforce and enhance contract management through adhering to procurement regulations and training of contract managers.  
v)  
A project management module in the Integrated Bank of Projects has been developed that will flag delay in a milestone and remind project managers on the required steps to facilitate expenditure.

vi)  
The Ministry is encouraging that Project management and implementation is undertaken by certified Project Management Professionals (PMP) who have the right skills, professionals and belong to a body that updates management knowledge. In this way project managers will be charged for underperformance which leads to low absorption.  
vii)  
Training of staff involved in loan and contract negotiations,  
viii)  
Undertake continuous training of staff in project appraisal, selection, execution, and ex-post evaluation,  
ix)  
Establish a Project Preparation Fund to support preparation of feasibility studies and provide resources for preliminary activities.  
x)  
Enforce the use of the Integrated Bank of Projects (IBP) for submission, preparation, execution and ex-post evaluation of projects,  
xi)  
Adjusting to alternative strategies and approaches for project execution in light of Covid -19 restrictions and protocols e.g. virtual platforms, shifts for workers, embracing mass vaccination among others,  
xii)  
Fast track approval of the revised PPDA regulations, train staff on timely initiation of procurement processes and execution of contracts,  
xiii) Applying sanctions and rewards to efficient and inefficient Accounting Officers, respectively.

I await the outcome of the above measures.

2.1.8.  
Continued expenditure off the IFMS – UGX. 695,372,792,876

The government of Uganda introduced the IFMS with a core objective of ensuring accurate, reliable and complete financial information for Government Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities as well as an increase in the transparency of public spending.

From a sample of ministries, it was observed that several entities which are already on the IFMS system, continue to send huge block figures outside the system after charging expenditure codes on the system; however, the ultimate expenditure cannot be restricted to what was charged. It was also noted that a number of entities post these funds to commercial bank accounts a practice that was stopped many years back.

30

---

It was also noted that a number of projects run by the various Ministries, departments and agencies are all spending off the IFMS. Although some of the bank accounts are held at Bank of Uganda, there are challenges of monitoring expenditure.

Management explained that whereas a significant amount of projects and subventions have been set up on IFMS either directly through being converted into Votes, the remaining subventions and Institutions are undergoing rationalization which will reduce the number of agencies off the IFMS. As explained, GoU is also undertaking a re-implementation of the IFMS which will have all projects aligned to departments under the parent Ministry.

The Ministry was to progressively set up the remaining agencies and stations as the exercise is ongoing coupled with resource availability to finance the IFMS rollout.

I advised the PS/ST to ensure that all government expenditure is made on the IFMS and also provide a road map to ensure integration of all projects onto the IFMS.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities, a statement from the Hon. Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, a statement from the Secretary to the Treasury, a statement from the Accountant General, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.

My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda.

The Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

31

---

The Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also;

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the government’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to fail to deliver its mandate.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other

32

---

matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19(1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of the GoU Consolidated Financial Statements that; except for the matters raised in the compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the GoU consolidated financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the consolidated financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

In accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of Government, with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

2.1.9.  
Use of prior financial years unspent funds

Article 154(1)(b) of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended), provides that no monies shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund except where the issue of those monies has been authorised by an Appropriation Act, a Supplementary Appropriation Act or as provided under clause (4) of this article. The Article further provides that no monies shall be withdrawn from any public fund of Uganda other than the Consolidated Fund, unless the issue of those monies has been authorised by law.

Section 17(3) of the Public Finance Management Act requires Votes which return funds to consolidated fund to revise their annual work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to take into account the unexpended money and the Minister responsible for the vote shall submit, as part of the budget for the preceding year, the revised work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan.

In the FY 20/21, it was observed that a total of UGX.26,098,586,831 was repaid into the consolidated funds from unspent monies from different votes. The said funds were however consequently utilized by the GOU without any form of appropriation.

The spending of funds by the GOU without appropriation of the said funds is irregular.

33

---

I advised the PSST to always seek supplementary approval from Parliament before using returned funds.

2.2 REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT

Opinion

I have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Local Governments, which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying Consolidated statements for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments for the year ended 30 th June, 2021 are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with Section 52(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Local Governments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

2.2.1.  
Payroll management in Local Governments

Over the years, several reforms have been implemented in payroll management including salary, pension and gratuity payroll management decentralisation. Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the management of payroll in the Local Governments (LGs).  
As a result, I considered payroll management in Local Governments as a Key Audit Matter and identified crosscutting risks including; unrealistic budgeting for employees and pension costs, under absorption of wage funds, delayed access

---

to the payroll, over payment of salaries, non-payment of salary and pension arrears, among others.

The wage and Pension Payrolls of UGX.2,586.47 Bn constituted 46.1% of the overall Local Governments budget for 2020/2021 of UGX.5,615.86 Bn.

I am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of payroll management activities. A number of Local Governments did not carry out planned recruitments resulting into huge unspent balances.

Consequently, I designed procedures to address the risks in the payroll management in Local Governments. (Detailed findings are provided in individual entity reports)

Based on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;

In addition, 85 LGs (79.4%) out of 107 delayed to remit the funds to UCLA/UBA, contrary to the requirement that payroll deductions are remitted concurrently with salary payments. The extreme delays were noted in the districts shown in the table below.

I further noted that 48 LGs (45%) out of 107 delayed to remit the funds to URA, contrary to the requirement that withholding agents remit to URA any tax that has been withheld or that should have been withheld within fifteen days after the end of the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the withholding agent. The extreme delays were noted in Mbarara MC, Kaberamaido DLG, Buyende DLG and Buhweju DLG of 8, 9, 8 and 11 months respectively.

Delayed/ non remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA could lead to delays in up-dating loan status with the various financial institutions causing un-necessary default charges on employees while delayed remittance of PAYE attracts fines and penalties from the Revenue Authority. It further led to accumulation of arrears that had not been paid by 30 th June 2021.

For the under payments, the Accounting Officers attributed it mainly to suspension of staff salaries due to disciplinary issues, delayed removal of staff from the payroll and delays in resolving issues such as abscondment where payments were withheld. For delays in remittance of deductions, the Accounting Officers attributed it to delays in reconciliation of interface deduction files. ii) Un-authorized loans deductions  I noted that 48 LGs made unauthorised loans deductions totaling UGX 11.10 Bn. The deductions were from 6,835 employees that lacked letters of consent/ undertaking. I further noted that out of the 48 LGs, 23 LGs (48%) registered 1,916 employees with deductions totaling to UGX 3.77 Bn that did not exist in the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS), operated by PCA-Payroll Consults Africa. There is a risk of making deductions from staff that have no loans, which deprives them of their earnings. The inconsistencies in the PDMS undermine the relevance of the system and affect the integrity of the data therein. The Accounting Officers acknowledged the shortcoming and explained that letters of undertaking were being signed although file copies were not being retained for future reference. They further explained that the inconsistencies in the PDMS data were attributed to PCA who largely control and manage the system. |<|<|<|<|<|<|

Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears.

The Accounting Officers noted the finding.

Other Matter  
I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements.

2.2.2.  
Implementation of the approved budget

A review of the Local Governments approved budgets of UGX 5,615.86Bn out of which UGX 4,328.01 Bn was warranted/ availed by the end of the financial year. The total expenditure for the year was UGX 4,147.90 Bn out of which UGX 2,853.55Bn was spent on employee costs and transfers to other units implying that only UGX.1,294.35 Bn was available for implementation of service delivery outputs.

From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following significant observations

| I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with line Ministries to revote the funds,  the activities and ensure they are subsequently implemented. roll over a) Absorption of released funds  Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX 4,328.01 Bn, UGX 4,147.90 Bn (95.8%) was spent by the Local Governments resulting in an unspent balance of UGX 180.11 Bn (4.2%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was remitted back to the consolidated fund account. Under absorption of released funds results in non- implementation of planned activities and negates the purpose for which funds were disbursed, thereby affecting the achievement of the objectives in the NDPIII. For example, implementation of USMID projects in Municipal Councils and UgIFT projects in DLGs was not undertaken. The Accounting Officers attributed failure to utilise funds to COVID-19 which affected the recruitment exercise, late release of USMID funds and delays in the procurement process and lotting policy of contract works under UgIFT. 2.1 |<|<|<|<|<|<|

|^| vaccination and funding to revive the economy for activities |<|<|<|<|<|  
|^| to resume and stimulate revenue collection. |<|<|<|<|<|  
|^||<|<|<|<|<|  
| ii) Revenue from External financing  The Local Governments budgeted to receive UGX 413.94 Bn as external/donor financing, out of which UGX 57 Bn (13.8%), was received  Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities.  The Accounting Officer attributed this to the fact that the Local governments did not receive indicative planning figures from the donors for proper and realistic budgeting for the Financial Year under review. |<|<|<|<|<|<|  
|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  


---

iii) Off Budget Financing/Receipts  
I advise Government through the Ministry of Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015 states that all expenditure Finance to negotiate incurred by the government on externally financed projects and mainstream Donor in a financial year shall be appropriated by parliament. funding in the Local Paragraph 29 of the Budget Execution Circular for the Governments Budgeting Financial year states that if an external agency provides Process.  
funds in the course of implementation of the budget or any  
funds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation,  
these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line  
with the Public Finance Management Act 2015.

I noted that 17 of the 86 LGs sampled received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX 14.20 Bn, which was never declared to the PS/ST and was also not appropriated by parliament. As such, no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PS/ST. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities, contrary to Section 43(1) of the PFMA 2015 and the budget execution guidelines issued by the PS/ST.

The Accounting Officers explained this was due to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such receipts and in some cases funds are received during the year which were not expected at the time of planning.

---

iv) Quantification of activities and Implementation of I advised the planned outputs  
Accounting Officers to ensure that work plans Section 13 (15, b) of the PFMA 2015 states that a policy and budgets are fully statement submitted by a vote shall contain the annual and quantified and ensure three months’ work plans, outputs, targets and performance that

for be used to gauge the performance of the outputs and funds  
implementation. allocated to each activity.

I sampled 86 entities for purposes assessing the extent of quantification and implementation of planned outputs I noted that out of the 850 outputs worth UGX 254 Bn sampled for review, 675 outputs (79%) worth UGX 182 Bn were fully quantified, 58 outputs (7%) worth UGX 34 Bn were partially quantified while 117 out puts (14%) worth UGX 38 Bn were not quantified at all.

Out of a total of 675 quantified out-puts worth UGX.182 Bn assessed, 475 (70.4%) output worth UGX 90.10 Bn were fully implemented, 172 outputs (25.5%) worth UGX 86.70 Bn were partially implemented, while 28 (4%) out-puts worth UGX 4.90 Bn were not implemented at all. The graph below shows the extent of implementation;

**Extent of implementation of quantified out- puts**

4% 26%

70%

Fully Implemented  
Partially Implemented

Not implemented

The Accounting Officers explained that implementation of activities was affected by the restrictions in movement imposed by government to curb the spread of Covid-19 and the fact that staff at the entities were working at 30% staffing levels. Failure to fully quantify the planned activities makes the assessment of implementation difficult while failure to implement planned activities denies citizens services.

2.2.3.  
Operationalization of New Cities

During the FY 2019/20 Government made a pronouncement upgrading ten (10) Municipal Councils (MCs) to City status effective 1 st July 2020. These include; Arua, Mbarara, Gulu, Jinja Fort portal, Mbale, Masaka, Soroti, Hoima and Lira

During my audit of the above cities for the F/Year 2020/21, I noted the following;

i) Government did not provide funding in the budgets of the newly created entities to enable them operate as cities. I noted that they continued to operate using the budgets of MCs.  
ii) The High Court in Masaka was petitioned by some individuals to review the guidelines issued by the Minister of Local Governments for the new cities on grounds that they contravened the procedures set out in the Local Government Act.  
iii) The cities lacked establishment structures against which the recruitment of the required human resource could be undertaken.  
iv) There was no guidance on the allocation/sharing of assets. This has become a contentious matter between the councils of the newly created cities and those of the hosting districts.

As a result of the above, the high expectations of both the local political leadership and the general public have not been met.

I advise Government to ensure that the new cities are fully operationalised.

2.2.4.  
Capitation Grant for Printing of Home Study Materials

The Government through MoES released UGX 23 Bn for printing of home study materials to facilitate home learning during the COVID 19 lockdown.

However, I noted that the study materials were not procured and the districts were advised to send the money to the school bank accounts with a condition that they should not spend until instructed to do so.

At the time of writing this report, the home study materials had not been printed and the funds were either used or lying idle on the schools’ bank accounts. Consequently, the objective of ensuring that learners continued to learn during the lockdown was not achieved.  
The Accounting Officers explained that no instructions were given as indicated by the MoES.

I advise Government through MoES to always provide timely guidance and coordination in such events that require urgent government interventions.

I also recommend that schools are given guidance on the utilization of the funds.

---

2.2.5. Un-Accounted for Funds

Section 43(2) of the of the Local Governments Financial and Accounting Regulations, 2007 require administrative advances to council employees to be authorized by the executive and accounted for within a month.

I noted expenditure of UGX 3.37 Bn paid out for implementation of various activities in the LGs remained unaccounted at year-end as shown below

Table 11: Entities with unsupported expenditure

| Sn | Entity | Amount (UGX) Bn |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1. | ABIM DLG | 1.41 |

In the circumstances, it was not possible to confirm that the funds were used for the intended purposes.

I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that funds are either accounted for or else be recovered from the responsible officers.

2.2.6.  
Irregular payment of Salary and Salary arrears to staff in Apac DLG

I reviewed the payroll data (IPPS) and the IFMS payments of Apac District Local Government and noted that the district irregularly paid out UGX 0.57 Bn to 25 individuals and to the estate of the deceased staff as salary and salary arrears without any supporting documentation. The amounts were irregularly expended leading to the overstatement of salary expenditure.

I observed that much as there were no payroll deductions made for Apac Municipal Council, Apac Sub County, Chegere Sub County, Ibuje Sub County and Akokoro Sub County, the district transferred a total UGX 0.06 Bn from the wage provisions to the same entities with no justification.

An interview with the Human Resource Officer revealed that these payments were not generated by the Human Resource Department.

The Accounting Officer explained that investigations were going on by CID Headquarters.

In the meantime, I have instituted a forensic audit on the matter.

---

2.2.7.  
Failure to submit Financial Statements for consolidation

Section 52(1)(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires that the Accountant General shall within three months after the end of each financial year prepare and submit to the Minister and the Auditor General the consolidated annual accounts of the local governments.

A review of the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments revealed that 3 District Local Governments and 6 Municipal Councils with a total actual expenditure of UGX 163.08 Bn were not submitted for consolidation by the respective Accounting Officers as shown table below:

Source: Consolidated financial statements and schedules

The Accountant General explained that without any justification, the above entities failed to submit the financial statements contrary section 51 of the PFMA, 2015. These accounts were therefore not quality checked for compliance by the Accountant General.

Failure to include all individual local government votes in the consolidated financial statements means that the consolidated balances of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities do not represent the actual Local Government consolidated position.

I advised the Accountant General to identify and address the specific challenges that prevented the entities from submitting their Financial Statements for consolidation.

2.2.8.  
Implementation of UgIFT project activities

**a)**  
Status of completion of projects

I undertook audit inspections of civil works in 24 Seed Schools and 41 Health Centre IIs located in a sample of 62 Districts and Municipal Councils and noted that 53 projects (80%) had not been completed, 11 projects (17%) had been completed while 01 project (2%) was not implemented. Notably, Amolatar, Oyam, Luwero, Sironko, Kamwenge and Kanungu Districts completed the construction of the seed schools and Health Centres.

The inspection results are summarised in the table below; Table 13: Status of implementation of UgIFT projects

| Grand Total 65 |<|<|<|<|<|  


Source: OAG analysis

I further noted that out of the 53 incomplete projects, 36projects had exceeded their planned completion dates by an average of 11 months.

The Accounting Officers attributed the delays in project completion to;

a) The Covid-19 lockdown measures which limited the movement of materials and labour,  
b) The contractors abandoning the sites,  
c) Funds not being re-voted to the entities in time,  
d) Delayed hybrid procurements,  
e) Late release of funds,  
f) Poor terrain leading to impassable roads to some projects sites,  
g) Low capacity of the contractor in terms of manpower, machinery, and multiple projects.

Consequently, the projects planned to be completed within the year were not completed, and as such the intended beneficiaries were denied services.

I advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with the sector Ministries to ensure that the implementation bottlenecks identified above are addressed.

---

**b)** Land Ownership  
The Circular issued by the MoFPED in May 2018 requested all Local Governments to ensure that all Government projects are constructed on land with proof of ownership or a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with landowners;

I observed 4 projects that did not have titles or MOUs for the land on which the seed schools and health centers were constructed as shown in the table below:

Lack of land titles exposes the projects to disputes.

I advised the Accounting Officers to acquire land titles or MoUs for all the UgIFT projects.

**c)**  
Procurement of ICT equipment, Laboratory kits, and chemical reagents  
The guidance on procurement of ICT equipment, science kits, and chemical reagents for seed schools by the Ministry of Education and Sports to all Accounting Officers on 28 th August 2020 referenced EPD 192/335/01; which required the procurement to be conducted after successful completion and handover of the facilities.

I noted that ICT equipment, Science kits and chemicals were procured for seed schools that had not been completed. The equipment were instead being kept in inappropriate storage facilities exposing them to a risk of obsolescence.

The Accounting Officers pledged to engage the contractors to ensure that construction works on the laboratories are completed.

I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that procurements for the equipment are only effected when the construction works have been

completed. I also urged the Accounting Officer to ensure that items are properly stored.

Other Information

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer; the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer; and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.

I have nothing to report in this regard.  
Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the local governments.

The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the local government’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the local governments’ financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.

---

As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also;

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the local governments’ internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the local government’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the local government to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

---

Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.

Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation  
There were no material findings in respect of the compliance with legislation.

2.3  
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021

2.3.1. Review of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises

According to Section 3 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended); “A Public Corporation means an authority established by an Act of Parliament other than a local Government which receives a contribution from public funds, and any public body which in a financial year receives any income from public funds”. Similarly, “A State Enterprise means a body established under any Act other than the Company’s Act or a local Government council, and a company registered under the company’s Act in which the Government or a state enterprise has controlling interest”.

In line with the PFMA, 2015, I reviewed the Consolidated Summary Statement of the Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises for the year ended 30 th June 2021, and noted the following;

**a)**  
Completeness of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Performance

Section 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires the Accountant General, within three months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Minister responsible for Finance and the Auditor General the consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of Public Corporations, State Enterprises and Companies where Government has controlling interest.

I noted that 46 public corporations and state enterprises were supposed to be consolidated in accordance with Section 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015. However, I noted that seven (7) entities were not consolidated in the consolidated summary statement submitted by the Accountant General.

Furthermore, Government shareholding in twelve (12) Public Corporations and State Enterprises was not disclosed in the consolidated summary statement of performance. This was caused by the absence of a comprehensive register of Public Corporations and State Enterprises.

In the absence of a complete register of all consolidating public corporations and state enterprises, I was not able to ascertain the completeness of the submitted consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporation and state enterprises.

I advised the Accountant General to establish a comprehensive register of all Public Corporations and State Enterprises with detailed information required for consolidation.

**b)**  
Failure to submit financial statements for consolidation

---

Section 51(2) of PFMA, 2015 provides that, the Accounting Officer of a public corporation shall, within two months after the end of each financial year, using the format prescribed by the Accountant-General, prepare and submit to the AccountantGeneral, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury.

A review of the consolidated summary statement of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises revealed that two (2) entities did not submit performance returns to the Accountant General for consolidation as indicated in the table 15 below;

Table 15: Entities not Consolidated, but Disclosed in summary statement

| S/N | Enterprise | Government Holding |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1. | Uganda Air Cargo Corporation | Not ascertained |  
| 2\. Uganda Refinery Holding Co  Not ascertained |<|<|  


**c)**  
Missing Entities in the consolidated summary statement

Section 52(1) c of PFMA 2015 as amended requires the Accountant General within three months after the end of each financial year to prepare and submit to the Minister and the Auditor General a consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises and Companies where Government has a controlling interest.

I noted that three (3) entities were neither reported nor disclosed in the consolidated summary statement of performance. (Table 16 below refers).

Table 16: Entities neither reported nor Disclosed in the consolidated summary statement

| S/N | Enterprise | Remarks |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Uganda National Oil Company Limited | Not reported in the previous year |  
| 2  Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium  Not reported in the previous year |<|<|  
| 3 | Uganda Crane Industries Ltd. | Not reported in the previous year |  


This implies that the consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises does not reflect the accurate status of government ownership and interest and as such I was unable to assess and conclude on their performance.

I advised the Accountant General to issue comprehensive guidelines in respect of all Public Corporations and state Enterprises to be consolidated to enable assessment of financial performance.

---

2.4.1 Review of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises

The Government of Uganda (GoU) owns shares in a number of Public Corporations and State Enterprises. These enterprises, which are independently managed, are supposed to operate efficiently, make profits and pay dividends to Government. Their financial performance is therefore of interest to Government.

As noted in my previous reports, the Government Consolidated Summary Statement of financial performance of public corporations and State enterprises only reports on; government shareholding, total income, total expenditure, dividends declared, retained earnings, and net worth of entities. However, key performance assessment parameters, such as; profitability, return on assets, liquidity assessment, long-term debt, and interest cover are not reported on. As a result, I computed these ratios using audited financial statements for further analysis of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises, where applicable.

Out of the 46 Public Corporations and State Enterprises, seven (7) entities were not assessed because they had not submitted audited accounts at the time of writing my report. Table 17 below refers;

Table 17: Entities not assessed

| S/N | Entity | Government Stake |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1. | Uganda National Oil Company Limited | 100% |  
| 2\. Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium  100% |<|<|  
| 3. | National Housing and Construction Company Limited | 51% |  
| 4\. Uganda Telecom Limited  Not known |<|<|  
| 5. | The Micro Finance Support Centre Ltd | 100% |  
| 6\. Uganda Seeds Limited  100% |<|<|  
| 7. | Uganda Livestock Industry | 100% |  


From the financial performance analysis undertaken, I noted the following; a) Profitability of Enterprises

I noted that thirteen (13) out of the twenty-six (26) Public Corporation and State Enterprises analysed made profits/surplus in the year under review, with Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), Uganda Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL) and National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) posting profits of UGX 112Bn, UGX 91.9Bn and UGX 47.8Bn, respectively. Table 18 below refers.

| 26. | Uganda National Airlines Company Limited | (164.60) | (102.45) | (62.12) |  


The general performance of some of the Public Corporations and State enterprises slightly improved compared to the previous year with companies such as Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), Uganda Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL) and National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) posting more than double the profits of the previous year. This was mainly attributed to government efforts to ease several COVID-19 restrictions, allowing certain businesses to reopen and government intervention of revamping the economy.

I further noted that entities including Uganda Railways Corporation, Kilembe Mines Limited, Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) and Uganda National Airlines Company Limited made losses as at the end of the financial year. However, it should be noted that this is the second year of operation of Uganda National Airlines in a highly competitive industry.

---

I advised the entities to develop clear strategies to improve operations and adopt efficient financial management practices to lower operating costs and increase revenue generation. Government should also consider recapitalizing the most affected entities to revamp their operations.

b) Return on Assets

The Return on Assets (ROA) shows the percentage of how a company’s assets are generating revenue. It measures management’s efficiency in using the enterprise’s assets to generate earnings. Although companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets, ROAs below 5% are generally considered inadequate.

Apart from eleven (11) companies, which include; Uganda Wildlife Conservation education Centre, Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited, Kira Motors Corporation, Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation, Insurance Training College, NEC Constructions Construction Works and Engineering Limited, NEC Uzima, NEC Luwero, Insurance Regulatory Authority of Uganda and National Drug Authority which posted a favourable ROA, the rest of the entities where the ratio is applicable, registered a poor performance on ROA of below 5%.

c) Dividends

I noted that, only Uganda Property Holdings Limited and Housing Finance Bank Limited proposed a dividend pay-out of, UGX 400,000,000 and UGX 1,495,222,000, respectively, in the year under review, Nile Hotel International Limited, Uganda Development Corporation (Group) and Housing Finance Bank Limited paid out dividends declared for the previous year totalling UGX. 2,269,944,381.

I further noted that although some companies were making significant amount of profits, they were not paying dividends to Government.

The enterprises attributed the non-payment of dividends to the loss-making positions and retention of funds to fund planned investments/projects.

I advised the Accountant General to ensure that profit making enterprises provide a share of government dividend.

d) Liquidity Assessment

I analysed the ability of Public Corporations and State enterprises to meet their short-term financial obligations by comparing the current assets and current liabilities using the Current Ratio analysis. Generally, the ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities between 1.5 and 2 is desirable, although acceptable current ratios vary between different industries or sectors.

I noted that eighteen (18) entities were above the ideal threshold, implying that they are able to meet their liabilities as they fall due. three (3) entities had ratios below 1.0 and may have a challenge of paying their obligations as and when they fall due. The table 20 below refers.

Table 20: Enterprise Liquidity

||| Current Ratio |<|  
|---|---|---|---|

In addition, I noted that the customer deposits in the four banking institutions grew to an average of UGX.344Bn up from UGX.264 Bn in the prior year. Relatedly, the loan to deposit ratio averaged to 66% up from 64% which is still desirable at individual bank rating. The Table 21 below refers;

I further noted that despite the low activity during the COVID-19 period, Loans and advances to customers increased on average from UGX.336Bn to UGX.405Bn in the current year.

The performance of the 4 institutions was commendable. e) Interest cover

I analysed the interest cover of Public Corporations and State enterprises that had taken loans to establish their ability to service the loans through payment of interest. Interest cover looks at how many times a Company’s operating profits exceed its interest payable. A cover of two (2) times and above is usually considered to be safe, depending on the nature of industry. The implication is that a company is most likely to meet its interest payments.

I noted that of the 3 companies/enterprises which were financing loans, two (2) (NWSC and the Insurance Training College) were better placed to meet their interest obligations, while the New Vision Printing and Publishing Company Limited was not. The Table 23 below refers.

Overall Conclusion/Recommendation

Whereas government policy to invest in critical sectors of the economy is commendable, it is important to ensure that such investments are operating efficiently and effectively to meet sector objectives. There is need for government to strengthen the supervision and monitoring of these entities.

Although government efforts to ease several COVID-19 restrictions, allowing certain businesses to reopen improved performance of certain enterprises, the COVID 19 pandemic affected operations of a number of entities, and Government needs to assess its impact on the critical enterprises and corporations and provide the necessary guidance and assistance.

PART 3: SECTORAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CROSS CUTTING FINDINGS

This part contains cross cutting key findings noted in the respective sectors and cross cutting service delivery issues in Local Governments.

3.0. Sectoral Key Findings  
3.1. PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT  
3.1.1. Government readiness to implement the programmatic approach

Government with effect from 1 st July 2020 started the implementation of NDP III as a successor plan to the NDP II. The overall objective of the NDP III is to increase household income and improving the quality of life of Ugandans. This plan is implemented using the programme approach to planning, budgeting, implementation and results reporting. This programme was also designed to address challenges faced in implementation of prior national development programmes which included uncoordinated planning, weak harmonization, limited sequencing of programmes, and poor linkages between outcomes and outputs.

I reviewed the readiness of government to effectively implement the NDP III in order to achieve the desired outcomes. From the procedures undertaken, I noted that significant strides have been made towards effective implementation of the plan.

Areas of commendable performance include; provision of guidelines to entities to facilitate transitioning to programme approach, development of the Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) for all programmes, development of strategic plans that are aligned to the NDP III by a number of entities in government, operationalization of Programme Working Groups (PWGs) to coordinate programme activities and development of guidelines for the programme working groups.

Despite these achievements, there are a number of areas that need government attention if the NDP III overall objective is to be achieved. These include;

a) The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting requires tracking progress towards attainment of results. This therefore implies that accountability and oversight processes should be re-aligned towards achievement of results as defined in the NDP III framework. This realignment has however not been fully attained.

b)  
The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also requires a shift of the current government statistical processes to processes that are capable of delivering outcome statistics as defined in the NDP III. The current data systems therefore have to be revised so that they produce results data rather than output data. In addition, surveys and production of key results statistics need to be aligned to the NDP III M&E processes to enable real time capture of data and monitoring of the achievement of programme results.

c)  
The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also implies that government annual performance reporting will now be based on programmes rather than sectors. The challenge however is that a number of programme

---

working groups are still struggling to constitute themselves in order to do effective programme reporting which is likely to affect effective coordination and supervision of programme activities.

d) The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also implies that budgets of MDAs and LGs are now developed and approved at programme level although appropriation and spending remain at vote level. However, a number of MDAs are grappling with understanding the new system.

With 2 years into the implementation of NDP III, a number of MDAs and LGs have not fully transitioned their operations to the new programme based planning and budgeting and this is likely to affect the achievements of the NDP III objectives.

Government should support the National Planning Authority in capacity building of MDAs and LGs staff such as planners, monitoring and evaluation officers among others to equip them with the necessary skills to track and evaluate the implementation of entity plans in line with the NDP III PIAPs.

3.1.2. Limited efforts to build the capacity of planning units within Government

Section 7 (2) (d) provides that in pursuance of its primary planning functions, the Authority shall support local capacity development for national planning and, in particular, provide support and guidance to the national and local bodies responsible for the decentralized planning process.

I have noted over the years that MDAs and Local Governments face significant challenges in planning, implementing, monitoring and reporting performance due to low capacity of their planning units. I however noted that although the mandate of the Authority provides for supporting the development of local capacity in planning, the Authority had not effectively executed this mandate. No trainings for planners had been undertaken by the Authority in the past three (3) years as a deliberate strategy to build planning capacity both at national and local levels.

Failure to build planning capacity within the Government implies that there will be persistent challenges in the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of performance in relation to the approved budgets, which affects service delivery and the credibility of the budgets both at entity and government-wide level.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Authority developed a National Capacity Enhancement Project for strengthening planning capacity at decentralized level in 2017 however no funds were availed and the activity has persistently remained as an unfunded priority.

I advised Government to have this critical activity funded, especially with the implementation of the roll out of the new NDP III which has taken effect.

3.2. SECURITY SECTOR

3.2.1.  
Monitoring and Supervision of Government Programmes under Office of the President

The Office of the President is mandated to follow up implementation of government programmes across the Country. However, the Office has staffing as well as office accommodation challenges which has limited adequate monitoring and supervision of the implementation of the programmes. The Office has a staffing gap of 80 positions of Senior Presidential Advisors, Resident District Commissioners and Deputy Resident District Commissioners.

In addition to the staffing gap, the RDCs lack enough accommodation. During the year under review, the Office of the President had a deployment of 146 RDCs in Districts and 10 RCCs in newly created cities out of which 107 are renting and 24 lack offices.

In order to address the above challenge, the Office envisioned an idea of constructing at least 10 RDC offices per annum in a phased approach starting with FY 2008/09. This idea was not fulfilled because government could not fund the capital budget as anticipated. This has necessitated the Office of the President to revert to constructing only one RDC office per annum as the case is currently and renting office space for the rest. Under this approach, the Office will take 107 years to construct offices for all RDCs and spend approximately UGX.445Million on rent annually.

I have advised Government to ensure that the RDCs and RCCs are recruited and also develop an action plan for construction of offices in a phased manner to minimise the high operation costs.

3.3. AGRICULTURE SECTOR  
3.3.1. Mainstreaming of Agriculture Sector agencies

Government is still in the process of rationalizing agencies and public expenditure (RAPEX) under the Agricultural Sector which include Cotton Development Organisation, Uganda Coffee Development Authority, Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis and Diary Development Authority. These entities have had challenges of attracting staff to undertake activities. The respective Accounting Officers attributed this challenge to the following:

- Some successful candidates did not take up the job offers because the contract period was limited to only 18 months as recommended by Ministry of Public Service.

- The Ministry of Public Service and Solicitor General guided that recruitment of staff for the agencies affected by rationalization should only be for a period up to June 2023.

- The employment contracts should contain a disclaimer clause to the effect that the employment can be terminated any time without recourse.

- There is no guarantee of retention of the workforce.

The above situation has affected the agencies also in other areas of planning, execution of activities and implementation of the new NDP III strategic plans.

---

I advised Government to fast-track implementation of the policy with a view of ensuring that the on-going rationalization activities are finalized in the shortest time possible to avoid further disruptions in the operations.

3.3.2. Over dependence on the Public Private Partnership in the Cotton sector

Section 5 (i) of the Cotton Development Organisation Act, vests the duty to facilitate cotton production, cotton research and extension through the Ministry responsible for agriculture to CDO. CDO’s mandate is to promote production, monitor marketing and processing of cotton and represent all aspects of the cotton subsector.

Over the last 11 years, the Private Sector (Ginners) under their umbrella body Uganda Ginners and Cotton Exporters Association (UGCEA), have been supporting cotton production activities under the Cotton Production Support Program through a Memorandum of Understanding that is signed annually between CDO and UGCEA. The Program, using funds pooled voluntarily by UGCEA members into the Cotton Development Fund (CDF), supports a variety of activities which aim to assist cotton farmers in Uganda to increase cotton production and productivity through; provision of inputs, farmer mobilization and sensitization, extension services and agricultural mechanization.

It was noted that UGX.19.649Bn was budgeted to cater for the cotton marketing season 2020/21 out of which, UGX.15.154Bn was budgeted towards provision of planting seed and production inputs. Government was able to contribute only UGX.8.6Bn leaving the balance for the private partner intervention. This is an indication that government is relying more on the ginners to fund the cotton sector.

Despite the intervention by the private sector, there were shortages in provision of inputs to farmers. From table below, 866 Mt of planting seed, 374.6 Mt of fertilizers and 2,260 spray pumps were not provided as projected in the strategic plan despite the support from the Ginners which directly affected the performance of the sector in achieving the desired cotton production targets.

Table 24: Comparison of consolidated quantities of production inputs

---

Dependency on the Private sector for a key production activity such as provision of seed for planting and production inputs, risks the sustainability of the sector and enables the private sector to exercise influence over farmers through paying of low prices for the farmers’ crops. Further, inadequate Government funding limits CDO’s interventions in key aspects such as targeted extension services for mobilizing farmers and training them on cotton agronomical practices using demonstration gardens established at village/parish level.

Management explained that limited government has affected the cotton production in the past 2 years. There was a drop in cotton production from 173,457 bales of lint in FY 2019/20 to 50,709 bales in the year under review largely as a result of heavy rains, meagre funds for procurement and distribution of production inputs as well as provision of extension services. The calamity of drop in the cotton production was brought to the attention of both the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry & Fisheries and the Ministry of Finance, Planning & Economic Development and a request for a supplementary budget of UGX.5 billion was made.

I advised the Accounting officer to continue liaising with the line Ministry and MoFPED to forge a way forward for the sector.

3.3.3. Management of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Outbreaks in the Country

It is the Mandate of MAAIF to regulate and control the prevalence of FMD within the country. Accordingly, Government intervened by procuring FMD vaccines from Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute (KEVEVAPI) and Botswana Vaccines Institute (BVI) which were distributed to farmers across the country especially in the areas where FMD has been reported previously.

In June 2021, the country was informed of unprecedented outbreaks of FMD along the cattle corridor. A review of management of the outbreak revealed failure of timely interventions as a result of challenges faced in the procurement of vaccines despite the availability of funds. Furthermore, the following shortcomings were noted;

a) During the financial year 2019/2020, 700,000 doses of FMD were procured in November 2019, however, only 500,000 (70%) of the consignment was delivered and significantly late by 4 months.

b) 2,311,000 doses were planned to be procured in 2019/2020 however the supplier failed to deliver despite emergency situation and sensitivity of the disease.

c) Although the supplier later delivered 1,700,000 doses (52%) during the year 2020/2021, and 2021/2022 financial year, the balance of 611,000 doses (24%) were still outstanding at the time of writing this report. The deliveries have not been made even after several delivery extensions to the supplier.

The continued presence of the FMD and the inadequate response in terms of vaccine availability has denied Ugandans opportunities to export livestock and livestock products to the international market and significantly curtails the Ministry’s ability to achieve its mandate.

---

I advised the Accounting Officer to effectively and efficiently monitor such disease outbreaks within the Country so as to curb the spread and prevent further loss to the Community. Further, research collaborations with NARO should be enhanced for development of a local intervention.

3.4.  
JUSTICE LAW AND ORDER SECTOR

3.4.1.  
Management of cases and Case backlog

Various stakeholders in the Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS) have implemented a number of management information systems as indicated in the table 25 below.

Table 25: Information Systems within the JLOS Sector

| SN | Information system | Purpose | Entity | Cost (Bn) |

Institutions require quick access to accurate, and reliable information in order to function well and promote the objectives of equitable justice for all. In pursuance on the goals of criminal justice, various entities within the sector have acquired computerised information management systems to enable them attain their mandate.

Although Government has invested a sum of UGX.36.46Bn in four of the systems for the administration of Justice across the JLOS sector, I noted that the systems are stand- alone and decentralized without being integrated to enable information sharing across the sector.

The lack of systems’ integration inter-linking the various entities such as the Police, Directorate of Prosecution, Judiciary and Prisons implies that the transfer of case details between stakeholders for the quick resolution of cases in the pursuit of Justice cannot be achieved. The absence of shared or integrated management systems may also result in inefficient allocation of resources, higher costs of procurement for IT hardware, network equipment and application software as well as duplications in the nature of service support from the suppliers/vendors of the applications and the hardware.

---

I also observed that the implementation or setup of some of the systems is still ongoing in various entities. For instance, the Crime Records Management System in Uganda Police, the Prisoner’s Information Management System in the Uganda Prisons, the Electronic Court Case Management Information System in Judiciary, the Suspect Profiling System in Uganda Police were still at the pilot testing stage or were yet to be fully rolled out and operationalised across all the regional offices countrywide.

This may have resulted in the non-optimal use of the information assets held on the systems.

The JLOS sector should review the existing systems and their functionality vis-à-vis the sector-wide needs with a view of achieving an integrated approach to information management within the sector, in order to avoid the duplication of data, delays in processing cases, and achieving efficiency in resource allocation across the sector so as to attain the goals of criminal justice administration.

3.4.2.  
Operationalisation of the Joint Venture Agreement

In 2017 the Government of Uganda entered into a Joint Venture Agreement resulting in the formulation of the Uganda Securities Printing Company (USPC) for the exclusive production and supply of all security documents for the Government of Uganda, including National Identity Cards and Birth and Deaths Certificates. This venture had delayed to be operationalised and as a result a number of challenges were identified;

a) NIRA was expected to order a minimum of 4,500,000 national ID cards annually, starting with the financial year 2020/2021. However, no order was placed for the financial year under review due to lack of budget provisions for this activity. This is a breach of the contract agreement, which may result in the payment of fines for breach of contract.

b) USPC was yet to supply IT systems and equipment to support the National ID system and the birth and death registration system. The system in use for Identification Information was supplied by M/S Mühlbauer Uganda Limited, whose contract had expired and was not renewed. There is a risk that NIRA will operate without system support from the system vendor of the legacy (existing) system for an unspecified time.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Authority has been engaging USPC to resolve all the issues relating to the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and an Adhoc committee had been put in place comprising of all Permanent secretaries, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose objective is to review the status of implementation of the JVA every quarter.

I advised Government to design a clear road map and strategy to ensure compliance with the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, including developing support systems to avoid the stalling of operations of the entity.

---

3.5. INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

3.5.1.  
Absence of a National IT Governance/Oversight System

I noted that Government did not have a national IT governance framework that establishes a proper IT governance structure and system.

The objective of an IT Governance system is to enable Government to; provide for strategic direction for ICT investments; prioritise and ensure strategic alignment of IT and e-government investments across Government; mitigate risks associated with the use and/or investments in ICT such as duplication of IT systems and wasteful expenditure; and optimise the use of ICT and e-government services, among others.

As a result, there is a lack of strategic insight in IT investments, and the Government may fail to optimise the use of existing ICT infrastructure. In addition, the Country lacks competitiveness in harnessing opportunities in ICT.

I advised Government to consider establishing a national IT Governance Framework and structure to oversee investments in information and communication technologies.

3.5.2.  
Failure by MDAs to Pay for National Backbone Infrastructure Services

NITA-U provides NBI/EGI services to MDAs and Local Governments whose ICT budgets have been either consolidated or not consolidated under NITA-U's ICT budget. Currently, fifty-four (54) entities whose ICT budget is consolidated under the ICT sector budget, while the ICT budget for 72 entities are not consolidated. Out of seventy-two (72) entities, only ten (10) entities have honoured their obligations. This has led to the accumulation of domestic arrears totalling UGX.22.96Bn as of 30th June 2021.

The arrears largely relate to the costs of expanding the national backbone/e- Government infrastructure (NBI/EGI). Notably, domestic arrears accounted for 14% of the annual GoU budget for the Authority, which is not only unsustainable but may lead to difficulties in the provision and extension of e-government services throughout the Country.

I advised management to liaise with MoFPED in consultation with MDAs to ensure that the ICT budgets are consolidated under the ICT Sector budget.

3.5.3.  
Uncollected Revenue from Media Operators

I noted that UCC stopped invoicing government bodies, namely: Uganda Telecom Limited (in-Administration), Uganda Broadcasting Corporation and Uganda Post Limited, for licensing and other charges. A review of the financial statements of these Government agencies revealed an un-invoiced amount of UGX.50.9 Bn. Management attributed it to the financial distress of these companies and the URA's tax policy of invoicing for VAT based on invoices raised by taxpayers, whether paid or not.

I noted that UCC did not issue invoices worth UGX.421.9Million to 15 operators (4 television operators and 11 FM broadcasting stations) during the period under review, contrary to its financial regulations.

---

Relatedly, UCC has not enforced the payment of a 2% gross annual levy on the licensed Television and FM radio operators gazetted in 2017, contrary to Section 68(1) of the UCC Act 2013. Management explained that the operators had appealed to the Minister of Information, Communication Technology & National Guidance.

I advised management to engage all stakeholders and collect the levies due.

3.5.4.  
Lack of a Communications Tribunal

During the audit, I observed that the Commission does not have a Tribunal contrary to Sections 60(1 & 2) and 64(1) of the Uganda Communications Act, 2013. The tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters relating to communications services arising from decisions made by the Commission or the Minister under this Act.

In the absence of the tribunal, the Commission lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine matters arising from decisions made by the Commission or the Minister under this Act. Currently, the matters are being heard by the Minister and the Commission, which creates a conflict of interest.

The Accounting Officer explained that the responsibility to appoint the tribunal does not reside with the Commission and that the tribunal is to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, and that the matter had been brought to the attention of the Minister of ICT and National Guidance.

I advised management and the Board of Directors to liaise with the relevant authorities to constitute the Communications Tribunal.

---

3.6. ACCOUNTABILITY SECTOR

3.6.1.  
Approval of supplementary funding without matching revenue

It was established that during the financial year ended 30 th June 2021, supplementary funding totalling UGX.6.13Tn was granted by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. It was however, noted that the source of funding for the supplementary expenditure was not clearly shown before approval was granted.

As a result, the supplementary expenditure was instead financed by internal budget cuts from various votes, thus affecting the implementation of plans/activities by the affected votes. Although the budget was raised from UGX.45.495Tn to UGX.51.625Tn, only UGX.46.6Tn was realised, resulting in unfunded activities worth UGX.4.98Tn.

3.6.2.  
Underperformance in Revenue Collection

I observed that, URA had a total revenue collection target of UGX.22.04Tn for the financial year 2020/21 and collected total gross revenue of UGX.19.65Tn (89%) hence a shortfall of UGX.2.39Tn (11%). Under collection of revenue affects cash flow performance of Government and realisation of the planned service delivery targets. In addition, it may increase the national debt burden as the Country may fail to honour its obligations and borrow more to address revenue shortfalls. Management attributed the performance to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I advised management to continue implementing strategies to enhance revenue collection.

3.6.3.  
Performance of the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP)

During the financial year 2020/2021, the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP) registered only 167,211 taxpayers against a target of 436,869 taxpayers representing 38.27% registration success a shortfall of 61.7%. In revenue terms, although TREP had a revenue target of UGX.124.58 Bn in FY 2020/21, it had only collected UGX.49.93Bn by 30th June 2021, representing a 40% performance rate. In addition, the Ministry of Local Government had planned to implement activities worth UGX.4.4Bn under TREP activities but only implemented activities worth UGX.3.3Bn, leaving un-implemented activities worth UGX.1.1Bn despite receiving full funding. As a result, the e-LogRev objective of simplifying and strengthening the local revenue collection systems for Local Governments may not be achieved in time.  
The paltry performance was attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that has set back many businesses, political riots and limited staff at the various stations because URA TREP officers had been laid off, thus resulting in limited staff capacity to conduct enforcement.

I advised the project management to review their strategies to enhance performance by agreeing on improvement plans to meet the project target.

3.6.4.  
Overstay of projects in the Public Investment Plan (PIP)-UGX.39.01Tn

The Public Investment Management Reform Strategy provides that projects are supposed to be delivered on budget and on time in order to achieve the desired goals and objectives.

---

Audit observed that in the sample of 371 projects, 342 projects with budgets totalling to UGX.39Tn had gone past their planned exit periods that date as far back as the FY2010/11, with some projects having been extended for more than 12 years. The audit noted that the projects continued to receive Development Committee approval for a continued stay on the PIP. It was noted that only 40% of the projects in the PIP were still within their expected time period.

As a result, this has caused delays in the completion of key projects, cost overruns and high commitment fees on foreign debt on account of low Absorption and failure to complete projects on time. It should also be noted that the effectiveness of some projects dwindles as time goes by.

The PS/ST was advised to critically review the justification for maintaining certain projects within the Country's Public Investment Plan.

3.6.5.  
Un recovered Advances; UGX.2,819,193,074

MoFPED introduced a policy to advance funds to entities before actual collection of Appropriation in Aid on the condition that these funds will be recovered after collection. The policy failed in the FY2018/19 and 2019/20 due to failure to recover funds fully.

During the financial year 2018/19, entities were advanced Appropriation in Aid, of which UGX.22.16Bn remained outstanding as at year-end. During the year 19/20, UGX.21.31Bn was recovered, leaving UGX.849 million outstanding.

It was also noted that during the financial year 2020/21, a total of UGX.116.9Bn was again advanced in disregard of what had happened earlier to various Local Governments. Out of the funds advanced, UGX.114.07Bn was recovered, leaving UGX.2.81Bn outstanding.

3.6.6.  
Absence of a monitoring and evaluation framework for impact assessment for tax exemptions

The Government of Uganda has offered many beneficiaries' tax benefits, including tax holidays, waivers for tax payments, and refunding of various taxes as stipulated in various agreements and memorandum of understanding. The benefits are granted based on intended objectives that include promotion of economic growth, increasing employment, facilitation for extension of social services by Non-Government Organisations, among others.

It was, however, noted that there is no mechanism in place for evaluating and or assessing the impact of the benefits granted. Analysis revealed that a number of beneficiaries have since had their benefit period expired without any follow up.

In the absence of a monitoring framework, Government is not in a position to assess the impact of the tax benefits granted to the various beneficiaries.

The Accounting Officer was advised to review the tax exemption Policy and set up a monitoring mechanism to follow up all tax incentive beneficiaries.

3.7. ENERGY SECTOR

3.7.1.  
Capitalization of Uganda National Oil Company and its Subsidiary Companies

Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) is charged with a mandate of representing Government of Uganda’s Commercial interests in Oil and Gas Sector. The Company is strategically positioned to participate in the down-stream, middle-stream and the up- stream of the oil and gas value chain, thereby engaging in the exploration, production and commercialization activities. The Company is anticipated to fully participate in the exploration and production in the Albertine Graben; the oil refinery and the oil pipeline. As a result, UNOC has registered two flag ship Subsidiary Companies to champion its commercial interests. These include; the Uganda Refinery Holding Company for the refinery business, and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline Company to lead in the pipeline business.

I noted that despite the significant initial investment requirements by UNOC and its subsidiary companies, the government has not fully capitalized the companies to enable their full participation in the sector. The companies are consistently facing funding constraints. For the period under review, I noted that out of the Budget of UGX.76.38Bn for UNOC, only UGX.34.4Bn was availed, resulting in a funding gap of UGX41.98Bn, which is 54.96% of the budget.

After the Final Investment Decision for the Upstream and EACOP Project, which is envisaged to be undertaken in February 2022, there will be a rapid increase of oil and gas activities which will cause an exponential growth in the financing needs of the Companies.  
UNOC has proposed a capitalization plan to MOFPED in its annual work programme and budget for the FY 2021/22 of UGX.914.18Bn comprising Capital expenditure (UGX.304.08Bn) and Operating expenditure (UGX.129.10Bn).

The Accounting Officer explained that he was engaging MOFPED and other stakeholders to secure finances to that magnitude, and a plan has been agreed with government on a phased approach towards capitalizing UNOC and its subsidiary companies.

I advised the Accounting Officer to fast-track their discussions with MoFPED to ensure adequate capitalization of the companies to enable government commercial participation in the strategic oil and gas sector.

3.7.2.  
Implementation of the Electricity Connection Policy(ECP)

The Government of Uganda established the Electricity Connections Policy (ECP), 2018 which is expected to run from 2018 to 2027. The primary objective of the policy is to increase electricity access, and provide cleaner energy to Ugandans. The policy aims at achieving the 26% rural access target by 2022, 30% national coverage target by 2020 and accelerating access after 2020 in order to achieve 60% access rate by the year 2027.

I noted from the review of the Connections Department work plans and progress reports for the year under review that out of the 97,000 annual planned connections, only 3,683 (3.7%) connections were undertaken. The dismal performance may frustrate the Government’s initiatives under the Policy and NDP III of increasing electricity access to the population to 60% by 2027.

---

I further noted that the ECP was facing challenges in delayed procurement of connection materials, under funding of compensations for the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), vandalism of the distribution network, among others.

The Accounting Officer explained that the funding for the Connection Policy got exhausted and the Policy was first suspended by Government. However, it resumed in March 2021 to facilitate connections by utilizing materials procured with funding from African Development Bank (ADB). He further explained, that Rural Electrification Program (REP) had secured approval from AFD to utilize the grant for connections intended to benefit 45,000 customers under the result-based implementation arrangement with the expected implementation to start by March 2022, and the connection materials are expected under the TBEA/Exim Bank contract which will benefit over 172,000 customers by June 2022.

I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the relevant stakeholders such as MoFPED and MEMD, to devise Sustainable funding strategies and ensure that implementation of the ECP is fast tracked for the achievement of policy objectives and service delivery.

3.7.3.  
Vandalism and Theft of UETCL Grid Assets

Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UECTCL is charged with bulk evacuation of power using High Voltage (220Kv and 132Kv). The Company majorly uses steel Towers for the construction of the Transmission Lines. During the year it incurred UGX.0.5Bn in purchase of Galvanized Angle bars to replace vandalized tower members. Further analysis revealed that the Company incurred UGX 1.56Bn in replacement costs on assorted transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021.

The Accounting Officer explained that this was a nationwide vice that has been brought to the attention of Cabinet and Security Agencies. In addition, Management installed a pilot security system on transmission lines, however the system was itself vandalized. Nevertheless, management continues to engage security agencies and also community policing to protect UETCL installations.

Vandalism impedes continuity and reliability of electricity supply to the country and strains company resources used to replace vandalized items and associated works. In addition, energy not transmitted due to infrastructure breakdown translates into loss in revenue to the company.

I advised the Accounting Officer to continue engaging the MoFPED and MEMD in order to obtain funding for Implementation of Key Projects and follow up with the relevant stakeholders to fast-track amendment of the relevant legislation and promotion of Joint Ventures and negotiation of Commercial Partnerships.

3.7.4.  
Deemed Energy Purchases: UGX.87.7 Billion and Power Evacuation Losses UGX.15.29 Billion

Deemed energy refers to the electric power that is available for dispatch by an Independent Power Producer (IPP), but due to; non-existent or a weak grid infrastructure, and/ or insufficient demand, the power is not dispatched. This effectively transfers the market risk from the investors to Government, especially when the Power Purchase Agreement states so.

---

According to several Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and other implementation agreements signed between the IPPs, GOU, and UETCL; GOU committed to construct power evacuation infrastructure from the IPP’s generation facilities to the distribution network upon commencement of generation and dispatch of power by IPPs. The failure to dispatch generated power constitutes deemed energy, and UETCL shall make payments to IPPs for such energy generated and not dispatched in accordance with the power purchase agreement.

I noted that UETCL continues to pay significant amounts relating to deemed energy purchases. As a result, deemed energy costs of UGX.87.7 billion in regard to thirteen (13) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), save for one Hydro Power Plant (HPP), were financed through the electricity tariff system, hence negatively impacting on the electricity price to the final consumer.

Similarly, I noted that UEDCL incurred an amount UGX.15.20Bn from power evacuation losses payable to UETCL for bulk power purchases. The amount is due to power evacuation losses stemming from absence of transmission lines to evacuate electricity from PA Technical, Siti 1 and Arpe Power Plants which resulted into wheeling power over a lower capacity and weaker distribution lines operated by UEDCL. These are significant losses for which the Company did not generate economic value. Payment of this amount would significantly affect the Company’s cash flows.

I advised the Accounting Officer to continue engaging the Regulator and other sector players to address the infrastructural constraints in the transmission network to ensure efficient evacuation of generated power.

3.7.5.  
Delayed Commissioning of Karuma HPP

According to the 4th Quarter Progress Report, I noted that the completion date for Karuma Dam was further extended to 15th June 2022, resulting in a delay of 3 years and 6 months from the initial planned completion date due to unfinished works such as the spillway rehabilitation and other minor defects.

I noted that the completion of land acquisition process or the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the 132kV Karuma-Lira Transmission Line and Karuma Dam Reservoir by UTECL and MEMD, respectively, remain outstanding. These when not completed will affect the commissioning of the Karuma Dam and is a breach of the employer’s obligations under the EPC Contract with significant risk to the overall project completion.

The delays in Project completion are likely to result in increased supervision costs, by the supervising consultant, and increased commitment fees payable on undrawn balances of the loan, of which GoU had already paid commitment fees amounting to UGX.2.9Bn as at 30th June 2021. It also reduces the period between commissioning, commercialization and payback which may have implications on the electricity tariff structure.

I further noted Key Non-conformities by the EPC Contractor which included; 11kV switchgears installation, Units 1 to 6 ring gate leakage oil sump control box, severe damages on the various 400kV cables, damaged conic sealing surfaces, repair of the oil water separator unit, prolonged spillway operation, Outgoing Line Yard – cracks in the Control Building and absence of a Floating Boom.

---

There is a risk that the non-conformities will result into damages, malfunction of equipment, unreliable plant components, and significant impact on working life duration and high operation and maintenance costs, as well as, negative environmental impact. This is likely to further affect the timely and successful commissioning of the Karuma Dam.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the rectification of pending works under the Karuma Dam is expedited to enable project completion and commissioning without further delay.

3.7.6.  
Bottlenecks in the Compensation of Project Affected Persons(PAPs) under Transmission Line Projects

The Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL) is mandated to augment government’s efforts of increasing electricity coverage and expanding the national power transmission line network. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Seven (7) and Nine (9) both aim at increased electricity access by 2030.The electricity transmission sector has been affected by delayed construction and energizing of transmission lines. The delay has contributed to the low electricity consumption rates in the country of 215 KWh per capita per year, which is below the Sub-Saharan Africa’s average of 552Kwh per capita per year. The delayed construction has further more resulted into low uptake of borrowed funds, leading to increased costs, such as commitment fees paid.

The delays in undertaking the construction of the transmission lines have been majorly attributed to inadequacies in the compensation process of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), thus leading to challenges faced in “Acquisition of the Right of Way” (ROW). This has in turn led to delayed implementation of a number of projects in the Energy Sector. A review of the compensation process under UETCL revealed the following irregularities;

i)  
The budgeting, disbursement, and absorption of compensation funds were not properly managed which resulted into over budgeting to the tune of UGX.111.3Bn on GERP and Mputa projects.

ii)  
The valuation process was marred with a number of irregularities, which included the use of un-updated district compensation rates; and unverified legal interests in the land; which resulted into unnecessary revaluations and ligation.

iii)  
About 56% of the PAPs for GERP and Mputa projects were not properly identified, and this resulted into a mismatch between the number of PAPs appearing on the Payment files, Survey reports and Valuation Reports.

iv)  
Of the released compensation amount of UGX.21.5Bn for both GERP and Mputa Projects, only UGX.5.86Bn was paid to PAPs, thus resulting into unspent funds to the tune of UGX.15.64Bn. This mostly affected the GERP Project which alone had UGX.13.17Bn not utilized, while Mputa had only UGX.1.66Bn.

v)  
There were significant delays in compensation of PAPs. 1,109 PAPs (52.2%) for Mputa and 821 (35%) for the GERP Transmission Line remained unpaid by the time of concluding the audit (November, 2021). Relatedly, Compensations in kind also delayed whereby out of 149 PAPs identified, only 93 were resettled, leaving 56 PAPs not resettled.

---

vi) There were inadequacies in the construction of the resettlement houses which included; irregular payments to contractors, delayed progress of works, discrepancies in drawing specifications and BOQs, poor materials used for construction, and a number of defects which were not rectified.

Timely compensations of project affected persons (PAPs) and acquisition of the right of way for electricity transmission lines would enable increased access to electricity by the citizens as envisaged in the sustainable development goals; 7 and 9. This would have a multiplier effect on industrialization which is critical for creation of employment and ultimately poverty reduction in the country.

I advised management to streamline its RAP processes, including proper identification of PAPs, clear valuation processes, proper budgeting and release of funds, timely submission of PAP documentation and proper supervision of RAP activities.

3.8.  
GENDER AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR

3.8.1. Labour Externalization Inadequacies

Labour externalization is a process whereby government undertakes to regulate the export of labour to foreign countries. This role is under the mandate of the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD). This activity involves the signing of Bi-lateral Migrant Agreements (BLMA) with destination countries. I noted that the country has only 3 BLMAs with destination countries namely; Saudi Arabia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. However, a review of the ministry records indicated that the country was exporting labour to more than 3 countries, such as; Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, among others.

I noted that the Ministry had no mechanism in place to monitor the implementation of the BLMAs. Furthermore, pre-externalization checks on the working conditions, safety and health perspectives of the importing labour organizations had not been undertaken. I observed that 246 female migrant workers returned between June and December 2019 without completing their contract period of two years due to human abuse related challenges, according to the Uganda Association of External Recruitment Agencies reception Centre report on Returnee Migrant workers.

Furthermore, 548 external labour cases were registered, out of which, 48 (9%) cases remained unresolved at year end.

Accordingly, the gender equality, labour and human rights of over 103,935 Ugandan workers who have migrated to various countries to provide labour, from July 2016 to June 2021, may not be guaranteed without duly signed BLMAs.

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the finalization of bilateral migrant agreements with all the destination countries as this would provide clear international protocols for protection of migrant workers. In addition, the Ministry should liaise with Ugandan Missions in the destination countries and register all the Ugandan migrants for ease of follow up.

3.8.2.  
Implementation of the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme

The Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) is an initiative of the Government for empowering women to improve their income levels and their contribution to economic development; by improving their access to financial services and equipping them with skills for enterprise growth, value addition and marketing of their products and services. The Programme has disbursed UGX.107 billion to 11,256 women groups, covering approximately 135,000 women, over the five-year period from financial year 2015/16 to 2019/20.

I carried out a Value for Money audit to assess the extent to which the Programme achieved its intended objectives, and noted a number of key improvement areas as follows;

i)  
I noted that only 4,185 women had benefited from the Programme under the capacity and skills development component, which translates into 42% of the desired target (10,000 women) according to the UWEP Programme document.

ii)  
There were delays in disbursement of funds to the women groups. In some cases, the delays were more than 12 months from time of approval of the applications to receipt of the funds which affected the performance and success of enterprises, specifically those in the agricultural sector, which depend on the rainy seasons for planting.

iii)  
Despite the UGX.16Bn sitting on the recovery account with Bank of Uganda from the loan repayments over the five years, only UGX.963 million (6%) of the amount had been revolved. This denied the qualifying women groups timely access to funds, which were otherwise available for disbursement.

iv) The Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development through the UWEP Technical Support Unit did not effectively plan and coordinate implementation of the objectives of facilitating women to access markets for their product, as well as promoting access to appropriate technologies which were not allocated funds in the budgets for the entire 5-year period. Consequently, these objectives were not fully achieved.

v) There was underfunding of monitoring and supervision activities at the local government level which affected the frequency of monitoring of beneficiary women groups. The programme gaps at enterprise level could not be adequately identified and corrected on time. At the National level, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) undertook only 13 (43%) of the planned 30 monitoring and supervision visits to the regions throughout the five-year period. This resulted in delayed identification of performance gaps and timely remedial actions.

I advised the Accounting Officer, prioritize the capacity and skills development component of the Programme and ensure women groups are given funds after attaining the requisite skills in management of the approved enterprises. In addition, the Ministry and Local Authorities should iron out all the bottlenecks in the application approval process to ensure timely revolving of the funds to women groups.

3.9. LAND SECTOR  
3.9.1. Management of Government Land Matters

The Uganda Land Commission is mandated to manage public land acquired by government both abroad and locally. I noted that the Commission does not have an inventory for all government land and properties that are either occupied by tenants, vacant, acquired under compensation (but not yet re-distributed to the bona fide occupants), or acquired and owned by other government institutions and missions abroad. This inadequacy has contributed to government losing land to fraudsters, squatters and also inadequate revenue collections from the untimely collection of the property premiums and leases.

I further noted an increase of UGX. 118.Bn (81.5%) in land compensation payables during the year, of which UGX 105.5Bn related to new compensations for land, while UGX.12.5Bn related to revaluations of land that had been previously fully compensated or had an outstanding payment. Furthermore, UGX.8.93Bn (15%) was paid to eight (8) persons out of the eight four (84) ranchers who had not been paid in the previous years. The delay to pay other ranch claimants may result into litigation and court awards that would further increase the domestic arrears. As at 30th June, 2021, the outstanding claim from ranchers was UGX.61.5Bn, and compensations to other claimants stood at UGX.188.0Bn, thus bringing total outstanding compensations in the Ministry of Lands alone to UGX.249.5Bn.  
Similarly, the current landlord claims under the Uganda Land Fund, at the Uganda Land Commission, stand at UGX 194.7Bn. These also increased by UGX.7.2Bn during the current year. However, this amount is not supported by complete and appropriate documentation. The claims have been outstanding for a while due to the limited budget allocation to the Commission and the delay to fully operationalize the Land Fund which has remained operating as a budget support line in the Commission’s appropriated budget.

I advised government to fully operationalize the Land Fund under the Commission and consider decentralizing all government land compensation payment claims to the Fund for proper management of government compensation processes, including mobilization of funds.

3.10. EDUCATION SECTOR  
3.10.1. Management of Bilateral Scholarships

Section 42(1) of the Higher Education Students Financing Act provides that all scholarships offered by the Government of Uganda (GOU), including bilateral scholarships, existing immediately before the commencement of this Act shall vest in the Board.

Subsection (2) further provides that the central scholarship committee of the Ministry of education and Sports existing immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to exist on such a date as the Minister may by Statutory Instrument publish in the gazette.

---

Over the years, Uganda has received scholarships through various schemes from several Countries. The various types of awards include offers through bilateral cooperation, offers through multilateral cooperation and direct offers to individuals through Embassies of awarding Governments, Institutions and Agencies.

Scholarships awarded to Ugandans through Embassies of awarding Government are in most cases received on an annual basis, most of them routed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The major and regular donors are; United Kingdom, India, Egypt, China, Cuba, Turkey, Algeria, New Zealand and Hungary, among others.

A review was undertaken with the objective of establishing the effectiveness in management of Bi-lateral scholarships, identifying the challenges and providing recommendations for improvement. During the analysis, a number of aspects were considered including; the extent of awareness of the scholarship programmes by Ugandans, absorption of Bilateral Scholarships, and the transparency and effectiveness of the award process. The following matters anomalies were identified;

- Management of scholarships at the Ministry of Education and Sports is not supported by a Scholarship Policy, thus the country lacks policy direction in regard to sourcing, accepting, allocation and monitoring of scholarships.

- The Ministry of Education and Sports still holds the mandate of managing Government scholarships contrary to Section 42(1) of the Higher Education Students Financing Act which revoked the Committee’s mandate.

- Information on Scholarship offered at the different Missions and other Government organizations was not readily available at the Secretariat.

- Low uptake of scholarships was noted whereby out of a total of 280 scholarships offered to government in the previous three years, only 162 were filled resulting into an under absorption of 118 (42%) scholarships.

The above outlined weaknesses have resulted into the process of accessing information on scholarships not being properly streamlined and consequently leading to low utilization/absorption of the scholarships available to the Country.

I advised the Ministry of Education and Sports to ensure that the administration of scholarships in the country is streamlined for efficient and effective management.

3.10.2. Management of Research Grants by Public Universities in Uganda

Owing to the different challenges faced by public Universities in the management of research grants I undertook a value for money audit and independently assessed the management of research grants by Public Universities in 4 out of the 9 Public Universities in Uganda, these included; Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), Kyambogo University and Busitema University. I noted the following;

i)  
There is no framework to ensure collective planning, coordination and follow-up of research efforts for the different Public Universities to ensure equitable allocation of resources, efficient utilization of academic staff, and that research results contribute to National development.

---

ii)  
I noted that key research and grant management policies/guidelines were missing at a number of Universities to guide on the efficient and effective management of research activities. Furthermore, the country lacks national regulations and guidelines for research and innovation activities including; sourcing of external grants, development and uptake of technologies and, management and commercialization of intellectual properties.

iii)  
I noted inadequate administration structures for management of university grants, for example, out of the 4 Universities, only MUST had a grants office with dedicated staff to support grant activities. Busitema and Kyambogo universities did not have grants administrators at college/faculty level, while at Makerere and Mbarara only the college of Health Sciences and the faculty of medicine, respectively, had grant administrators to undertake the tasks.

iv)  
I noted that the country does not have a clear research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy matters regarding research in the Country. Some Universities lacked research agenda. For example, Mbarara and Busitema Universities did not have an approved research agenda.

v) I noted that resource mobilization initiatives for public universities were inadequate. Out of the 4 universities, only MUK had a consolidated Research Innovation Fund (RIF) for research funds from government the other universities have not explored this initiative. All the universities have not raised any resources internally into a separate fund for research. This was attributed to government policy of remitting all internally generated revenue into the consolidated fund.

vi)  
I noted monitoring and evaluation of research projects was inadequate in all the four Universities. M&E was not carried out by the university management on external research grants for the period 2017/18-2019/20. I further noted that even where M&E was undertaken by donors, recommendations were not fully implemented by the Universities.

vii) I noted significant delays in completion of research projects. For example, 450 (88%) out of 512 Government funded Grants from MUK, Kyambogo and Busitema, were not completed in time during the period under review. Similarly, 218 (62.3%) out of 350 Donor funded Grants from the 4 universities were not completed in time.

I advised government through its various entities to consider establishing a National research agenda which should be supported by a comprehensive research management framework streamlined throughout the entities. In addition, Government should consider establishing a research fund at each public university in which both government and donor research funds could be collected and effectively managed.

3.11. WATER & ENVIRONMENT SECTOR

3.11.1.  
Afforestation and Restoration of Selected Central Forest Reserves (CFRS) by the National Forest Authority (NFA)

The National Forestry Authority (NFA) was established under section 52 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 (NFTPA) with an objective of managing the Central Forest reserves. The country’s forest cover reduced from 24% (4,933,271ha) in 1990 to 9% (1,956,664ha) in 2015, with a slight increase of up to 12.3% (2,025,192ha) in 2017. The forest cover loss over the years from 1990 to the last biomass study in 2017 was estimated at 58.9%. Similarly, the CFR forest cover under NFA’s jurisdiction alone dropped from 62.5% (791,240ha) of the NFA forest cover to 45.8% (579,257ha) in the same period. This trend was contrary to Sustainable Development Goal 15 which required governments to ensure the restoration of forests and increase forest cover in line with obligations under international agreements by 2020.

I carried a value for money audit to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place by the NFA towards the restoration and establishment of new plantations in the central forest reserves, between the period of 2016 and 2020, and noted the following;

i) Although management achieved 11,173ha (78%) of their planned outputs (14,277ha) for both restoration planting and establishment of new tree plantations, this only contributed a total of only 0.88% to the NFA forest cover (1,265,742ha) over the four-year period. This dismal performance was attributed to a number of inadequacies in the Planning; Budgeting; Land management; Monitoring and Inspections; and Collaboration management, resulting into the failure by NFA to meet its desired targets towards increasing the national forest cover.

ii) A number of stakeholders in the forest sector, with different projects across MDAs supporting forestry restoration activities, were not adequately coordinated under a single mandate. In addition, there are; inconsistencies in the national, sector and NFA strategic plans, there is a lack of specific outputs per stakeholder in the plan together with matching funding for the activities met to achieve the planned outputs. These inadequacies in coordination and planning at NFA, the Forest sector and national level have contributed to the limited National forest coverage of 12.3% and NFA forest cover of 45.8%.

iii) I that out of the expected 16 monitoring reports in the four-year period ending 30 th June, 2020, only 4 (25%) were prepared in the entire four-year period. In addition, NFA budgeted to receive UGX.320m for monitoring in the four years under review, but only UGX.91.8million (29%) was released, and the entity spent UGX 88.8million over the period on monitoring activity. Furthermore, there were limitations in discussing and implementing monitoring report recommendations, and as a result, there were instances in which management did not demarcate the area as recommended by the M&E report before restoring the forest. This led to destruction of the newly restored forests by encroachers.

I established that seventeen (17) MOUs were signed with different government agencies, out of the planned twenty (20), representing an 85% performance. Although these collaborations contributed to the restoration and establishment of new plantations, there were inadequacies in providing the planned quantity of seedlings. In addition, twenty (20) out twenty-eight (28) Collaborative Forest management (CFM) agreements were signed with forest edge communities.

---

I advised the Accounting Officer to improve on the Planning, Budgeting, Coordination and Collaborations, Monitoring aspects, and prioritization of fixed resources required in the restoration and establishment of forest cover in the country.

3.12. WORKS SECTOR

3.12.1.  
Uganda National Roads Authority

a)  
Loss of funds in interest on delayed payment of contractors

The Authority incurred wasteful expenditure to a tune of UGX.17Bn in form of interest and penalties due to delayed settlement of invoices from contractors. This was a loss to Government. The Accounting Officer explained that interest costs arise due to inadequate funding for the road development and maintenance projects that UNRA is managing. I advised the Accounting Officer to enhance the Authority cash flow management by rationalizing available resources, especially reduction of advances payments to settle outstanding claims and to improve the Authority’s budgeting process and liaison with relevant authorities such Parliament and Ministry of Finance for adequate financial resource allocation.

b)  
Delayed road projects and accumulation of commitment fees

By 30 th June 2021, 35 road projects under UNRA with a total contract value of USD.398,427,063.99 and UGX.149,739,813,845 had been delayed. These 35 projects were to be completed during the year were behind schedule as per their work programme still on-going by the close of the year. The delays which ranged from 64 days (about two months) to 1,072 days (about two months three years) days were majorly attributed to: inadequate mobilization by some contractors, abnormal rains, delayed acquisition of Right of Way and the effects of COVID-19 that resulted into nationwide lockdown. I computed commitment fees on only two projects (Busega-Mpigi- UGX.7,1140,345,245) and RSSPV (UGX.3,079,241,588) and observed an accumulation of total commitment fees amounting to UGX.10,219,586,833 in only one year alone.

The Accounting Officer explained that the delay to complete the projects was due to a number of factors that included; inadequate mobilization by some contractors, abnormal rains, delayed acquisition of Right of Way and the effects of COVID-19 that resulted into nationwide lockdown. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that projects are completed within the agreed timelines.

c)  
Delayed compensation for Project Affected Persons and Acquisition of Right of Way for Road Projects (Projects- Kampala Jinja Expressway, Hoima Wanseko)

I observed delays in compensation of Project Affected Persons and hence Acquisition of the Right of Way. The majority of Project Affected Persons are compensated beyond the stipulated six-month period after approval of the Valuation Reports by the Chief Government Valuer. For the KJE Project, the construction works are planned to commence in January 2022. However, 21% of the approved compensation amount worth UGX.92,571,144,970 has not yet been paid, with less than 6 months to the scheduled commencement date which is likely to impede timely handover of the project corridor and timely commencement of works. In addition, compensation for properties within volume 5 comprising Kasokoso area had not yet been assessed.

---

The Accounting Officer explained that a number of issues caused the delays for compensations, such as; lack of proper ownership documents, for example; sales agreements, letters of administration, ownership disputes especially for untitled interests like Kibanja or customary land, absentee landlords, and; rejection of compensation awards by PAPs that lead to review of the complaint to ascertain validity. I advised the Accounting Officer to consider using escrow accounts with district local governments for the absentee landlords and PAPs where funds may be deposited so as to aid fast land acquisition.

3.12.2.  
Ministry of Works and Transport

a) Failure to maintain district road equipment

The inspection of the Ministry’s Regional Mechanical Workshops during August and September 2021 revealed that 21 units of district road equipment which are key in opening and maintaining district roads were left unused in the workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair. The equipment included: thirteen (13) motor graders of different models; four (4) bulldozers; One (1) pickup; two (2) dump trucks, and one (1) wheel loader. This means that the districts that own the said equipment could not maintain their roads and deliver such critical service to the country as planned. In addition, the cost of repair may escalate as other parts also become faulty when the equipment is grounded for a long time.

The Accounting Officer explained that the amount budgeted and received to maintain road equipment represents 30% of the total funds required for equipment maintenance. I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the responsible authorities to obtain the necessary funding for the full maintenance of the equipment so that the equipment operates and serves the Districts.

b) Delayed acquisition of land for the Right of Way for the Standard Gauge Railway project (Ministry of Works and Transport)

The SGR project was to acquire 5,200 acres of land free of encumbrances at an estimated cost of UGX 534.6 bn for the Right of Way (ROW) for the construction of the Kampala – Malaba SGR route by October 2016. However, by September 2021 only 1,296 acres (25%) had been acquired at a cost of UGX 95.3 bn. Additionally, the project had not obtained titles for the acquired land. There are risks of subsequent compensation for the land already paid for and failure to acquire all the land needed for the full realization of the project.

The Accounting Officer explained that currently, land acquisition is one of the core activities of the project. He further explained that the releases however have been going down in comparison to the annual budgets. I advised the Accounting Officer to obtain and transfer land titles to Government for the land paid for and expedite the acquisition of all the land needed for the project.

3.12.3. Uganda Railways Corporation

a) Procurement, supply, delivery, training and commissioning of four (4) used locomotives

URC contracted M/S GRP Leasing Africa for the supply, delivery, training and commissioning of four (4) used locomotives under procurement reference; URC/SUPLS/2020-11/0001 at UGX.41,323,768,935. However, I noted that the bidder did not comply with some requirements within the bid document which were supposed to be the basis of evaluation. Despite the non-compliance, the bid was evaluated without following the evaluation criteria for Technical stage contrary to the regulations. Non-compliance with the evaluation criteria may have led to delivery of unsuitable locomotives at an inflated cost. Important to note was that the locomotives could not turn at the existing turning points in the country. Therefore, the Corporation will incur un-planned costs of providing turning points for the locomotives.

The Accounting Officer further explained that the limiting turning curvature for the 98 class locomotives is 26 degrees whereas the existing railway triangle had some sections with sharper curvature of less than 26 degrees presumably because the existing triangle design considered the existing locomotive fleet prior to purchase of the new locomotives with different design specifications to safely change direction at the triangle. The physical constraints of the triangle including 2 bridges over Nakivubo channel, high voltage electricity transmission line pylon and the Kampala Flyover Project Right of Way have limited any possible improvements in the triangle alignment to relax the limiting curvature. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that Evaluation Committees check for bids’ responsiveness to the criteria set in the bid documents and recommend only fully responsive bids for award of contracts.

b) Lack of Land titles - UGX 91,832,636,500

I noted that Uganda Railways Corporation land worth UGX.91,832,636,500 lacked land titles as evidence of URC’s rights to own and use the property. Management’s efforts to secure the land titles appear remote. Lack of land titles led to the Corporation’s land to have been heavily encroached upon and grabbed as was observed during field inspection.

The Accounting Officer explained that Management was pursuing the titling of land in various locations. I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the completion of Management interventions and processing of titles for all URC land.

3.12.4.  
Uganda Civil Aviation Authority

a) Delayed revision of the Financing Agreement for the Exim Bank loan for Upgrading and Expansion of the Entebbe International Airport (EIA) Phase I Project

UCAA entered into an agreement with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) on 8 th October 2014 for the upgrading and expansion of the EIA Phase I. To obtain funding for this project, the Government of Uganda (GoU) represented by Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) entered into a 20 years’ concessional loan agreement not exceeding Japanese Yuan One Billion, two hundred and sixty million (¥ 1,260,000,000), equivalent to USD Two Hundred Million ($200,000,000) with the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China on 31 st March 2015.

---

Subsequently, MoFPED entered into an on-lending agreement with the UCAA which transferred the following loan obligations to the Authority: -

a) Semi-annual loan repayment within 13 years after the grace period of 7 years at an interest rate of 2% p.a on the principal amount drawn for the actual number of days elapsed from a 360-day year.

b)  
Payment of a management fee on the aggregate amount of the facility equal to ¥ 3,150,000 (USD 500,000) in one lump sum within 30 days after the effective date of the agreement with EXIM Bank but not later than the first disbursement.

c) Semi-annual payment of commitment fees calculated at 0.25% per annum during the loan availability period.

Other terms of the agreements relating to the loan included:  
a) The Repayment Reserve account shall be used to maintain the minimum amount of balance as a debt service reserve required by the lender.

b) Banking of Revenue collections on Escrow Accounts, and ensuring that withdrawals are based on approvals of the lender.

c)  
Budgeting and Approval of Annual budgets by the lender for funds on Escrow Accounts.

d)  
Paying semi-annually to the lender a commitment fee calculated at the rate set forth in concessional loan agreement (which is 0.25%) on the undrawn and un-cancelled balance of the facility.

Because UCAA was not prepared to meet the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, several meetings were held with the MoFPED and the MoWT and a resolution was made to have a Ugandan team headed by Uganda’s Ambassador to China, to engage Exim bank for a renegotiation of the loan terms and conditions. At the time, the Exim Bank had halted payments to the Contractor.

The Accounting officer explained that as per the Attorney Generals guidance dated 5th November 2021, in his opinion none of the clauses in the agreement require amendment.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the relevant authorities on the clarity of the consequences of non-compliance with the terms and conditions that directly affect UCAA’s operations, and on the possibility of transferring the loan liability from UCAA’s books to MoFPED.

b) Ratio analysis and financial performance of Uganda Civil Aviation Authority  
The Authority made a loss for the year under review amounting to UGX 29,321,645,000. On review of the operating margin, I observed that the costs before considering interest and taxes exceeded revenue for the year. I also observed that due to the loss incurred, the Authority generated a negative return on assets of 5%. Further, the Authority could not cover interest accrued on its long-term loans in view of its earnings. Along with the lack of potential to cover loan interest, the Authority had a significant long term liabilities portfolio on its balance sheet, which majorly comprised of the loan from Exim of China to finance the upgrading and expansion of Entebbe International Airport.

---

The Authority’s loss and the ratios computed are an indication that Uganda Civil Aviation Authority did not perform well in terms of profitability and ability to sustain provision of services without further Government intervention for funding and Management strategies to improve revenue generation. The Accounting Officer explained that the performance results during the period were severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation that affected the airport operations of the Authority.

I advised the Accounting officer to ensure that strategies are devised to improve the revenue generating potential of the Authority, while putting in place cost cutting mechanisms. I also advised the Accounting Officer to engage Government on further financing including clearance of the debt held by Government agencies, to be able to cover the current operating costs as they devise strategies to improve the earning potential of the Authority.

3.13.1.  
Mulago National Referral Hospital

a)  
Status of key medical equipment

I carried out an assessment of key medical equipment in the hospital. The assessment focused on the functionality and availability of medical equipment in seven key hospital departments, that is; CSSD, radiology, nuclear medicine, ICU, Laundry, clinical laboratories and accidents and emergencies. I noted that some vital medical equipment was in poor working condition, while others were fully not functional and required replacement. The equipment included: autoclaves in the central sterile service department; patient monitors in the accident and emergency surgical unit; blood coagulation machine in the clinical laboratory unit; ICU beds in the intensive care unit, and CT machine in the Radiology department.

Management attributed the poor state of medical equipment in the Hospital to the limited funding provided under the capital development budget of the Hospitals. Absence of such essential medical equipment presents a daunting task for the medical workers in the effective execution of their duties. The efficiency of the medical workers is compromised.

I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the MoFPED and development partners to ensure that the funding gaps are covered to have the essential medical equipment provided to the hospital units.

b)  
Delayed Construction of 150 housing units

I observed delays in the construction 150 housing units at Mulago Hospital. The contract was awarded on 20 th June 2020 at UGX.30,228,600,856 for a duration of thirty-six (36) months. One year and half down the road, the contractor had not yet completed the foundation of the first block out of the three blocks expected.

---

The Accounting Officer indicated that the UGX. 4bn cap on the hospital capital expenditure budget creates challenges in undertaking high value capital projects since the absence of funding leads to delays in achievement of project milestones leading to project cost overruns. The Accounting Officer further explained that they have received funds in this Financial Year Budget to pay the contractor and it is expected that by the end of June 2022, the progress of construction shall be at a desirable level.

I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with contractor to ensure that the construction of the above staff houses is expedited.

3.13.2. National Drug Authority  
a) Delayed Construction of the Laboratory Tower

NDA is undertaking a Laboratory Tower Construction project at a total contract sum of UGX. 35,849,057,474. The start for the works was 11 th October 2019 and the original completion date was 11 th October 2021. The completion was revised to 07 th March 2022 because of delays. By the time of inspection, UGX 11,847,043,442 had been paid to the contractors. The implementation of the contract was not sufficiently managed leading to delayed works.

I also noted that changes were made to the original building plans to cater for the adjustments to the outdoor and building basement parking and though the Contract Management Team and the Authority (NDA) had approved the adjustments and works had commenced by the time of audit in August 2021, the amended building plans had not yet been approved by the Metropolitan Physical Planning Authority. Implementation of unapproved building plans poses a risk of loss of the NDA funds in case the responsible Authority (Metropolitan Authority /KCCA) rejects the plans and directs demolition of the works.

The Accounting Officer explained that the delays in the completion of works were due to the COVID-19 lockdown that took two phases in 2020 and 2021 which interrupted staff movement, manufacturing of inputs globally and transportation. The Accounting Officer also explained that the consultant submitted the revised drawings on 3rd August 2020 and no response had come through despite numerous follow-ups including that of 15th April 2021. Management promised to continue reminding KCCA to approve the submitted adjusted plans.

I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the contractors to scale up project works to ensure that the project is completed within reasonable timelines. I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the Physical Planning Authority/KCCA to ensure that the building plans are approved as soon as possible.

3.14. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION SECTOR

3.14.1.  
Closure of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation

The GoU established the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation in 2016, and it started its operations in 2017/2018 as Vote 023, with a mandate to oversee the overall contribution of the Science Technology and Innovation Sector towards attaining key objectives focused on mainstreaming Science, Technology, and Innovation in the development process of Uganda.

---

At the time of the transfer, the Ministry had the following subventions and independent projects in pursuit of its objectives;

i)  
Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST);  
ii)  
The Presidential Initiative on Banana Industrial Development (PIBID); and  
iii) Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC).  
iv)  
Uganda Industrial Research Institute (Vote 110), an agency under the ST&I Sector and self-accounting.  
v)  
The commercialisation of sericulture Technologies and Innovations(TRIDI)  
vi) Presidential Scientific initiative on Epidemics (PRESIDE) is an umbrella organisation for multiple scientific research organisations.

The Ministry was later abolished effective 1st July 2021, and its operations were transferred to the President's Office. The Ministry's closure may slow down the developments in the above entities during re-organisation.

I noted that there were also no transition plans for the merger and continuity of operations of the subventions. Lack of transition arrangements could delay research projects, loss of assets and critical human resources.

3.14.2.  
Un-deployed Staff upon the abolition of the Ministry

The Ministry had a structure with a total staff establishment of 154 positions, of which 136 positions had been filled and had a recruitment plan for another fifteen (15) staff of different cadres.

As a result of the closure of the Ministry, the staff were rendered redundant and had not received their emoluments by the end of November 2021. In addition, 48 common cadre staff had been transferred back to the Ministry of Public Service, as the technical and support staff employed by the Ministry await their fate.

I noted that some staff were living under uncertainty, which may lead to redundancy escalation and high costs to the Government.

Management explained that the Ministry of Public Service is reviewing the structure, and once it is approved, a validation exercise will be undertaken to determine those who fit in. Those that will not be absorbed will be handled in line with the public service standing orders.

3.14.3.  
Progress on the COVID-19 Vaccine, Diagnostics and Treatment Projects

The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) was appropriated supplementary funding of UGX.31.033Bn, which was meant to support 23 selected projects of scientists and innovators engaged in CoVID-I9 scientific research, including the procurement of specialised machinery and equipment, development of vaccines, drug diagnostics and other operational costs. The funds were divided into the purchase of Equipment (UGX.15.787Bn) and Operational Costs (UGX.15.787Bn).

As of 30th June 2021, the Ministry had received 86.5% of the Operational funds and 100% of the Equipment Funds.

---

Of the 23 projects, five were for Diagnostics, four for the development of Vaccines, nine for the development of treatments, and five for material support to existing projects.  
Of the 23 projects initially selected and funded, 19 progressed while others stalled. Their progress was slowed down by the merger of the Ministry without transition plans and subsequent delays in funding.

These delays affect the overall intention of the emergency initiative of averting the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the population.

3.15. TRADE SECTOR

3.15.1.  
Under Absorption of funds by UDC

UDC received UGX 263.47Bn, from the Government of Uganda, of which only UGX 119.29Bn, (45.3%), was spent by the entity during the year resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 144.18Bn, (46%)

Out of the total funds received, UGX.126.2Bn was for Covid-19related interventions, and only UGX.55.9Bn (44.3%) was spent.

This may be partly attributed to the release of funds before completion of feasibility studies, the release of funds tagged to specific projects in disregard of UDC project appraisals and the un-timely release of funds, among others.

Under-absorption undermines the intention of Government funding for import substitution and export promotion strategies spearheaded by the Corporation and averting the effects of Covid-19.

3.15.2.  
Extent of Implementation of Planned Development Projects by UDC:

I noted that out of the 17 development project activities planned to be implemented over the year, 15 were funded under the Covid-19 supplementary budget. Two development projects, namely: Soroti Fruit Factory and Feasibility studies & Business Plans, were funded under the normal budget.

A review of the extent of implementation revealed that;

- Only (3) three development projects were fully implemented, i.e., shareholder's loan to Atiak Sugar Factory; Acquisition of shares in Mabale Tea Factory; and Acquisition of shares in Bukoona Agro Processors Limited.
- Five (5) development projects were partially implemented.
- Eleven (11) projects were not implemented at all.

This was attributed to the conditional release of funds tied to specified development projects and inadequate institutional capacity to appraise and implement investment projects.

Under-absorption undermines government effort in attaining its goals.

---

3.15.3.  
UNBS Inadequate Capacity in Testing and Enforcing Commodity Standards

Section 3(1) of the UNBS Act spells out the functions of the Bureau which, among others, include providing for the testing of locally manufactured or imported commodities with a view to determining whether the commodities conform to the standard specification as well as making arrangements or provide facilities for the examination, testing or analysis of commodities and any material or substance from which or with which and how they may be manufactured, produced, processed or treated. However, I noted;

- UNBS released 633 consignments due to the absence of standards to test these commodities for conformity.

- The Bureau also released 366 consignments without testing product standards due to lack of capacity, which may lead to sub-standard products on the market.

- The Bureau had staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. This was attributed to understaffing at the Bureau.

Although management explained that it had since developed the capacity to test the majority of commodities but it lacked some product standards.

3.16. TOURISM SECTOR

3.16.1.  
Decreasing Tourism Revenue due to Covid-19

Over the last two years, the tourism sector has been greatly hit by the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that has greatly affected all sectors of the economy, including the tourism sector.

I observed a significant fall in tourism revenue collections for all of the entities in the Sector whose revenue is entirely dependent on tourism. This was attributed to the countrywide restrictions on the movement of persons, including tourists, due to the Covid-19 lockdown. As a result, tourist visitor numbers reduced from 255,711 to 103,812 (40.6%)

The reduction in revenue collection has been significant and has directly affected the implementation of the planned activities across the Sector.

3.16.2.  
Invasive species removal in the Wildlife Conservation Areas in Uganda

I noted that most of the Protected Areas in Uganda are currently undergoing ecosystem changes as rangeland infestation by invasive and exotic plant species limits the grazing land. These plant species include; Dichrostachys cinerea, Lantana camara, Parthenium hysterophorus, Opuntia vulgaris, Imperata cylindrica, Maeruade cumbens, Caesalepina decaputala, Acacia hockii, Tecoma Stan, Senna siamea and Thevetia peruviana.

---

During my inspection of Queen Elizabeth, Lake Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks, I noted that these plant species continue to cover large expanses of grazing land despite the Uganda Wildlife Authority's effort to eliminate them. This is reducing the populations of specific grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda kobs.

This is attributed to climate change and inadequate funding to remove invasive species from the national parks.

3.16.3.  
Merger of entities within the Sector

On 22nd February 2021, Cabinet under minute No. 43 (CT 2021), a decision to merge Uganda Wildlife Authority with Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre was undertaken. However, there were no transitional arrangements and plans to facilitate a smooth merger by the time of the audit.

Delays in mergers create uncertainties among staff, reduce sector performance and subsequently lead to misappropriation of entity assets by disgruntled staff.

3.17.  
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE AUDIT OF LOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE PERIOD 2019/2020

I undertook an audit of a total of 2,048 Lower Local Governments (Sub-counties, Town Councils and Divisions), covering two financial years 2018/2019 (762 LLGs) and 2019/2020 (1,286 LLGs).  
I noted the following cross cutting issues;

3.17.1. Under staffing

I noted that 217 LLGs in FY 2018/2019 and 175 in FY 2019/2020 had significant staffing gaps averaging 48% and 60% shortages respectively. Details are in the table 26 below.

Table 26: Understaffing in Lower Local Government

| Financial Year | Approved | Filled up | Shortage | Percentage shortage |  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
|| positions |<|<|<|  
| 2018/2019 | 3,847 | 2,008 | 1,842 | 48% |  
| 2019/2020 6,797 2,713 3,823 60% |<|<|<|<|  


Source: OAG analysis

Understaffing overstretches the available staff beyond their capacity, creates jobrelated stress to the fewer staff and negatively affects the level of public service delivery to the community.

The Accounting Officers explained that staffing at LLG level is a responsibility of the respective Districts and Municipal Councils.

I advised the Accounting Officers to follow up on the matter with the relevant authorities and ensure that most of the vacancies are filled.

---

3.17.2.  
Budget implementation in sample LLGs for FY 2018/2019 and 2019/2020

I sampled 627 LLGs for FY 2018/19 and 250 LLGs for FY 2019/20 to assess the implementation of the budget and noted the following significant audit findings:

3.17.2.1. Performance of Central Government Grants

The LLGs sampled budgeted to receive UGX.146,160,919,043 for FY 2018/2019 and 2019/2010 (revised) as Central Government Grants). However, UGX.134,095,135,622(92%) was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.12,065,783,421(8%) majorly attributed to budget cuts as shown in the table below.

This affected service delivery in Lower Local Governments Table 27: Performance of Central Government Grant

Source: Financial Statements

I advised the Accounting Officer to always engage the PS/ST through their respective higher local governments to ensure that all revenue is availed to the entity as planned.

3.17.2.2. Local Revenue Performance

The LLGs sampled had approved budgeted total local revenue for the 2 financial years amounting to UGX.91,399,324,016 (revised) out of which UGX.74,615,525,633(82%) was collected resulting into a shortfall of UGX.16,783,798,383(18%), as shown in the table below:

Table 28: Performance of Local Revenue

| Financial Year | Revised Budget | Actual Receipts | Variance | Percentage |  
|---|---|---|---|---|

Source: OAG analysis

The Accounting Officers mainly attributed the underperformance of local revenue in the financial year 2019/2020 to the Covid19 lock down which affected several of their major sources of local revenue.

I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that local revenue is collected as budgeted.

---

3.17.3.  
Quality of Financial Statements

In my previous year’s reports, I noted that there was still a problem with the presentation of financial statements in the Lower Local Governments. In the financial years under review, I noted that there was an improvement in the quality of financial statements with only 37 (6%) LLGs out of 627 and 22 (9%) out of 250 LLGs in financial years 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 respectively having qualified audit opinions.

I however noted the following matters; UGX 202, 282,811 was improperly accounted for in FY 2018/2019 and UGX 80,259,257 remained Un accounted for in FY 2019/2020.

The most common shortcomings were; Inconsistences in the amounts in the financial statement, Errors in Financial Statements, Incomplete financial statements and notes, wrong presentation of figures in financial statement, failure to prepare financial statements and unsupported figures in the financial statements.

Preparation of financial statements is a stewardship role in which accountability for application of resources entrusted to Accounting Officers is reported to the stakeholders. Failure to present financial statements properly impairs interpretation and analysis of entity performances.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to staff changes that were made in the middle of the financial year, difficulty in acquiring books of accounts from district stores and lack of training. I advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with responsible authorities to ensure that the staffing gaps are addressed and the necessary trainings undertaken.

3.17.4.  
Land Management in Local Governments

I noted that 331 (53%) Lower Local Governments out of the 627 in FY 2018/19 and 188 (75%) Lower Local Governments out of 250 in FY 2019/20 sampled respectively had land management challenges such as:

- 41 LLGs in FY 2018/19 and 24 LLGs in FY 2019/20 respectively lacked land titles, including where their headquarters are located.
- 41 LLGs in FY 2018/19 and 24 LLGs in FY 2019/20 respectively lacked Area Lands Committees or the committees were non-functional.
- In the circumstances, there is risk of persons trespassing, disputes and litigation.

Majority of Accounting Officers explained that it was the responsibility of the Districts or Municipal Councils to obtain these land titles. A number of other Accounting Officers cited insufficient funding as a cause for failure to have fully functional land committees

Government should consider taking deliberate steps to fund the survey and titling of all government land at the Local Governments. I also advised the Accounting Officers to constitute the Area land Committees.

---

3.17.5.  
Lack of Urban Physical Planning Committees

I noted that 32 Town Councils in the two financial years had no Urban Physical Planning Committees in place or the Committees were not fully functional.

Consequently, physical developments undertaken within the physical planning areas may not have been well determined and managed by the respective LLGs. This was mainly attributed to lack of sufficient funds to operationalize the physical planning committees.

I advised Government to engage the relevant stakeholders to nominate members and ensure that the committees are fully instituted and are functional.

PART 4: INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, VALUE FOR MONEY AND SPECIAL AUDITS

During the financial year 2020/2021, I undertook three Information Systems audits, three Engineering audits covering 90 projects, eight Value for money audits. In addition, I undertook special and forensic audits which are reported on separately.

Below is a summary of the key findings I noted in each category, the details of which are included in individual reports issued separately.

**4.0.**  
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ENGINEERING AUDITS

**4.1.** Value for Money Audit and Assessment of Urban Infrastructure projects implemented by 22 Municipal Councils under the USMID-AF Program for projects started in the Financial year 2018/2019

For the financial year 2020/21 a total of 14 infrastructure projects procured in 2018/2019 under the World Bank funded Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development-Additional Financing (USMID-AF) Program implemented by 22 Municipal Councils namely Arua, Gulu, Kitgum, Lira, Apac, Soroti, Moroto, Mbale, Tororo, Busia, Kamuli, Jinja, Lugazi, Entebbe, Hoima, Mubende, Fort Portal, Kasese, Mbarara, Ntungamo, Kabale and Masaka were audited and assessment of the performance of these projects across the 22 municipalities carried out including a selected sample of non-USMID i.e. Uganda Road Fund (URF) funded projects, and Schools Facilities Grant (SFG)/Transitional Development Grant (TDG)/Discretional Development Equalisation Grant (DDEG) funded projects implemented in the participating municipalities.

The total contract value of the projects assessed was UGX 192,742,021,942. Below is a summary of the Key findings I noted, the details of which are included in the consolidated audit report for the 22 Municipal Councils and the 22 Individual reports issued separately;

- Overpayments and irregular expenditure on USMID and Non USMID projects were noted during the audit. This comprised of overpayments of UGX. 214,862,488 and UGX 459,323,494 on USMID projects and Non-USMID projects respectively. The audit assessment also revealed various questionable expenditures, irregular payments, and potential financial losses attributable to different contractual irregularities totaling to UGX. 817,571,137 on the USMID funded projects in Arua, Jinja and Mbale Municipalities.

- All the municipalities had completed their projects by the time of the audit and the entire infrastructure in the municipalities was in use with the exception of Entebbe whose project was phased. Although the projects were finally completed there were delays in completion of the projects within the stipulated contract timelines.

- During physical inspection of the municipalities of Mbale, Moroto and Lira, major defects were noted such as missing draining/emptying pipe on the

---

soaking tank (leads to poor drainage), Clogged manholes and missing manhole covers, potholes on roads and poor drainage leading to ponding.

- All the participating municipalities implemented environmental protection measures with the exception of Arua Municipality. Further, all the participating municipalities implemented social/safety measures except Soroti and Tororo Municipalities.

- Inadequate allocation of funds in the budget for operation and maintenance of USMID infrastructure was noted in the municipalities except for the municipalities of Lira, Hoima, Fort Portal, Masaka and Gulu.

I advised the Accounting officers of the Municipal Councils to ensure that;

- All amounts overpaid are recovered by the respective municipalities.
- Contractors have updated work programs and delays in delivery of projects within stipulated contract timelines should be penalized by invoking liquidated damages clauses
- Inspections are carried out during the DLP as some defects can only surface while the structure is in use and report on the progress of the structure during the period and have all the identified major defects rectified.
- All municipalities should plan, budget and implement operation and maintenance activities to avoid early deterioration of the facilities.

Conclusion

Owing to the challenges faced by the Municipal Councils during the delivery of USMID- AF Urban infrastructure as highlighted in this report, audit observed that these challenges notable improvements have been noted in planning, cost control enforcement of internal controls for certification, supervision and monitoring, and general contract management for the USMID Infrastructure projects, however these gains have not been translated to the Non USMID projects as URF, SFG,DDEG accordingly the Town Clerks must ensure that Non USMID projects are equally effectively monitored and supervised to ensure delivery of the works within the planned cost, quality and time requirements

**4.2.**  
Value for Money audit and assessment of Infrastructure projects implemented by 60 Local Governments under the UgIFT Program for Construction of Seed Schools and Health Facilities in the Education and Health Sectors

For the financial year 2020/21 a total of 109 infrastructure projects implemented by 60 Local Governments involving the construction of seed schools and Health centre IIs under the World Bank funded Uganda Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) Programme for Results was audited and assessment of the performance of these projects across the 60 Local Governments municipalities carried out for the Education Sector and Health Sector.

---

Under the UgIFT programme, the World Bank committed the total of US$500m over the period FY 2018/19 to FY 2023/24 to support decentralized services in Education, Health, Water and Environment, and Agriculture (micro-scale irrigation) as well as support I  
nterventions in Refugee host communities, With this financial support, Government committed to construct Seed Secondary Schools and Upgrade Health Centre IIs to IIIs in Sub-Counties, extend rural water to underserved communities including the newly constructed seed Secondary Schools and Health Centre IIIs, and also provide Small Scale Irrigation equipment to farmers to enhance their productivity.

The scope of the audit and assessment covered 53 seed secondary schools’ construction projects with an overall total contract sum of UGX 111,860,803,846 and 57 health centre construction projects with an overall total contract sum of UGX 33,743,610,012.

Below is a summary of the Key findings noted, the details of which are included in the consolidated audit report for the 60 Local Governments and the 60 Individual reports issued separately;

- In assessing the adequacy of the design process for the buildings, evidence of needs assessment, presence of geotechnical investigations report, design report, drawings and specifications were considered as key requirements, it was observed that detailed design reports were not availed to all local governments by the Ministry of Education.

- Overpayments and irregular expenditure amounting to UGX 3,153,351,606 was noted during payment for construction works in some of the seed schools. Furthermore, UGX 3,588,640,939 were made without providing the breakdown of work items being certified.

- During physical inspection of the Seed school infrastructure works, the participating LGs with exception of 3 LGs had defects such as honeycombing in concrete, absence of anti-sag rods, cracks in the ceilings, absence of expansion joint in the ICT blocks, exposed steel reinforcement, inadequate painting in the roof structures.

The observed defects, if not addressed, will result in increased maintenance costs for the local governments.

- In assessing the adequacy of the design process for the buildings, evidence of needs assessment, presence of geotechnical investigations report, design report, drawings and specifications were considered as key requirements. It was observed that 39 local governments did not carry out needs assessment, geotechnical investigations, produce design reports in addition work specifications were also omitted.

- Overpayments and irregular expenditure totalling to UGX 920,905,442 were noted during payment for construction works of the Health Centre IIs in LGs and municipalities. Furthermore, UGX 209,175,652 were made without providing the breakdown of work items being certified.

---

- Review of the status of the contractors’ equipment mobilization under construction of HCs revealed that out of the 56 local governments, only the 4 local governments had evidence that the contractors mobilized all required equipment. Further, only 13 local governments had evidence that the contractors mobilized all required equipment under the construction of seed schools.

- Review of land ownership revealed that 7 local governments did not avail any evidence of acquisition or ownership of the land on which the Seed schools and health centres were constructed.

I advised the Accounting officers of the Local Governments to ensure that;

- Prior to implementation of any infrastructural projects of similar nature; all due design procedures such as needs assessment, geotechnical investigations are undertaken and documented by the local governments to facilitate adequate designs.

- Overpayments in respect of quantities certified in excess of the actual works executed worth UGX. 3,153,351,606 in the Education Sector and UGX. 920,905,442 in the Health Sector should be recovered. In addition, the technical officers should review the other items that were not part of the audit sample and have additional checks in the certification process to minimise the errors in quantification.

- Investigate the basis of payment of the questionable amounts totalling to UGX.3,588,640,939 in the Education Sector and UGX.209,175,652 in the Health Sector and take appropriate action.

- Enforce the requirement for contractors to fully mobilize adequate equipment to undertake the works. In addition, any demobilization during contract implementation should be with the written approval of the project manager/supervisor.

- All the defects/omissions observed should be corrected. Furthermore, additional inspection of the contractor’s works should be undertaken and any defects identified remedied immediately.

- Fast track the process of obtaining formal ownership of the land on which the infrastructure is being constructed. Going forward, Accounting Officers should ensure that projects of similar nature are constructed on land that is formally owned by the respective local government.

Conclusion

Owing to the challenges faced by the various local governments during the delivery of UgIFT infrastructure projects in the education and health sectors as highlighted in this report, audit observed that these challenges are a result of gaps/weaknesses in the planning and costing of works, enforcement of internal controls for certification, supervision and monitoring, and general contract management.

---

Accordingly, the relevant stakeholders should enhance the capacities of the local governments through involvement of local governments in the planning for future projects of similar nature, organizing tailor made trainings for technical staff, review of the staff structure in the engineering department and ensure that it is adequate and appropriately staffed. The relevant ministries should develop standardized guidelines for costing of civil works and strengthen the monitoring and supervision role in local governments.

**4.3.**  
Engineering Audit of Selected Road and Building Projects in Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA)

For the financial year 2020/21, a total of 24 public works projects (Road upgrade/rehabilitation, signalization of road junctions, and building projects) with a total contract sum/value of UGX.333.72tn were implemented by KCCA. A sample of Eight (8) projects (road, signalization and building projects) with a contract value of UGX. 276.92tn. were selected for audit. This sample represents 82.98% of the value of the 24 projects.

Eight (8) of the KCCA projects were sampled for audit comprising of three (3) road projects funded by the World Bank under the Second Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (KIIDP 2) and five (5) projects funded by the Government of Uganda (GoU). The five projects funded by GoU comprised of three (3) road upgrading/ rehabilitation projects and two (2) building projects, the following key observations were noted on these projects

i.  
Delayed relocation of existing services

Delayed relocation of existing utilities for water and power for the three KIIDP road projects of Kulambira ring road 4.82Km, spur to Najjera road 0.7Km, Nakawa Ntinda road 2.8Km, Kabuusu –Bunamwaya – Lweza road 8.06Km and Lukuli road 7.71Km resulted in significant delays in execution of road works by up to 17 months. The Accounting Officer explained that public utility services by Statutory Undertakers (UMEME, NITA, UG POLICE, NWSC and UTL) in particular Kampala City are so complex that even the owners/operators do not know the exact location of their infrastructure, In addition, obtaining of shut-down permits from UMEME was always delayed as UMEME had to fit request within their planned shutdown programme.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that relocation of services is implemented in time, and works executed as per the approved work programme.

ii.  
Unjustified and overpayments amounting to UGX 1.355Bn

It was noted that on some of the projects, payments equivalent to UGX.1.355Bn had been made for quantities of works in excess of those executed, not backed up by the necessary payment supporting documentation or contrary to the contract conditions as follows;

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the amounts certified and paid in excess of the quantities executed, unaccounted for payments and irregular/unjustified payments are recovered from the contractors prior to concluding the contracts.

iii.  
Delayed Land Acquisitions for the KIIDP Road projects

There was delayed acquisition of land by the Authority for the two KIIDP road projects of Kulambiro ring road 4.82 Km, Spur to Najjera road 0.7 Km, Nakawa Ntinda road 2.8 km and Acacia Avenue 1.45 Km under Lot 1, and Kabuusu – Bunamwaya – Lweza road 8.06Km for Lot 2 resulting in delays of more than 12 months significantly affected the progress and timely completion of the works on these projects. The Accounting Officer explained that it has always been the plan of KCCA to expedite land expropriation in time and issue commencement orders for sites that are free of any encumbrances, however the delayed land acquisition was caused by absentee land lords, and unwillingness by some PAPs to accept the Chief government Valuers value of compensation.

I advised the Accounting Officer that for future projects, the entity should ensure that contractors are issued with commencement orders when the site for construction is fully accessible.

---

iv.  
Failure to undertake Ground Investigations for Building Projects

Detailed ground investigations to inform the foundation designs were not undertaken during the design of Kitintatle Market and the Maternity ward at Kiswa Health Center. Such omissions can lead to inadequate designs which may compromise the safety of the buildings during usage. The Accounting Officer explained that for the Kitintale Market and Kiswa Health Center Projects, no funds were availed for geotechnical investigations

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that detailed ground investigations are undertaken to ensure that the constructed buildings can safely be put to usage when completed and going forward, the Accounting Officer should ensure that for projects of similar nature, detailed ground investigations are undertaken during the design phase.

5.0. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AUDITS

In accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act (NAA) 2008, I am mandated to audit all the government investments and carry out special audit engagements that include information technology (IT) Audits. Accordingly, I planned and executed my audits following ISSAI 200: Fundamental Principles of Public-Sector Auditing and INTOSAI 5100 guidance.

I conducted three (2) audits namely; Information Systems Audit of Civil Aviation Authority; the Academic Information Management System (AIMS) and Uganda National Land Information System (Ug-NLIS). Below are redacted version of my key findings.

5.1.  
Information Systems Audit of Civil Aviation Authority

**i.** Disintegrated Systems/Manual Interfaces

The entity has twelve independent IT systems which are not integrated to share information. As such, information sharing was purely manual despite being explicitly provided for in the respective system requirements and contracts. This increases the risk of human errors and abuse during data extraction and re- entry. This was attributed to lack of integrated planning for IT interventions.

Failure to automate sharing of information between systems compromises the data integrity, creates opportunities for fraudulent falsification of records. In addition, maintaining multiple systems increases maintenance costs and increases man hours because of manual extraction and entry of data which would otherwise be used for other productive activities.

I advised management to comprehensively plan for IT projects. In the meantime, management may explore interfacing the systems as they plan to implement an Enterprise Resource System to ensure that various departments share data seamlessly.

---

**ii.**  
Lack of Integrated Revenue Systems at CAA

Despite a big shift to digitalisation and the Authority spending UGX.1.13Bn in acquiring a Passenger Tracking System with the aim of ascertaining the number and identity of passengers on a given flight, two years later, the system was not being used consistently and by-passed from time to time. As a result, the Authority has no independent mechanism to ascertain the number of passengers on each flight, but entirely depends on manual submissions from airlines to bill for revenues. There is a risk of under declaration of passengers which can lead to revenue loss. In addition, the system produces incomplete information.

Under the circumstances, there is a risk that the amounts disclosed in the financial statements were not accurate and the system does not provide reliable information.

I advised management to explore possibilities of enforcing the use of the system.

**iii.** Failure to capitalise Information System Intangible Assets in the Financial Statements

Despite spending UGX.4.723Bn on system development, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has not capitalised intangible assets. These include licenses, software, operating systems, subscriptions.

As a result, the assets value is understated in financial statements.

Management explained that they have engaged a consultant to carry out verification of all UCAA Assets; ICT Assets inclusive.

I advised management to ensure that such assets are properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements.

**iv.**  
Failure to implement Cargo Handling IT Systems

One of the major revenue streams of CAA is cargo handling fees levied on the airline operators. Although CAA contracted two companies through concession agreements where 5% is charged on cash exports, 10% on general handling and 10% on standard charge related to aircraft and passenger handling. The Authority does not have an independent system to track and reconcile the revenue collected before charging the percentage as per the concession agreements. The information is not shared in real-time due to lack of appropriate IT systems and they rely on information provided by the contractors.

This situation poses a risk of loss of revenue as a result of under-declaration of income from cargo handling operations by the handling companies.

Management explained that they have initiated procurement for extension of the Point of Sale (POS) system to new concessionaires. The Specifications include provision for interface with the existing Cargo Management systems.

---

I advised management to expedite the procurement and installation of the system. Meanwhile, CAA should engage the contractors to gain read-only access to the systems and extract accurate information for monitoring and reconciliation.

**v.**  
Tenants/Concessionaires without Point of Sale (POS) machines

The Point of Sale (POS) system is being used to track sales of airport tenants to inform the rental charges, which are a percentage of the sales. However, it was noted that after ten years of implementation, only 7 out of the 18 concessioners have POS terminals installed which creates a risk of revenue loss. I also noted that even for those using the POS system, were using them selectively, hence under-declaration of sales.

In addition, there is a risk that tax-free goods are being sold to non-passengers compounding revenue losses. This results into loss of revenue both to CAA and URA.

Management explained that they had 14 concessionaire locations at the deployment of the POS system in 2013. In addition, CAA will deploy a new system to cover the new locations and the procurement has been initiated.

I advised management to fast-track the procurement and deployment of the new system.

5.2. Information Systems Audit of the Academic Management Information System (AIMS)

**i.**  
Contested Ownership of the AIMS (Source Code)

The Ministry of ICT and National Guidance through its rationalization policy of promoting locally developed information systems agreed with Kyambogo University (KYU) to enhance its E-Kampus for sharing with other Public Universities and Self Accounting Tertiary Institutions (PUSATIs). Subsequently the user requirements were reviewed, functionalities improved and the system was rebranded to AIMS.

A review of the framework contract between The Ministry of ICT and National Guidance and the supplier (Zeenode Uganda Limited) states that; the purchaser (MoICT&NG) acknowledges and agrees that the supplier and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights in the services and the documentation. It was brought to my attention during my review that there is a disagreement of ownership of the source code and the parties are in court.

I await the outcome of the court decision.

---

**ii.**  
Unclear Ownership of the system

The Ministry of ICT & NG undertook the enhancement and deployment at the Public Universities and Self Accounting Tertiary Institutions (PUSATIs) of the E- Kampus into the AIMS under the innovation fund at a cost of UGX 2.1 Bn. Subsequently, the Ministry of ICT & NG procured technical support and maintenance services of the same system.

However, I noted that the “vendor” (Zeenode) was charging UGX. 30,000 per student for use of the system.

This casts doubt on the ownership of the system. I further noted that the system was switched off for two weeks December 2020 over non-payment of service and maintenance fees.

As earlier noted, the case is before Court. I await Court’s decision.

**iii.**  
No right to audit provided in the contract

The contract between Ministry of ICT & NG and the supplier did not include any "right to audit by third party" clause. As a result, during the execution of the audit, I was denied access to key components of the Information system and I cannot provide assurance on their adequacy.

Management explained that it will consider including the clause on Right to Audit software, systems, data, in Contracts in collaboration with MoFPED and PPDA.

I advised management to engage all stakeholders to make a provision for providing audit assurance in the contract.

**iv.**  
Failure to update the Source Code held in Escrow

The contract between Ministry of ICT & NG and the supplier provides that any additions and inventions added by the purchaser and those that are unique to the purchaser will be documented and copyrighted to the purchaser upon installation and development.

I noted, however, that even though the AIMS has been in continuous development for the last three years, there is no evidence that the original source code held in Escrow has been updated and neither was copyrighting of all changes to the AIMS after the contract signing.

Management acknowledged the omission and stated that the source code was not periodically updated. The Ministry committed to ensure continuous periodic updates to all source code held in Escrow.

I advised management to keep the code updated in real time.

**v.**  
Data Ownership of the AIMS

A review of the AIMS operations revealed that there is no clear data owner of the universities' data. The system vendor;

---

- Has unlimited access to the application that is used to process the PUSATI information.
- Has control over the AIMS database and operating system environment
- Has the only Administrator privileges on the AIMS for all the PUSATIs.
- Issues access rights to the AIMS system users.

This presents a conflict of interest as well as data integrity risk when the system developer has continuous access to the production environment.

Management explained that Clause 19 (ii) of the Framework contract specifies that each PUSATI shall own its individual data and processes that they run on the System. The Ministry shall ensure that remedial action is taken as per recommendation as part of the new Policy under development.

I advised management to consider remedial action that would limit the risk of unlimited access and manipulation to both privileged and critical information of the PUSATIs

**vi.**  
No data protection after contract termination

I noted that in the framework contract signed between the MoICT & NG and the supplier, there is no provision for how the PUSATI data is to be handled at the end of the contract. Without such a provision, the PUSATIs have no way to require the third party to return institutional data or otherwise dispose of such data in a way that does not jeopardise the information security and reputation of the institutions or their affiliated institutions.

Management committed to address the matter as part of the Policy on System development for Government.

I advised management to devise means of ensuring that the data will be safely returned or destroyed in order to avoid the associated risks.

**vii.**  
Deviation from the Contract terms by ZUL

Although the Framework Contract between MoICT and the suppler stipulates that the supplier shall ensure uninterrupted and error-free services, on 12th December 2020, the supplier without consequence, denied services to all PUSATIs for a period of two weeks citing alleged non-payment by MoICT & NG. This led to loss of revenue, critical time and information loss thus delaying decision making.

Management promised to engage the vendor and ensure future contracts guard against such occurrences.

I advised management to engage the Attorney General and devise means of protecting data as they wait for the disposal of the court case.

---

**viii.** Sustainability of the AIMS

The maintenance contract with the supplier expired in December 2020 and MoICT&NG had to pay the vendor an additional UGX.1Bn to guarantee continued support and maintenance until the 30th June 2021. It was proposed that beyond that period, PUSATIs would meet their own costs at UGX.30,000 per student per year, but there was no agreement or MOU with the system provider to ensure compliance by the PUSATIs. There is a risk of non-continued use of the system despite such investments by government.

I advised management to ensure that all foreseeable costs of the system are analysed and evaluate sustainability of the project. In future, GoU should aim at outright acquisition or ownership and development of any public information system to avoid escalation of costs and ensure sustainability.

**ix.**  
Lack of Change Management Procedures

According to Section A.12.1.2 of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Changes to the organisation, business processes, information processing, facilities and systems that affect information security shall be controlled. I established that no change management policies were in place at either MoICT&NG or the universities in regard to the AIMS and as such, Change Requests from users and other changes deemed fit by the supplier were implemented on the live environment without any documented authorisation from either MoICT or PUSATIs management.

I advised management to integrate change management policies/procedures in project design and implementation.

5.3. Information Systems Audit of Uganda National Land Information System (Ug- NLIS)

The Government of Uganda sought assistance from the World Bank to make reforms in the Lands Sector through the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP). The Modernizing of the land administration activity was implemented through a project named the "Design, Supply, Installation and Implementation of the National Land Information System Infrastructure (DeSINLISI) by the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD). The main objective of the DeSINLISI) project was to establish a National Land Information System Infrastructure for the entire country to foster efficiency and transparency in land transactions processing as well as uphold the land tenure security.

I undertook an audit of the system with the aim of assessing it effectiveness in supporting the land registration process to achieve intended objectives.

Below are the key findings: **i.** Land Registration Process

I reviewed the land registration process and noted the following gaps that have led to poor service delivery:

---

- Despite investing substantial amounts of money in the land system, the land registration processes are largely still manual and no transactions take place without a manual file.

- The system encourages rampant use of agents; sometimes, titles change hands four times before getting to the registrar.

- Currently, changes on land titles are effected using manual typewriters, which are prone to error and waste time due to a requirement of scanning out to capture the manual changes.

- There is no mechanism of communication to clients whose titles are ready; I noted that there are a number of duplicate copies of titles that have not been picked by clients, some as far back as 1997.

- The system does not provide for functionality to perform electronic printing and sealing of land titles as a security feature in the certificate of titles.

The above gaps have led to unjustified delays in processing of land transactions, frustrating the public.

I advised management to automate the land registration process; enhance system functionality to enable registered proprietors to create accounts to eliminate land agents (brokers) and an SMS alert system for the public to keep track of submitted applications.

**ii.** Subdivision of plots

The workflow process is so lengthy as it has seventeen levels of approval with duplicated roles. District physical planners as key technical players were left out of the system workflow process. The system workflow process is not flexible to allow queries at different approval levels without cancellation of the transaction. In addition, the applications involving surveys are submitted physically at the Zonal office, despite the investment in the surveyor's portal to aid the process.

The public frustration has led to unethical ways of quickening the process, thus creating fertile ground for corruption.

Management explained that it will enhance the land system functionality and workflow process to improve service delivery.

I advised management to consider a review of the subdivision and workflow process to create efficiency.

**iii.**  
Failure to Operationalise the Approved IT Staff Structure

I noted that Ug-NLIS structure has not been operationalized with all senior positions still vacant despite the criticality of system to the country. Notably, system is largely supported by temporary short term contract staff who have not been recruited into main stream public service but continue to perform critical system roles such as database administration.

---

The use of temporary staff to oversee and support critical IT system exposes the entire investment to high risk. Management explained that they have made submission to the Public Service Commission (PSC).

I advised management to follow up with the PSC to expedite the process.

**iv.**  
Failure by Uganda Lands Commission (ULC) to Utilise the UG-NLIS

I reviewed the Land information system and noted that Uganda Land Commission (ULC) does not utilize the Ug-NLIS to process land transactions (leases of public land). I noted that lease transactions were manually processed outside the system.

It should be noted that ULC was involved in the development of system and user requirements and acceptance of Ug-NLIS as a solution that meets the Commission’s business needs. Further, I noted that ULC acquired another system which duplicates the functionality of the Ug-NLIS at a cost of UGX.500 million.

The investment by ULC in a duplicate land registration system is deemed a wasteful expenditure. Management informed me that the Commission has commenced processing of public leases using the Ug-NLIS.

I have advised Management to ensure that all public leases processed outside the Ug-NLIS should be captured into the system as a backlog.

**v.** Overlapping Land Parcels

There are a number of parcels in the system whose geo-referenced coordinates were erroneously captured which created distortions in the cadastral data of the Ug-NLIS.

The errors manifest where parcels on the system stretch beyond the boundaries and overreach neighbouring parcels such as road reserves, protected areas and neighbouring plots. Where overlaps exist, the system may create delays in processing of deed plans or titles.

Management informed me that it has prioritised cadastral data cleaning.

I advised Management to institute mechanisms to ensure quality control of survey data from surveyors and input validation.

6.0. SPECIAL VERIFICATIONS

In accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act, 2008, I undertook two special verifications in the telecom sector, and below is a summary of my findings;

6.1.  
Verification of Assets and Liabilities for Uganda Telecom (In-Administration)

In accordance with Section 13(2) and 22 of the National Audit Act 2008, I undertook a special audit, for verification of liabilities of UTL comprising preferred taxes, UCC liability, UCECPS, administration costs, creditor payments and TDB Loan and assets on a request by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.

Below are the findings of the verification;

**i.**  
Verification of Trade Development Bank Loan

Out of the claimed USD.16.51 Million by Trade Development Bank, the verified and approved outstanding loan amounted to USD.9.31 Million The balance of USD.7.24 Million which relates to default interest charged during the period from 22 nd May 2017 to 31 st May 2021 when UTL was under administration, could not be verified, as it appears to be contrary to the Ugandan Insolvency Act 2011 and the attendant regulations, which provide that interest payable in respect of any period after the commencement of a liquidation and/or insolvency shall be suspended.

Government was advised to seek the opinion of the Attorney General, before the amount relating to default interest is allowed.

**ii.** Verification of Other Creditors

I verified claims from the creditors as at 30 th June 2021 totalling to UGX. 302.74Bn as summarised in the table 30 below;

Table 30: Creditors Verified

| SN | Item | Amount - UGX |  
|---|---|---|  
| 1 | Consolidated Tax Liability (PAYE, Local Exercise, | 9,786,780,845 |  
|| Withholding Tax, Value Added Tax) |<|  
| 2 UCC liability  62,469,304,749 |<|<|  
| 3 | UCECPS liability | 2,353,904,321 |  
| 4  Verified Creditors Liability (Pre & Post Administration period) 63,079,412,417 |<|<|  
| 5 | Un remitted NSSF Deductions | 15, 462, 575,874 |  
| 6 UTL Pension Liability for former UPTC employees  165,048,246,917 |<|<|  
|| Total | 302,737,649,249 |  


I noted that creditors worth UGX. 28.74Bn were not verified due to insufficient information and creditors totalling to 336.3Bn were subject to court proceedings and therefore not verified.

108

---

The Government should explore ways of settling the above liabilities to avoid litigation and associated costs.

**iii.** Verification of Non-Current Assets

The current estimated value of UTL Non-Current Assets is UGX.184Bn which was computed based on independent valuers reports of M/s Bageine and Company (September 2017) and Elite Realty Limited (June 2018). Adjustments were made for depreciation and disposals since the valuation date to arrive at the current estimated value. There is need for re-valuation by the Chief Government Valuer to ascertain the current market values.

In addition, UTL has a 9.13% shareholding in a company (i.e. WIOCC) which was valued between USD.146.2 – 181.2 million, by an independent valuer commissioned by WIOCC in December 2020. The Administrator further informed me of an ongoing offer by an equity investor into WIOCC, who has valued the company at USD.171 million by the time of my verification. This would imply that the UTL shareholding of 9.13% in WIOCC, could be valued at USD.15.61 Million (i.e. approximately UGX.55.45Bn exchanged at UGX.3,551.71 for one USD), as of 30th June, 2021. This would significantly increase the value of total assets of UTL.

There are disputes on ownership of 11 Properties worth UGX.57.5Bn between Uganda Telecom Limited (UTL), POSTA (U) Ltd, Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC), and other entities.

Government should consider resolving the disputes before liquidating the company. **iv.** Verification of Receivables

Receivables totalling to UGX.113.65Bn were presented for verification. Due to time limitations and sensitivity of the matter, I could not verify receivables, however the process of verification had commenced under the administrator. I await the outcome of the verification exercise.

6.2.  
Verification of Terminal Benefits/Pension of former Employees UPTC in Respect of Civil Appeal No. 230 Of 2013 And No.10 Of 2014 Of The Court Of Appeal Of Uganda

I undertook a country wide verification exercise of 1,837 former employees/ claimants of the defunct Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (UPTC) in accordance with the orders of the Court of Appeal in respect to Civil Appeal No. 230 of 2013 and No. 10 of 2014.

Below are my findings;

The claims presented for verification in the actuarial report as at 30 th June 2020 and are summarized in the Table 31 below;

109

I verified the claims presented and summarized the findings per entity as presented below;

**i.** Verified Claims – UGX.213,026,888,318

The total verified amount of UGX.213,026,888,318 is payable to 1,254 claimants under UTL (in-Administration), Uganda Posts Limited (UPL) and the defunct UPTC as summarised in the Table 35 below;

Table 32: Summary of Verified claims payable

| S/N Entity Total No. of Claimants Total claimants verified Total Amount Verified Payable as at June 2021- UGX |<|<|<|<|  
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | UTL | 1,065 | 882 | 165,048,246,917 |

| Total 1,484 1,254 213,026,888,318 |<|<|<|<|  


I advised the Government to make the necessary budgetary provisions to cater for settlement of the above claims.

**ii.** Fully Settled Claims

Although the Actuarial report from the Privatisation Unit under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) submitted included claims from former employees of Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) and Post Bank Uganda Limited (PBUL) respectively, from the verification carried out I verified that these entities had duly settled the claims of 21 beneficiaries totalling to UGX.1,124,966,993.

This verification gave assurance that the Government had fulfilled its obligation to the respective beneficiaries, thereby eliminating any risk of possible double payment of claims in this regard.

110

---

**iii.**  
Conflict between the legal representative and the beneficiaries

During the audit, I obtained information relating to the fact that a section of the claimants had a disagreement with their legal advocate, allegedly from failure to remit funds received from UTL and UPL to all the claimants. UTL in Administration and UPL transferred a total of UGX.4,184,469,245 to the lawyer as part payment of their obligations.

I advised the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) and the Attorney General to take note of the conflict and ensure that the dispute is resolved before funds are disbursed to benefit the rightful claimants.

7.0.  
HIGHLIGHTS OF VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT RESULTS

7.1. Value for Money Audit on the Management of Government Investments by Uganda Development Corporation

The Government of Uganda has committed over UGX.223.9Bn in various investment projects under Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) over the years 2016/17 to 2019/20. These investments which are highlighted as government priorities from National Development Plan (NDP I), through to NDP III, are meant to promote social and economic development and contribute to poverty eradication by increasing national and regional economic growth and development.

The objective of the value for money audit was to assess the effectiveness of UDC processes in the management of Government Investments through planning, implementation and monitoring of such investments.

I sampled eight (8) investment projects worth UGX. 191.5 Bn as of 30 th June, 2020 including; Soroti Fruit factory, Kigezi Highland Tea factory, Kayonza Tea factory, Mabale tea factory, Luwero Fruits factory, Moroto Cement factory, Isingiro Fruit factory and Atiak Sugar Factory.

The following were the key findings; **i.** Project Planning

I noted that only one out of the eight selected projects was dully subjected to the planning process representing 12.5%. The objective of the planning process is to justify investment of government funds in identified projects. As a result of ineffective planning, two projects failed to take off while there was a change of scope, cost and implementation strategy for the other five investment projects.

111

---

UDC management should ensure that all Investment projects follow the due planning and identification processes as documented in the investment guide. This will increase on the success rate for those projects that are properly planned, identified and appraised.

**ii.** Project Implementation

Audit noted that UDC had not been able to have five investment projects operating at full capacity as expected representing 37.5% of the eight sampled projects. The projects faced different challenges as summarised in the table 33 below;

Table 33: Challenges of Project Implementation

| S/N | Project Name | Amount Invested as at 30 th June | Challenge |  
|---|---|---|---|  
||<| 2020 (UGX in Bn) |<|

||<|<| factory capacity |  
| Total  157.25 |<|<|<|  


Management should improve implementation processes by ensuring that guidelines are in place, and that sufficient staffing is deployed. Additionally, the institution should lobby for a ‘Fund-based’ financing approach of the institution, instead of ‘projectised’ financing where funds are sent to UDC already tagged to an investment project to be funded. This will allow flexibility during implementation of investment projects.

112

---

**iii.** Monitoring and Evaluation

I noted that the oversight role in all the eight sampled investment projects had not been fully undertaken and thus, the projects were not operating at full capacity as expected. This was greatly attributed to weak governance structures and non-existing/inadequate Boards in those investment projects supported as partnership ventures. This ultimately caused delays in decision making, financing and signing of contractual agreements.

UDC management should improve the monitoring and oversight role in the government investments by ensuring that the monitoring frameworks are established and followed- up at both management and Board levels.  
Overall Conclusion

Government has invested over UGX.200Bn in various sectors of the economy with the objective of boosting value addition mainly in the agricultural sector. There has been a noted increase in both tea and sugar production. It should however be noted that the levels of outputs and other expected benefits are not commensurate with the investments due to challenges of budgeting and planning, lack of feasibility studies and criteria for allocation of funding, inadequate contractual arrangements to clarify roles and targets and limited oversight and monitoring of investments. There is a risk of failure to achieve the intended objectives. There is still potential for improvement by ensuring UDC staffing levels are increased to undertake the above-mentioned tasks. It is also necessary to enhance autonomy for UDC by providing capitalisation instead of project related financing, so that management is flexible in allocation and re-allocate resources where they are urgently required at the time.

7.2.  
A Value for Money Draft Audit Report on The Afforestation and Restoration of Selected Central Forest Reserves (CFRs) by the National Forestry Authority (NFA)

The National Forestry Authority (NFA) was established under section 52 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 (NFTPA). The objective of NFA is to manage the Central Forest reserves, expand and promote partnership arrangements, ensure equitable supply of forest and non-forest products and services and enhance organisational sustainability.

The country’s forest cover is managed by different stakeholders comprising; Uganda Wildlife Authority, National Forestry Authority and Privately owned forest plantations.

The forest cover loss over the years from 1990 to the last biomass study in 2017 is estimated at 58.9%. Similarly, the CFR forest cover under NFA dropped from 62.5% (791,240ha) of the NFA forest cover to 45.8% (579,257ha) in the same period. This trend was contrary to Sustainable Development Goal 15 which required governments to ensure the restoration of forests and increase forest cover in line with obligations under international agreements by 2020.

The overall objective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place by the NFA towards the restoration and establishment of new plantations in the central forest reserves, between the period of 2016 and 2020.

The following are the key findings from the study;

**i.**  
Restoration and establishment of new plantations

Audit noted that management achieved 11,173ha (78%) of their planned outputs (14,277ha) for both restoration planting and establishing new tree plantations, which contributed to only 0.88% of the national forest cover (1,265,742ha) over the four-year period.

Considering the current rate of forest restoration, it will require 75.8 years for NFA to restore the national forest cover to 62.5% of was it was in the year 1990.Similarly, even if NFA was to meet its targets of 14,277ha in the four-year period, it would still take 59.3 years to restore the CFRs to the 1990 forest cover in Uganda.

The non-achievement of targets to restore forest cover was caused by inadequacies in the planning and budgeting process; land management; monitoring and inspections; and collaboration with institutional stakeholders.

**ii.**  
Coordination and planning in the Forest Sector

I noted weaknesses in coordination in the regulation of activities/projects under a single mandate that impact of national forest cover. There are inconsistencies and inadequacies in mainstreaming initiatives to increase forest cover across government and private sector which has led to limited national forest coverage of 12.4% and NFA forest cover of 45.8%.

**iii.**  
Monitoring and Evaluation, and inspections.

It was observed that out of the expected 16 monitoring reports in the four-year period ending 30th June, 2020, only 4 (25%) were prepared in the entire four-year period. In addition, NFA budgeted to receive UGX.320m for monitoring in the four years under review, however, it received UGX.91.8million (29%) of which UGX 88.8million was spent. There was limited uptake of monitoring and evaluation recommendations which led to led to destruction of the newly restored forests by encroachers.

**iv.** NFA collaborations

It was established that seventeen (17) MOUs were signed with different government agencies, out of the planned twenty (20), representing an 85% performance. Although these collaborations contributed to the restoration and establishment of new plantations, there were inadequacies in providing the planned quantity of seedings.

In addition, twenty (20) Collaborative Forest management (CFM) agreements were signed with forest edge communities, out of the planned twenty-eight (28) over the last three years. There were inadequacies of; staffing, limited sensitization and coordination between the CFM stakeholders. As a result, communities were sighted to be involved in encroachment of newly restored forests in some instances.

114

---

Key Recommendations  
The National Forestry Authority should;

- Engage all relevant stakeholders to ensure sustainable coordination and comprehensive planning initiatives to enhance mainstreaming efforts to increase forest cover in the country.

- Improve on its collaboration and sensitization efforts with all stakeholders to protect all forest land and undertake a process of titling all gazetted forest reserves and national forests to curb illegal encroachment. The National Land Information System (NLIS) should include control measures to prevent illegal titling of gazetted forest land.

- Continue engaging the relevant Government authorities to fast-track the revision and approval of the NFA organizational structure, to enhance the institutional capacity to manage national forests.

Overall Conclusion

Whereas the National Forestry Authority has undertaken specific interventions aimed at increasing forest cover through restoration and establishing new plantations; inadequate coordination, planning, monitoring, collaboration with communities have led to a limited increase in the NFA forest cover over the years. In some instances, increased encroachment, land encumbrances through issuance of title over the NFA land, limited community sensitization and involvement, inadequate prioritization of restoration and new forest establishment have contributed to the dismal 45.8% forest cover under NFA and national cover of 12.3%.

It is hoped that despite the increased population that is exerting pressure on the rather limited national forest cover, the lessons learnt and recommendations will be applied to fulfil the objectives of the NFA, forest sector and country.

7.3.  
A Value for Money Audit on the Implementation of the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD)

I undertook a Value for Money to assess the extent to which the Programme achieved its intended objectives.

The Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) is an initiative of the Government of Uganda that is aimed at empowering women to improve their income levels and their contribution to economic development; by improving their access to financial services and equipping them with skills for enterprise growth, value addition and marketing of their products and services.

The Programme has disbursed UGX.107 Bn to 11,256 women groups, benefitting over 135,000 women, over the five-year period (2015/16 to 2019/20) in the first Phase. The

115

---

programme through its revolving fund recovered over UGX.16 billion from the loans disbursed to the women which funds were available for financing new women groups.

Despite the achievements registered, the audit identified the following areas that need to be addressed by the Ministry;

- I noted that 4,185 women had benefited from the Programme under the capacity and skills development component, which translates into 42% of the desired target (10,000 women) according to the UWEP Programme document.

- There were delays in disbursement of funds to the women groups. In some cases, the delays were more than 12 months from time of approval of the applications to receipt of the funds which affected the performance and success of enterprises, specifically those in the agricultural sector, which depend on the rainy seasons for planting. The delays impact on agricultural yields.

- I noted budget cuts for women groups at the MGLSD level (TSU) with some groups receiving less than budgeted funds to implement their enterprises; however, at the Local Government level, explanations for the budget revisions were not effectively communicated to the groups; which hindered implementation of activities of women groups.

- Funds to the tune of UGX 16 Bn remained idle on the recovery account in Bank of Uganda over the five years. Only 6% (UGX 963 million) of the amount had been re- disbursed; which denied the other qualifying women groups access to funds.

- The MGLSD through the UWEP Technical Support Unit did not effectively plan for and coordinate implementation of the activities to facilitate women groups to access markets for their products. In addition, access to appropriate technologies were not catered for in the project design and budgets for the entire 5-year period. The intended objective of the funds disbursed may not be fully realised.

- There was underfunding of monitoring and supervision activities at the Local Government level which affected the frequency of monitoring of beneficiary women groups. The programme gaps at enterprise level could not be adequately identified and corrected on time.

- At the National level, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) undertook only 13 (43%) of the planned 30 monitoring and supervision visits to the regions throughout the five- year period. This resulted in delayed identification of performance gaps and timely remedial actions.

Key Recommendations  
I advised management to do the following;

- Prioritize the capacity and skills development component of the Programme through increased sensitization to ensure that women groups receive the required skills to

116

---

effectively implement selected enterprises. In addition, consider reviewing the funding programme requirements to make training a prerequisite for all groups venturing into value addition enterprises for the first time.

- The programme implementation guidelines should be reviewed to reduce on the time taken between approval and disbursement to improve timely access to funding to the groups. All budgetary cuts should be communicated to beneficiary women groups in time.

- The MGLSD should ensure that the funds recovered are revolved in a timely manner to benefit the intended women groups, and ensure sustainability of the Programme.

- The MGLSD should liaise with MoFPED to mobilise funds to cater for value addition, and monitoring and evaluation activities within the programme.

Overall Concluion

UWEP exceeded its target in attracting 100,000 women beneficiaries over the five year period and managed to put in place implementation guidelines and training of beneficiaries and implementing partners.

However, utilization of funds from the programme’ revolving fund and equipping beneficiaries with value addition and skills for enterprise growth was found to be unsatisfactory and merits Management’s urgent intervention.

The overall prospects of the programme are promising if the challenges of rationalization of the programme funding; delayed funding of beneficiaries; limited focus on skills and capacity development; inadequate coordination of partnering institutions; are addressed.

7.4. A Value for Money Audit Report on the Management of Research Grants by Public Universities in Uganda

Research is any type of systematic investigation, testing and evaluation whose objective is to discover new facts or information and increase the stock of knowledge. It generates new knowledge, which is critical for sustained economic growth and social transformation of Nations.

According to Section 24(2)(a) of the Universities and other Tertiary Institutions Act, 2001 (as amended), a Public University has a function of provision of higher education, promotion of research and advancement of learning. Research is a costly activity and often relies on grants to supplement the existing financial resources. Research grants enable the research community within the Universities to thrive in knowledge sharing and to use research towards solving community-based problems.

Owing to the different challenges in the management of research grants at public universities which is characterised by poor rankings of the universities at continental and world level, and less innovation products from the public universities, the Office of the

117

---

Auditor General undertook an independent assessment of the management of research grants by Public Universities.

The overall audit objective was to assess the adequacy of management of research grants in achieving grant management objectives in Public Universities in Uganda. The audit adopted a case study approach whereby 4 out of the 9 Public Universities in Uganda were considered as cases for the study, these included; Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), Kyambogo University and Busitema University. Below is a summary of key findings and recommendations, the details are found in the subsequent part of the report;

Key Findings

**i.**  
Institutional framework for coordination of research grants activities

- It was noted that all the Public Universities through their respective Councils determine the research policies, research management structures and research direction of the respective Universities. There is no framework to ensure collective planning, coordination and follow-up of research efforts for the different Public Universities to ensure equitable allocation of resources, efficient utilization of academic staff, and that research results contribute to National development.

- It was also established that key research and grant management policies/guidelines were missing at a number of Universities to guide on the efficient and effective management of research activities. Only MUST and Busitema had a grants management policy/manual to guide their grants management processes. Furthermore, the country lacks national regulations and guidelines for research and innovation activities including; sourcing of external grants, development and uptake of technologies and, management and commercialization of intellectual properties.
- Furthermore, the research committees for MUK, MUST and Kyambogo which are responsible for strategic planning and research direction focused more on graduate students’ research with limited emphasis on university grants research.

- It was also noted that out of the 4 Universities, only MUST had a grants office under the DRGT with dedicated staff to support grant activities. It was further noted that Busitema and Kyambogo did not have grants administrators at college/faculty level while at MUK and MUST only the college of Health Sciences and the faculty of medicine respectively had grant administrators to undertake the tasks.

- The most funded area of the research agenda for MUK was health and health systems which accounted for over 50% of the funding with other areas of research getting smaller contributions. In addition, no operational processes were in place to ensure that external grants sourced by MUK & KYU staff are in line with the university’s research agenda. MUST and Busitema University did not have an approved research agenda at University level. Furthermore, the country does not have a clear research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy making.

118

---

**ii.** Resource Mobilization Initiatives

- It was found that MUK, KYU and Busitema have established processes to centrally award competitive research grants from internally generated funds or Government support as initiatives to promote research and innovation in public universities. These processes have in turn enabled staff to seek external grants through proposal writing. The processes however have challenges. MUST on the other hand has not established such processes.

- Out of the 4 universities, only MUK had a consolidated Research Innovation Fund (RIF) for research funds from government. Through continuous lobbying by MUK, government allocated UGX.30bn to the fund; the other universities have not explored this initiative. All the universities have not raised any resources internally into a separate fund for research. This was attributed to government policy of remitting all internally generated revenue into the consolidated fund and therefore appropriating funds through the annual budget process.

- It was noted that for all the 348 grants sampled from the four (4) universities, overheads/indirect costs were not deducted from the funds spent contrary to percentage requirements in the research and grant policies of the universities.

**iii.** Monitoring and Evaluation

- In all the four Universities, M&E was not carried out by the university management on external research grants for the period 2017/18-2019/20. 193 out of 348 (55.5%) sampled external grants were however monitored by the donors. For internal grants, only 222 grants under MUK RIF were monitored.

- It was noted that even where M&E was undertaken by donors, recommendations were not fully implemented by the Universities.
- 450 out of 512 Government funded Grants from MUK, Kyambogo and Busitema, representing 87.9% were not completed in time during the period under review. Similarly, 218 out of 350 (62.3%) Donor funded Grants from the 4 universities were not completed in time.

Key Recommendations

- The Ministry of Education and Sports should institute a committee with full representation from all public universities and supported with relevant legislation to collectively undertake strategic planning for university research in line with the National Development Plan and ensure adequate coordination between universities, follow-up of research activities, equitable allocation of resources and efficient utilization of academic staff on research.

- The NCHE should introduce a standard legal framework for evaluation of management of research activities in the universities. The Universities should then take the responsibility for mainstreaming the instituted framework into their management system. Regular audits of planned university research activities vis a vis expected outputs should be undertaken.

119

---

- The public universities should prioritize development of key research and grant management policies to guide the related processes. Benchmarking with leading universities in the region and at the continental level can be used to ease the process and ensure up-to-date policies with the changing environment.

- Government and related institutions should fast track the development of policies, strategies and guidelines to promote research, technology development and, uptake and management & commercialization of Intellectual Properties (IPs) as provided for in the NDP III.

- The public universities should have different Senate/Management committees for the different roles of governing graduate programs and students on one hand and research and innovations activities including grants management on the other hand. This would ensure adequate focus on strategic planning for research, management and follow-up of research activities at the university for timely achievement of university research objectives.

- The public universities should engage with MoPS, MoFPED and MoES for support to fill the key staffing gaps for grants management and ensure that the necessary key roles such as grants administration and M&E are undertaken.

- Government through the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should prioritise funding/grants for research in public universities to enable focus on research which is in line with university research agendas and national priorities.

- Government and related institutions should fast track the development of the national research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy making as provided for in the NDP III.
- The Universities’ management should institute Committees to follow up and review the implementation of recommendations on project or grant monitoring and Evaluation for improvement in the management of research grants in the University.

Overall Audit Conclusion

Despite the challenges noted in the management of Research Grants, Public Universities have, achieved some notable research outputs through research grants with outstanding innovations which included; production of an electric automobile, crop protection systems, farming systems for generating biofuel, improved water treatment, low cost MakaPads for the girl child, production of energy, and secure fertilizers all at Makerere University. Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) has also been able to produce traditional health care products at its Pharm-Biotechnology and traditional medicine centre, while Kyambogo produced an improved low-cost baby incubator and an online Academic Information Management System (AIMS), which is used by all public universities in the country.

There are still bottlenecks in management of Research Grants in Public Universities which have affected achievement of the university research objectives. These included; gaps in

120

---

the Institutional Framework for coordination of research grants, inadequate resource mobilization initiatives, inadequate implementation of research projects, lack of monitoring and evaluation framework, and absence of a joint organ to oversee and regulate research initiatives in public universities in the country.

It is hoped that when the recommendations in this report are implemented; the universities will effectively manage research grants, thus attaining the objectives of their research agendas.

7.5.  
Value for Money Audit on The Management Of MATIP-1 Markets by Municipalities

The Government of Uganda through MATIP-1 redeveloped and reconstructed seven (7) markets at a cost of USD.64.5 million to create a conducive trade environment and increase revenue collections for the municipalities. The seven (7) markets that were redeveloped were; Mpanga market, Hoima Central market, Mbale Central market, Jinja Central market, Gulu Central market, Wandegeya market and Lira central market.

This study assessed whether the municipalities had ensured that the redeveloped markets created a conducive trade environment and increased revenue collections for the municipalities.

The redevelopment of the seven (7) markets resulted in an increase in the number of vendors trading in these markets from 14,826 vendors in 2015 to 19,481 Vendors in 2021 which is a growth of 31%. In addition, market management structures comprising of staff of the Municipalities as well as vendor associations were established in all the markets and supported the Municipalities in their role of managing the markets through mobilizing vendors to participate in market activities such as trainings in running small scale businesses, market cleaning, and sensitizations in market security, trade order and hygiene.

Despite these achievements, the study noted areas that require attention if the management of these markets is to improve;

- The study revealed that the annual revenue budgets or targets of all the seven (7) markets were consistently below their revenue potential by 38%. Whereas the revenue potential for the markets was UGX.32.8Bn over the 6 years reviewed, the markets only budgeted to collect UGX.12.5Bn over the period. This was attributed to lack of a management information systems and the manner in which the municipalities develop the revenue budgets based on prior year collections instead of using actual market occupancy. Unrealistically low budgets imply that the revenue performance is likely to be below the market potential.

- Out of the budget of UGX.12.5Bn by these markets for the six-year period, only UGX.7.9Bn was collected representing a performance of 54%. This was due to lack of automated revenue management system, leaseholders who were not paying monthly market rents, unoccupied stalls and lockups, irregular subletting, and the failure to terminate tenancy of rent defaulters. Under collection of revenues has affected the

121

---

ability of these markets to meet their obligations which has resulted into accumulation of arrears totalling to UGX.1.41Bn in the seven (7) markets.

- Four (4) markets of Mbale, Gulu, Lira and Jinja were overcrowded with the vendor- occupancy exceeding the markets’ design capacity by 36% due to over allocation of market spaces, illegal traders and sub-lettees, inadequate enforcement by the municipality and design deficiencies such as poor lighting in some sections, and lack of accessibility. The overcrowding has caused congestion in the markets.

- The majority of vendors all the seven (7) markets were not trading in the established zones due to insufficient space in zones, allocation of spaces to traders outside their designated zones, rejection of the stalls by vendors, and weak enforcement of zoning. This has resulted in a disorganised market environment which continues to present challenges for customers and traders.

- All the seven (7) markets had failed to maintain adequate sanitation within the markets due to overcrowding of the markets, weaknesses in the supervision of the cleaning staff and cleaning contracts, insufficient number of garbage trucks, skips, bins, garbage banks and landfills. The poor sanitation makes the markets unsightly for the customers and poses health risks for both the traders and customers such as food contamination and air pollution.

- The market infrastructure was not well maintained for all the markets. There were cases of leaking roofs, walls with old peeling paint, cracked floors, non-functioning toilets, failed water pumps, un-serviced generators and firefighting equipment, and non-functioning CCTV security equipment. Inadequate maintenance of the market infrastructure was attributed to failure to prioritize this activity by the municipalities, and failure to set aside maintenance funds as recommended in the market maintenance guidelines. Failure to maintain infrastructure has resulted in accelerated deterioration of the newly constructed markets.

In order to address the gaps identified, the municipalities should roll out automated revenue management systems in all the markets, enforce terms of tenancy agreements in relation to sub-letting, invoicing and payment of rent, modify the market structures to allow for better lighting and improved access. The municipalities should also address the issue of illegal occupants, and develop guidelines to regulate sub-letting.

The municipalities should review the current markets layout to address the challenges of zoning, and overcrowding. In addition, there is need to enhance supervision of market cleaning and prioritise the maintenance of the market structures.

7.6.  
Prevention and Response to Incidents of Fire by Uganda Police Force.

Directorate of Fire Prevention and Emergency Rescue Services (DFPERS) is one of the directorates in the Uganda Police Force. Its major role is to enhance capacity for prevention of emergencies and delivery of rescue services in order to deliver on its functions of fire prevention, fire suppression and emergence rescue. The directorate operates eleven (11) fire stations in Kampala Metropolitan Area and thirty-four (34) others stations across the country.

122

---

This study assessed the extent to which DFPERS has put in place measures to prevent and respond to fire outbreaks. The Directorate of Fire and Rescue services has made notable achievements over its nine years of existence as illustrated below;

Following the creation of DFPERS in 2012 the number of fire stations in the country has increased by thirty-one (31) which has improved access to fire services. In addition, coordination with stakeholders in preventing and responding to fire by DFPERS has improved and a total of 4,131 have been responded to in the last four years thus saving lives and property. Despite the achievements registered, the audit identified the following areas that need to be addressed.

- The Directorate of Fire and Rescue Services (DFPERS) undertakes activities aimed at preventing the outbreak of fire and incidents that require emergency response. The study observed that the Directorate faced challenges in preventing the occurrence of fire. These include;

 DFPERS did not have fire and safety Act, regulations, and policies to aid the operations of the directorate in prevention. Because of this the Directorate was unable to effectively carry out risk assessment, sensitization of the public, inspection of buildings by DFPERS staff, and carry out post incident investigations as indicated below.

 DFPERS has not undertaken any comprehensive assessment of risks relating to occurrence of fire incidents in order to develop appropriate prevention and response measures/strategies to control fire outbreaks which has affected the directorate’s ability to develop appropriate fire prevention strategies.

 DFPERS undertook only 873 (29%) out of the planned 3,020 sensitisations in the past four (4) years. This has continued to expose buildings and their occupants to fire outbreaks and limited the capacity of citizens to prevent the occurrence of such incidents.

 DFPERS undertook only 527 (17%) out of the planned 3,080 inspections in the past four (4) years. This affects the level of compliance to fire standards which increases the probability of fire outbreaks which can lead to loss of life and damage to property.

The study also noted the following weaknesses on the side of the Fire department:

- DFPERS did not undertake post incident investigations to ascertain the cause, extent of damage or loss from the fires and lessons for prevention of re-occurrence of similar incidents on the 3,179 incidents of fire reported during the past three years due to lack of equipment and trained investigators and coordination with other government investigative bodies. This has resulted into non-conclusion of investigations hence continued public dissatisfaction on the way Uganda Police Force handles fire investigations.

123

---

- In addition to fire prevention, DFPERS responds to fire outbreaks to minimize the impact of fire on people’s lives and property. The Directorate faced challenges in responding to fire outbreaks due to limited number of fire stations, inadequate staff, lack of enough equipment and non-automation of operations to respond to fires as indicated below;

- DFPERS is currently operating forty-five (45) fire stations in thirty-eight (38) districts to respond to cases of fire outbreaks across the country which is only 27% coverage of the total number of districts in the country due to the high cost of opening and operating fire stations. This has resulted into DFPERS’ ineffectiveness in responding to incidents of fire across the country.

- DFPERS currently has 599 fire staff against an approved establishment of 1,081 staff representing staffing levels of 55% implying that the current fireman to population ratio in Uganda is 1:75,000 compared to the recommended international ratio of 1:2,000. The existing staff were also not well trained and lacked adequate accommodation.

- The equipment at the fire stations were inadequate in terms of quantity and functionality (not well maintained) to support effective response in the event of fire incidents. DFPERS had only 78 out of 232 equipment required to handle fire incidents representing 34% level of required equipment capacity. In addition, it was noted that firemen lacked adequate PPEs for use during fire response.

- The fire stations inspected were not automated and information was recorded in manual books there were also no computers and communication systems which affected the efficiency and coherence of DFPERS response in the event of fire outbreak.
- DFPERS coordinates with some stakeholders such as Local Governments, NWSC, DGAL, CIID, Hospital emergency units, Civil Aviation Authority and Uganda Red Cross Society however this coordination is informal and characterized by slow decision making which affects response time.

Key Recommendations

I advised DFPER to engage the Ministry of internal Affairs to develop a comprehensive fire and safety Act, policy and guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to streamline risk assessment, sensitisation, inspection and post incident investigations. In addition, DFPERS should enhance coordination mechanisms with internal and external players to support its operations particularly post incident investigations.

DFPERS should prioritize increasing coverage of fire stations to at least 50% of the districts and develop strategies to ensure the population fire man ratio of 1:75,000 is matched to internationally recommended ratio of 1: 2,000. In addition, UPF should undertake an assessment of the current accommodation needs with a view of developing strategies to address the current inadequacies in accommodation. UPF should prioritise the acquisition of equipment, PPEs and automation of the current communication and record management systems to ensure that there is an effective

response to fire incidents enhance on the operational efficiency during responses to incidents of fire outbreaks

7.7.  
Value for Money Audit on the Performance of the Performance of the Agriculture Cluster Development Project

Government has implemented the Agriculture Cluster Development Project (ACDP) with an overall objective of raising on-farm productivity, production and marketable volumes of selected agricultural commodities (Maize, Beans, Cassava, Rice, and Coffee) in twelve (12) clusters in fifty-seven (57) districts across the country. The project is funded through IDA Credit worth UGX.540Bn and farmer contribution of UGX.352.8Bn and implemented through the e-voucher management system.

The intervention has resulted into distribution of 60,124 tonnes of beans, maize, and rice and 49,871 bags of cassava planting materials to 245,510 farmers/beneficiaries by the agro-dealers between 2018/2019 and 2020/2021. The intervention has also resulted into increased the marketable volumes from 11.94MT to 33.28MT in the past three years.

Despite the achievements registered, the study identified areas that need to be addressed. The following key observations were noted;

- The project delayed to commence by 20 months’ due delays in obtaining the necessary approvals from cabinet and parliament (20 months) and delayed fulfilment of the project effectiveness conditions (26 months) which led to late implementation of project activities and service delivery.

- Despite the project achieving more than 70% in five (5) districts in training of Local Government Staff and farmers on system use and financial literacy, the project did not perform satisfactorily in twenty-three (23) districts where twenty-seven (27) trainings had been planned. As a consequence, a number of farmers were unable to transition from the first cropping cycle to the third cropping cycle.

- Out of the targeted 450,000 farmers, 204,490 (46%) farmers did not access inputs through the e-voucher system. With only one year left to the end of the project, the project may not achieve its intended objective.

- The inputs that were distributed to the farmers were not verified by UNBS because of absence of a streamlined quality control process. As a result, farmers reported cases where seeds did not germinate and fertilizers that “just hardened the soils” were distributed by the Agro-dealers. This has compromised the process of ensuring farmers get the best quality inputs since the department is limited in capacity to undertake this activity.

- The project did not achieve the intended targets in the three areas below in the three years of implementation.

125

---

o Only 207 Area Commodity Cooperative Enterprises (ACCEs) (69%) and 155 Rural Producer Organisations (RPOs) (5%) have been supported with value addition facilities out of the targeted 300 ACCEs and 3000 RPOs in the six-year project life span.  
o  
Out of 1,835 farmers in the cooperatives that received matching grants for the value addition facilities, only 585 farmers (31.9%) were enrolled on the e-voucher system which made it difficult for the project to reach its targeted 450,000 farmers.  
o The project had planned to rehabilitate a total of 2,827.7km planned road chokes however, only 228.1km (8%) had been rehabilitated representing 8% of the overall performance of the community access roads.

Government should ensure that for future projects of a similar nature; The necessary loan documentation is submitted by the implementing entities and loan appraisal unit at MoFPED to the approving authorities in time, trainings activities are undertaken in a timely manner, farmers are mobilized into village savings and lending associations to increase access to funding and reviewing the e-voucher subsidy rates in order to make them more affordable to farmers. The role of other partner participating agencies (in this case UNBS) regarding quality is clearly defined in future project designs.

In addition, MAAIF should ensure that evaluation of business proposals for funding of ACCEs and RPOs are done in a timely manner for the farmer groups to access funds. MAAIF should also enhance supervision in the rollout districts so that works on the road chocks are completed in the remaining project life span.

7.8. Follow up on the Value for Money Audit on the Compensation of Project Affected Persons under the Refinery Project by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development

The follow-up on the 2017 VFM audit on Compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) under the Refinery Project by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development found that MEMD had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations made at the time, resulting in improved RAP implementation.

Out of the 21 key audit recommendations made in the report of 2017, 12 (57%) were fully implemented and 4 (19%) were partially implemented. The status of implementation of 5 (24%) of the recommendations can only be verified in future projects through audit of subsequent RAPs.

Specifically, after the 2017 audit, MEMD had registered the following progress in RAP Implementation:

- All PAPs houses had been occupied by the respective owners;
- Electricity had been connected to all PAP houses;
- Four boreholes were constructed for use by the PAPs and the Host Community;
- Access roads constructed in the PAPs’ settlement area were completed and were motorable;
- Construction of the places of worship and a Police Post had been completed and the structures handed over to the respective authorities;
- Construction of the community centre and market stalls was on-going.

126

---

- MEMD had acquired land titles for the land occupied by the PAPs and was processing the transfer of the individual land titles into the names of the PAPs.

Some outstanding issues noted included the following: A few pending compensation payments mostly due to failure to trace the PAPs; failure by the contractor to remedy most defects identified during the 2017 audit; reports of conflicts owing to changing social dynamics as people adapt to living in congregated settlements; and long distance from the resettlement area to the boreholes. Finally, the PAPs also reported that MEMD and other responsible players rarely conduct visits to sensitise or update them on progress of pending outputs or to explain delays.

Further recommendations were then made with the aim of addressing the outstanding issues noted.

7.9.  
VFM Audit on the Implementation of the Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Services Improvement Project (URMCHSIP)

URMCHSIP is a USD 180 million project fully donor funded and was approved in August 2016 and is expected to close in December 2022. The target group comprises women of childbearing age, adolescents, and children under-five in all the one-hundred and thrty five (135) districts in Uganda. The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are to: (a) to scale up reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) services in the whole country; (b) scale-up birth and death registration (BDR) services; and (c) to strengthen disease outbreak preparedness and response.

The audit covered twelve (12) Districts benefiting from this project in the three financial years of 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20. Below are the key findings of the study;

**i.**  
Status of Implementation of the Project  
It was noted that out of the 22 project performance indicators considered, 13 (i.e. 60%) achieved their target for the FY 2019/20. The remaining 9 indicators (i.e. 40%) were below their 2019/20 target. Amongst the 9 are two indicators: the number of health facilities constructed and equipped, which are not reflecting any progress due to delays in implementation.

**ii.**  
The Results-Based Financing (RBF) Program  
Since January 2019 to date, the URMCHSIP has rolled out the RBF program to 1,316 health facilities in one-hundred and thirty-five (135) districts across the country in three phases. However, review of timing of RBF payments made by the Ministry of Health-to- health facilities revealed delayed payments ranging from 83 to 154 days after the prescribed deadline. Consequently, timely implementation of Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) activities at these facilities was adversely impacted. The delayed payments were partly attributed to the delayed verification of health facility outputs by the District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) which was further constrained by the reliance on manual processes.

**iii.**  
Procurement of Essential RMNCAH Medicines and Supplies  
The project intended to support the Ministry of Health (MoH), through National Medical Stores (NMS), to procure and distribute essential Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) commodities. However, there have been several delays in the procurement of these commodities under the project, leaving health facilities partly incapable of handling certain complications arising during delivery. This was partly attributed to failure by the MoH to retender certain procurements, there being no bidder that initially met the requirements.

**iv.**  
Birth and Death Notifications in Health Facilities  
There were delays in implementation of various activities by National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) especially (i) scaling up the electronic vital records system for birth registration through the supply of laptops, MiFi’s and internet data bundles to 285 HC IVs and High-volume Health centre IIIs. As a result, the project has made minimal improvement in capacity of these facilities to conduct birth and death notifications.

**v.**  
Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Activities  
The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function was found to be inadequate and this was partly attributed to the fact that there were no annual M&E work plans and the M&E specialist was only recruited in December 2019, two and a half years after the project had commenced.

Overall Audit Conclusion

The MoH is advised to continue working closely with the National Identification and Registration Authority, the District Local Governments, National Medical Stores, and the World Bank to address any capacity gaps and implementation delays that are derailing project performance. The MoH is also advised to liaise with MoFPED and other key stakeholders to guarantee the continuity of the interventions set up under this project especially the RBF Program, the increased supply of key RMNCAH medicines and supplies, the recruitment of health workers trained under URMCHSIP, so as maintain the gains made in the Health sector as a result of this project.

|---|---|---|  
|| AGRICULTURE SECTOR ||  
|            Delays in the implementation of some project activities were noted such as provision of E-Vouchers subsidies to beneficiaries in the 12 clusters, only a total of 208,827 of beneficiaries used E-Voucher out of the targeted 400,000 and only 18 road chokes have been worked on in the 7 pilot districts against the targeted 90. The project budgeted to receive UGX 361.7Bn from development partners but only received UGX 254.8Bn, representing a performance of 70% of the budget. Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX 4Bn as GOU counterpart funding but only received UGX 2.6Bn (66%) resulting in a shortfall of UGX 1.4Bn which is 34% of the budget. Out the releases of funds of UGX 254.8Bn, the project remained with unspent balance of UGX 99.1Bn representing an absorption level of 61%. I sampled 12 outputs with a total of 25 activities worth UGX.324.1Bn representing 90% of the total budget and noted that 8 outputs with 17 activities worth UGX 53.7Bn were not quantified to enable measurement of performance. Furthermore, of the 4 outputs with a total of (8) quantified activities worth UGX 80.14Bn assessed; 1 output with 1 activity representing 25% was fully implemented while 3 outputs with a total of 7 activities representing 75% were partially implemented. The budget for the financial year 2020/21 was approved on 13th August 2020 (2 months into the financial year). Project funds to the tune of UGX 3.5Bn were disbursed significantly late to the districts. National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) held only one meeting as opposed to two recommended in a year. Procurements for rehabilitation of identified and approved road chokes/work in the last 29 roll-out districts had not commenced by the time of audit despite MAAIF budgeting for the activity at UGX 90Bn. Shortcomings were observed with the E-Voucher Management Agency which included, frequent breakdown of the system, lesser enrolment of beneficiaries ie 64% of the target, only 44% of the project beneficiaries were trained in Financial Literacy and Input use, the system was at 78% of  requirement, system installation, configuration, optimisation and commissioning reports have not been submitted. its functional MAAIF budgeted UGX.104.9Bn to provide Electronic Voucher subsidies to 293,500 beneficiaries in 12 project clusters but only managed 118,933 (41%) beneficiaries. Farmers still had challenges in transacting using the system, managing farmer savings and use of inputs via the system. During the financial years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, 52,089 transactions were made by users who had never logged onto the system and were accessing inputs manually.

An analysis of E-Voucher Management Agency (EVMA) system revealed that 168,086 (99%) of the farmers that accessed inputs redeemed the inputs for only one cycle without transitioning to cycles 2 and 3, 2191 (1.3%) transitioned to cycle 2 without transitioning to cycle 3, while 47 (0.03%) transitioned to cycle 3. In the year 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, 347 farmers ordered inputs during the financial year at amounts that were in excess of the recommended threshold of UGX.1,350,000 worth UGX.186,792,644. |<|<|<|

|^| Unqualified |<|^|  
|^|^|<| activities were fully quantified. Further, out of the 14 outputs that were |  
|^|^|<| fully quantified, I observed that; 0ne (01) output with four (04) activities |  
|^|^|<| and expenditure worth UGX.0.547Bn was fully implemented; ten (10) |  
|^|^|<| outputs with forty-two (42) activities worth UGX.10.1Bn were partially |

|^|^|<| activities (21%) remained unimplemented. Three (03) outputs with four |  
|^|^|<| (04) activities were not implemented at all. |  
|^|^|<|  Assessment of achievement of services from implemented outputs |  
|^|^|<| revealed that 60 artificial inseminations (AI) Kits were purchased at |  
|^|^|<| UGX.0.26Bn and delivered to NAGRC in June; however, management had |

|      The entity had an approved strategic plan, however the plan had not been certified by NPA contrary to Regulation 26 (1) of the NPA (development of plans). All budgeted Donor revenue of UGX.0.783Bn for the financial year 2020/2021, was dully received representing performance of 100% of the target. There was a shortfall in releases amounting to UGX.0.172Bn representing 4.1% of the budget. Furthermore, the entity remained with unspent balance of UGX.0.00037Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. The entity received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.0.783bn which was not appropriated as part of the entity budget contrary to the law. 4 outputs with 8 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.324Bn were fully quantified while 5 outputs with 34 activities worth UGX.4.41Bn were 3 Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda.  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

|^|^|<| and, therefore not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. |  
|^|^|<|  I reviewed all 8 out-puts of the budget with a total of twenty one (21) |  
|^|^|<| activities and expenditure of UGX.8.46Bn and noted that two (2) outputs |  
|^|^|<| with two (2) activities and expenditure worth UGX.4.2Bn were fully |  
|^|^|<| quantified, four (4) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities and |  
|^|^|<| expenditure worth UGX.3.3Bn were insufficiently quantified that is out of |  
|^|^|<| the thirteen (13) activities, four (4) activities (30.8%) were quantified and |  
|^|^|<| nine (09) activities (69.2%) were not clearly quantified to enable |  
|^|^|<| assessment of performance while two (2) outputs with a total of six (6) |  
|^|^|<| activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.92Bn were not quantified at all. |  
|^|^|<| Further, of the 2 quantified outputs/activities assessed, 1 output with one |  
|^|^|<| (1) activity and expenditure of UGX.5.6Bn was fully implemented while 1 |  
|^|^|<| output with 1 activity worth UGX.3.6Bn was partially implemented. |  
|^|^|<|  Submission of performance reports for three quarters was made after the |  
|^|^|<| deadline dates and there was no evidence to confirm that the Accounting |  
|^|^|<| Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which are important in |  
|^|^|<| ensuring that the budget performs as expected. |  
|^|^|<|  It was noted that UGX.19.649Bn was budgeted to cater for the cotton |  
|^|^|<| marketing season 2020/21 out of which, UGX.15.154Bn was budgeted |  
|^|^|<| towards provision of planting seed and production inputs. Government |  
|^|^|<| was able to contribute only UGX.8.6Bn leaving the balance for the private |  
|^|^|<| partner intervention. This is an indication that government is relying more |  
|^|^|<| on the ginners to fund the cotton sector. Despite the intervention by the |  
|^|^|<| private sector, there were shortages in provision of inputs to farmers. 866 |  
|^|^|<| Mt of planting seed, 374.6 Mt of fertilizers and 2,260 spray pumps were |

|          The entity’s draft strategic plan had been aligned to the NDP-III at the time of audit and was awaiting certification from NPA due to delayed approval of the Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs). The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.4.625Bn but collected UGX.3.053Bn representing a performance of 66% of the target. There was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.11.216Bn representing 10.1%. Further, the entity remained with unspent balance of UGX.0.085Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. The entity received off-budget financing directly from development partners to a tune of UGX.49.77Bn out of which only UGX.38.19Bn was declared to the PSST and disclosed in the entity ministerial policy statement without a supplementary appropriation for the balance of UGX.11.58Bn. I sampled 8 outputs with 35 activities and expenditure of UGX.99.59Bn and noted that 7 outputs with 18 activities and expenditure worth UGX.45.070Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with 17 activities and expenditure worth UGX.54.52Bn was insufficiently quantified, of which 5 activities (29%) were quantified while 12 activities (71%) were not clearly quantified to enable measurement of performance. Further, I observed that out of the seven (7) outputs that were fully quantified, two (2) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX.5.186Bn were fully implemented while Five (5) outputs with thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.39.884Bn were partially implemented i.e. four (4) activities were fully implemented, eight (8) activities were partially implemented, while one (1) activity remained unimplemented. Submission of performance reports for all the quarters was made after the deadline dates. Fourteen (14) slow progressing competitive grant scheme (CGS) projects initiated in 2018/19 with funding of UGX.1.158Bn during the financial year 2020/2021 were still on-going despite expected completion date of June 2021. Civil works and Supplies Projects worth UGX.32,051,565,938 undertaken during the financial year were not yet handed over for use. Further, inspections of NARO facilities at institutes revealed poor road networks, broken down silos at the feed mill, non-functional water pump and abandoned works. There was failure to achieve the intended service delivery for the additional Civil Works at Rwebitaba ZARDI that costed UGX.418,584,880. This was due to lack of equipment in the laboratory.  Review of 9 sample procurements worth UGX.27,606,866,233 revealed an 5 National Agricultural Research Organization 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

|     average delay of 45 days in the procurement process due to late release of funds by MoFPED. The entity received Covid 19 supplementary budget of UGX.0.0134Bn for settlement of arrears which was all spent by the entity representing an absorption level of 100%. It was noted that this was inadequate for settlement of domestic arrears brought forward from the previous year 2019/20 given leaving a deficit of UGX1.69Bn (98%). Domestic arrears increased from UGX.1.72Bn in the previous year to UGX.2.875Bn in the year under review, an increase of 67%. The arrears remained unsettled at the close of the year. Further, NARO did not budget for domestic arrears amounting to UGX.1.687Bn during the year as a paltry provision of only UGX.0.033Bn was budgeted to settle arrears of UGX.1.72Bn. A review of NARO’s land portfolio revealed that the entity had surveyed 31 pieces of land with total coverage of 4097.20364 Hectares, however it was noted that 8 pieces (3172.937 Hectares) were titled, 20 pieces of land (706.75454 Hectares) were at deed plan stage and 3 pieces of land (217.5121 Hectares) were still at survey report stage. Further, 17 parcels of land located in NaFIRRI-Jinja, Bulindi-Kibaale district, NaLIRRI- Tororo, Namayingo, Nyakyesasa, Ngetta- Kitgum and Rwebitaba-Fort-portal still had cases of encroachement by both private and public developers. A review of the NARO staff establishment revealed that out of the approved staff number of 995 employees, 851 positions have been filled leaving a staffing gap of 144 (14.5%) staff which indicates a further reduction in staff by about 2.5% compared to the previous financial year. |<|<|<|

The Project budgeted to receive IFAD funds to a tune of UGX.39.87bn, out of which UGX.25.584bn was available representing a performance of 64% of the budget. Further, there was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.0.035Bn representing 0.46% of the budgeted UGX.7.597Bn. Out of the total available funding of UGX.35.528Bn during the financial year, UGX.28.415Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.7.113Bn representing an absorption level of 80%. I sampled Six (6) outputs with a total of eighty one (81) activities and expenditure of UGX.21.6231Bn and noted that all six (6) outputs with 81 activities were fully quantified to enable assessment of performance. Further, assessment of the implementation of all Six (6) outputs revealed that; all six (6) outputs with eighty one (81) activities were partially implemented i.e. out of the eighty one (81) activities, thirty two (32) activities (40%) were fully implemented; thirty (30) activities (37.5%) were partially implemented, while nineteen (19) activities (12.5%) remained unimplemented. Two (2) contracts worth UGX.12.397Bn in relation to construction of landing sites were cancelled due to delayed implementation of projects beyond 12 months from the initial intended completion date. I noted delayed titling of 883.92 hectares of the acquired nucleus estate Land exposing it to risks of encroachment by individuals. Review of four (4) sample procurements worth UGX.1.47Bn revealed an average delay of 140 days in the procurement process majorly as a result of delayed approval process by IFAD, contracts committee and Solicitor General. 7  National Oil Palm Project 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

Further, assessment of the implementation of the two (2) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of three (03) activities revealed that none was fully implemented. Assessment of one partially implemented output revealed that out of 3,010,000 hand hoes, only 2,500,000 hand hoes were procured and distributed to the Northern parts of the country instead of the planned vulnerable rural small holder farming households across the country. Submission of performance reports for all quarters was made after the deadline dates. Furthermore, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports. NAADS incurred huge LC charges to a tune of UGX.1.053Bn as a result of opened LCs worth UGX.71.25Bn for contracts that failed to deliver within the year.

Review of the Kasese industrial park Agri-LED intervention worth UGX.3.9Bn revealed allocation of land to a bus company contrary to the set objectives and delayed payment of NWSC to connect piped water. Review of the sugarcane production project implementation with investments of UGX.85Bn revealed shortcomings i.e.lack of feasibility assessment, lack of accruing benefits to the beneficiaries, weaknesses in the MoU signed with beneficiaries, limited information on members of the cooperatives, delays liquidated damages, and stalled activities. in contract completions, pending I noted failure to enter into MOU’s with beneficiaries of milk coolers contrary to the selection criteria of the standing orders of procedure for operation wealth creation. There was lack of clearly identified beneficiaries from the start in the transportation and distribution of hoes intervention, lack of MOU’s with delegated DLGs on distribution modalities and nugatory storage costs.

- Submission of performance reports for three quarters was made after the deadline dates. Furthermore, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports.

- Review of the distribution lists (form Bs) attached to the accountabilities for coffee seedlings supplied revealed that deliveries to a tune of UGX.0.213Bn were made either out of season or towards season end thus rendering the survival of the inputs nearly impossible.

- Fertilizers worth UGX.2.25Bn distributed to the cooperatives were unacknowledged by the intended coffee farmers. The form F3’s where the actual farmers who received the fertilisers were supposed to have acknowledged had not yet been received and verified by management and neither had the cooperatives returned the empty fertiliser bags and filled in form F4’s.

- 65,445 and 1880 bags of fertilisers for the western and Elgon region respectively had not yet been distributed at the time of inspection in September 2021 contrary to section 7 (a) of the fertiliser distribution guidelines that required application of fertilisers to only be done in the rainy season.

- Field inspection of the procured fertilizers and materials to support the establishment of CWDR nurseries revealed several anomalies i.e. bad warehousing storage (stacked high on the floor, instead of pallets), lack of aeration and non-adherence to first in first out (FIFO) policy. Further, the nurseries for CWDR had not been setup and materials were simply kept in stores by the beneficiaries and some had started using the implements such as hoes, pangas, wheel burrows; mother gardens were poorly maintained and no labels of the lines had been added to the mother gardens.

- UCDA had a Covid 19 arrears supplementary budget of UGX.73Bn all of which was warranted and absorbed 100%. Review of utilisation revealed doubtful payments, duplicated arrears on verified list and witting down of invoice amounts without supplier consent which exposes the entity to litigation

- Domestic arrears showed a movement in arrears from UGX.120,383,249,500 in the previous year to UGX.23,036,904,150 by the close of the financial year 2019/20, representing a decrease of 80.8%. Out of this, amount UGX.16,699,179,350 was incurred during the year under review.

- A total of UGX.80,373,239,334 (43.1% of the approved budget) was provided for settlement of domestic arrears, however, arrears worth UGX.125,407,367,170 were paid resulting in settlement of prior year domestic arrears worth UGX.45,034,127,836.

- Review of the procurement function revealed several shortcomings such as delays in the procurement process with an average delay period of 2 and a half months, failure to deliver within contractual timelines, un- deducted liquidated damages, inconsistent liquidated damages clauses and deviation from Ministry of Works specifications for vehicle

I assessed the extent of service delivery and noted that only 11% of the planned 1,712,880 citizens were registered during the year, while only 30% of the planned 2,000,000 National IDs were issued. I assessed the progress on registration of births and deaths and observed that NIRA registered 90% of the planned 960,000 births and only 1.3% of the 960,000 deaths. A review of the progress of registering citizens indicated that as of December 2021, 29,713,029 applications, or 69% of all Ugandans, had applied to NIRA for registration. Of these, only 25,557,448 or 86% of the applicants had been registered, and only 16,258,521 (63.6%) have been issued with National Identity cards. Only 16.3 million cards out of the over 19 million national identity cards so far printed have been claimed, leaving over 2.7 million cards unissued or unclaimed. At the time of audit (December 2021), the Authority had over 4.3 million applications yet to be processed. Of these, 3.2 million applications were still being processed, while 1.1 million applications have been rejected. NIRA plans to register at least 28,000 aliens annually and issue them with the relevant identification cards.

|^|^|<| the following: |  
|^|^|<|  The Corporation had an operating margin of 6.8% which is below the |  
|^|^|<| recommended 15%. This implies that the subsidiary has a lower |

|^|^|<| review up from profits of UGX.0.661bn realized in the previous year (a |  
|^|^|<| rise of 211.5%). The Corporation had positive retained earnings of |  
|^|^|<| UGX.0.724bn as at the end of the financial year. This will enable the |  
|^|^|<| corporation to meet future contingencies or investments in growth. |  
|^|^|<|  The return on assets for the Corporation increased to 19.1% from 13.1% |  
|^|^|<| recorded in the previous year which is generally considered good given |  
|^|^|<| that it is over 5%. |  
|^|^|<|  The Corporation had a current ratio of 2.7 for the year under review |  
|^|^|<| which was above the desirable ratio of 1.5 implying that the Corporation |  
|^|^|<| is not efficiently using its current assets. |  
|^|^|<|  The Corporation had a debt ratio of 35% as at the end of the financial |  
|^|^|<| year compared to 2.8% in the previous year implying that the majority of |  
|^|^|<| the Corporation assets are financed by debt. |

NEC AGRO SMC LTD has an operating margin of 8.5% which is below the desirable 15%. This implies that the subsidiary has a lower proportion of revenues covering expenses rather than profits or income. The Corporation had a current ratio of 11.4 for the year under review which was way above the desirable ratio of 1.5.

The Corporation made profits of UGX.32,789,541 after tax in the year under review up from profits of UGX.30,230,727 realized in the previous year representing a rise in profits of 8.5%. However the Corporation had negative retained earnings of UGX.1,441,914,445 as at the end of the financial year which may affect the entity’s ability to meet future contingencies or investments in growth. The corporation posted a return on assets of only 0.4% down from 0.56% posted in the previous year, representing a reduction in ROA of 28.6%. This implies that the Corporation is not making enough income from the use of its assets. The Corporation had a current ratio of 2,123 for the year under review which was far above the desirable range of 1.5 – 2.0.

I observed that procurements are normally undertaken as and when the aircrafts breakdown and as such did not follow the formal procurement procedures. UACC signed a contract on 20th April, 2021 with National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) for construction of the UACC HQ offices for a sum of UGX.1.097Bn and the expected project completion date was 19th October, 2021. I observed that unsecured advances of UGX.1.04Bn (95%) of the contract sum had been paid to NEC by closure of the financial year 30th June 2021. Audit inspection carried out on 18th October, 2021 observed that construction works were behind schedule. UACC to-date does not have an operating Aircraft to do business since most of them had been grounded or not operational under different circumstances.

|       I noted that the Commission did not have an approved strategic plan that was aligned to NDP III by the time of audit. The draft plan prepared by the entity had not been certified by NPA. The Commission collected only 0.03% of its NTR target for the year and had a shortfall in government funding of 0.04Bn which is 0.75% of the budget. The Commission absorbed all the funds that were released. Out of the five (5) out-puts assessed, one (1) output with 0.115 Bn was fully quantified, while four (4) outputs with 4.01Bn were insufficiently quantified. The one (1) output that was fully quantified was partially implemented. The Commission neither prepared annual budget monitoring plans nor submitted quarterly budget monitoring reports. The Commission also failed to submit all its quarterly budget performance reports in time. The Commission failed to coordinate the automation of revenue management systems. There are currently four (4) revenue management systems used by various Local Governments which are implemented in a disjointed and uncoordinated manner. This has resulted in duplication of activities associated with running these systems thus affecting service delivery. The Commission received UGX.182,000,000 as budget support to undertake physical decentralization and service delivery. However only UGX.31,241,000 was absorbed by the Commission which significantly 3\. Local Government Finance Commission  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, and Q3, after the deadline given for submission The Statement of Stores and Other Assets (physical assets) as at the end of the financial year 2019/2020 revealed that additions during the year relating to non-residential buildings were disclosed as UGX.149,778,932, however, the Embassy procured items amounting to UGX.333,509,897 implying that items worth UGX.183,730,965 were not disclosed in this statement thus understating the Statement of Stores and Other Assets (physical assets). The Embassy had an approved budget of UGX.196,000,000 for procurement of furniture and fixtures but a sum of UGX.333,509,897 on this item resulting into an excess expenditure of UGX.137,509,987. The Embassy procured furniture and fittings for furnishing six residencies and a Chancery worth RUB.6,795,232 (equivalent to UGX.333,509,897) but were not recorded in the Embassy asset register as well as the Board of Survey report, direct procurement method was used without justification, procurements did not undergo any evaluation of bids, contracts committee was not involved during the procurement process and contract managers were not appointed for all the procurements. The Assets Register maintained by the Embassy was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions as it lacked details of date of purchase, cost of purchase, maintenance cost, asset code and estimated useful life. The Embassy spent RUB.1,052,189.97 and EURO.370.37 (approximately UGX.53,187,249) on refunds for medical expenses to its officers contrary to the requirements of Section M (m-a) (14) of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.

- The Embassy had planned to refurbish the official residence and UGX.300,000,000 was released by the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) through a supplementary budget for the purpose. However, the refurbishment did not take place and UGX.190,000,000 was returned to the consolidated fund as required by Section 17(2) of the PFMA 2015 while UGX.110,000,000 was diverted.

- Payments to the tune of DKK.171,063.61 (equivalent to UGX.95,910,234) had contradicting supporting documentation attached, payments were unbudgeted for or were incurred for activities which are not the responsibility of the Embassy.

- Salary payments to locally recruited staff at the Mission to the tune of DKK.141,940.00 (equivalent to UGX.79,581,500) were made to two staff but no contract appointment letters were availed to justify them.

- Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.1,570,000,000 for the financial year 2019/2020 only UGX.33,780,671 was collected representing performance of 2.15% of the target. The entity did not remit the collected amounts to the consolidated fund by the 31st July following the closure of the financial year contrary to the requirements of the PFMA.

- Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.5.642Bn, UGX.5.152Bn was spent by the Mission resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.490Bn representing an absorption level of 91.3%. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was not returned to the consolidated fund account by the 31st July 2020 contrary to the law.

- Out of the 5 outputs with a total of 9 activities and expenditure of UGX.5.152Bn, 2 outputs with a total of 2 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.467bn were fully quantified, 2 outputs with a total of 5 activities and expenditure worth UGX.4.828Bn were insufficiently quantified while 1 output with a total of 2 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.372Bn was not quantified at all. Of the quantified outputs, 1 output with 1 activity worth UGX.0.167bn was fully implemented while 1 output with 1 activity worth UGX.0.300bn was partially implemented.

- The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. In addition, performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 were submitted after the deadline for submission.

- I observed that the Head of Mission and the Accounting Officer were absent from the station from March 2020 to June 2020, a period that is critical for preparation and finalisation of the Embassy financial statements. The two officers were under lock-down restrictions in Uganda due to onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition the Finance Attaché was not in office for most of the financial year. This negatively impacted on the operations of the Mission during that period.

- During the month of June 2020, a sum of DKK.152,700 (equivalent to UGX.85,970,100) was paid to Embassy staff for claims for trips that had been undertaken in January and February 2020. I observed that the payments were not adequately supported to justify that the trips were undertaken.

- An officer of the Embassy was paid Foreign Service Allowance for the months of November and December amounting to DKK.23,375.85 (equivalent to UGX.13,160,604) and education allowance amounting to

| An assessment to establish if there has been service delivery from a sample of outputs that were implemented revealed that purchase of motor vehicles and other transport equipment was undertaken but not fully used for the purpose while the Commission continues to pay rent after fully acquiring warehousing space. I noted inconsistencies in the reported performance where all vehicles were reported as received which was not true while reported balances in the financial statements were inconsistent with those reported in the performance reports. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.4,023,217,397 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I noted that the Commission has been accumulating arrears in past three years and during the year 2020/2021, UGX.6.959Bn in arrears remained outstanding. The Commission has in the past won cases and was awarded costs to the tune of UGX.336,880,920 but management has not collected these receivables. The Commission procured Biometric Voter Verification Kit and services for the 2021 general election at a cost of UGX.82,894,881,252 and I observed that available kits were not considered while the services were not fully delivered. The Commission entered into two contract agreements with a company to supply 10 double cabin pick-up vehicles at a cost of UGX.1,564,563,350 and 40 double cabin pick-up vehicles at UGX.7,013,387,920 for nomination of the Presidential candidates but by the time of audit, whereas the Commission had paid the full amount, only 32 double cabin vehicles out of the total 50 vehicles procured had been delivered leaving a balance of 18 vehicles. The Commission procured for printing of ballot papers for 2021 general elections at a total cost of UGX.83.855Bn. 248 out of expected 448 pallets were delivered but the Commission had assembled vehicles to carry the entire load which rendered the vehicles redundant and this caused a loss to the Commission in form of hire fees, fuel and allowances. The Commission was required to vacate their current premises by 30th June, 2021 and was subsequently compensated with UGX.22.14Bn by the Uganda National Roads Authority which was transferred to the consolidated fund as non-tax revenue. As a result of the continued delay to implement this critical activity of finding a new home, the Commission is already incurring losses on property acquired and is also likely to cause government to incur litigation costs through UNRA’s failure to completely hand over the construction sites for roads to the contractor. The Commission contracted two law firms for provision of legal services for Presidential petition at a cost of UGX.3,748,550,000 which had been budgeted at UGX.800Million resulting into payment of UGX.2,948,550,000 over and above the budget. Even though the planning for the elections started 3 years back, the procurement was treated as an emergency and there was no basis for the fees charged or detail of how the Commission came up with the market price for the service.           |<|<|

The Ministry did not forecast the NTR to be collected during the year. However, a total of UGX6,995,230,920 was collected during the year. Out of the total warrants of UGX. 1,280.322Bn received during the financial year, UGX. 1,067.967Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 212.355Bn representing absorption level of 83.4% The Ministry did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: bridge inventory Data for BMS not collected; bridge management System (BMS) Software not procured, and; upgrading to Bitumen Standard Sebbowa road. The Ministry had receivables worth UGX.1,570,776,843 out of which those worth UGX.623,855,947 were outstanding at the end of the previous year. There is likelihood of failure to recover the receivables that have been outstanding for over a year Twenty-one (21) units of district road equipment had been lying in the workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair. The equipment included: thirteen (13) motor graders of different models; four (4) bulldozers; One (1) pickup; two (2) dump trucks, and one (1) wheel loader. Three (3) out of the nine (9) training aircrafts of the East African Civil Aviation Academy in Soroti were grounded due to non-repair and maintenance. The aircrafts were (registration numbers): 5X-RWE grounded due to a defective fuel injector pump; 5X-UAN grounded for mandatory structural modification and 5X -YKM grounded for a propeller overhaul. I observed delayed compensation of PAPs for the development of the New Kampala Port in Bukasa. The valuation report for 2,378 PAPs with a total compensation sum of UGX 29.2 billion was approved by the Chief Government Valuer in October 2018. A total of 1,253 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.19.5 billion had been paid by 30th June 2021. As a result a total of 1,125 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.9.7 billion have remained unpaid for about three years.

The contract provided that the works were to be completed by 01/07/2020. However, by the time of the audit in October 2021, one year and four months after planned completion date, the project works were not yet completed. The acquisition of land for the Right of Way (RoW) for the SGR project has been delayed. The project plan was to acquire 5200 acres of land free of encumbrances at an estimated cost of UGX 534,600,000,000 for the construction of Kampala – Malaba SGR route by October 2016. However, only 1,295.98 (24.9%) acres of land had been acquired at a cost of UGX.95,361,767,388 (18%) as of September 2021.            Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) Unqualified 1 Opinion |<|<|<|

|         I noted that the entity had prepared a strategic plan. However, this had not been approved by NPA at the end of the year under review. URF did not forecast the NTR to be collected during the year. However, the Fund collected a total of UGX7,078,800 during the year. Out of the total warrants of UGX. 506.507bn received during the financial year, UGX. 506.296 Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.211Bn representing an absorption level of 99.96%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA The Authority did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Production of quarterly reports on the status and functionality of District Road Committees; Recruitment and substantive appointment of staff and; Review and calibration of the funds allocation formula. The Fund did not collect the funds provided for under section 21 of the URF Act 2008 which mandates the Fund on recommendation by the URF Board to charge road user charges which include fuel levies, international transit fees from vehicles entering the country, road license fees, axle load fees, and bridge and road toll fees. I noted that the fund allocation formula was last reviewed by the Secretariat in 2019. In addition, during the year, the formula was not reviewed to provide for current situations such as budget cuts and Covid- 19 pandemic effects which led to disproportionate transfers to designated agencies. Procurements worth UGX 642,234,236 had delays ranging between 1 and 93 working days. For example; the contract for provision of Motor Vehicle maintenance services under framework contract was delayed by 93 days and the contract for supply, delivery and installation of I-pads for URF Board members was delayed by 15 days. There were inadequate monitoring Designated Agencies.

There was no evidence that the reallocations/diversions of such magnitude were authorized either by Parliament or the relevant funders. |  
|^| Qualified |<|^|  
|^|^|<|  The Authority over-budgeted funds for salaries. The over budgeted funds |  
|^|^|<| were diverted from the salary provisions to capital development activities. |  
|^|^|<| The diversion of funds led to a misreporting in the financial statements of |  
|^|^|<| UGX 4,689,704,394. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that the UNRA did not have an approved five year vote strategic |  
|^|^|<| plan by NPA to facilitate operationalization of the NDP III infrastructure |  
|^|^|<| sector priorities during the first year of NDP implementation. |  
|^|^|<|  UNRA did not forecast the NTR to be collected during the year. In |  
|^|^|<| addition, there was no documented revenue collection plan detailing how |  
|^|^|<| much to be collected and revenue sources. However, UNRA collected a |  
|^|^|<| total of UGX3,894,306,295 during the year. I also noted that MoFPED set |  
|^|^|<| a target of UGX10.76bn to be collected in NTR by UNRA during the year |  
|^|^|<| under review; there was no reconciliation between the Ministry of |  
|^|^|<| Finance, Planning and Economic and Uganda National Roads Authority on |  
|^|^|<| the planned revenue to be collected. |  
|^|^|<|  The UNRA budgeted to receive UGX. 3,918.151 bn out of which UGX. |  
|^|^|<| 3,787.289 bn was availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX 130.863 bn, |  
|^|^|<| which is 3.34% of the budget. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that UNRA did not have unit cost estimates at activity level to |  
|^|^|<| provide a link between inputs, processes, outputs and intermediate |  
|^|^|<| outcomes realized during the year. |  
|^|^|<|  The Authority failed to implement several planned activities during the |  
|^|^|<| year. Examples include: construction of 10 km - equivalents along |  
|^|^|<| package 6 (Karugutu - Ntoroko and Kabwoya - Buhuka); construction of |  
|^|^|<| 10 km - equivalents along Rwenkunye- Apac- Lira-Acholibur road; civil |  
|^|^|<| works for the construction of UNRA offices; works for construction of |  
|^|^|<| Kamdini Weigh station, and; construction of Wanseko Ferry landing site. |  
|^|^|<|  Contrary to the Land Acquisition Act CAP 226, I noted that for the Hoima- |  
|^|^|<| Butiaba-Wanseko Road Project, UNRA did not submit a request to the |  
|^|^|<| Ministry of Lands to declare the land identified for the road project as |  
|^|^|<| land of interest. |  
|^|^|<|  I observed delays in payments for Project Affected Persons on two roads |  
|^|^|<| audited. Out of the sampled 221 PAPs for Hoima-Wanseko, 136 PAPs with |  
|^|^|<| properties worth UGX 6.2 billion were paid after the specified six-month |  
|^|^|<| period. For KJE project, out of 234 PAPs sampled, 229 PAPs with |  
|^|^|<| properties worth UGX 70.2 billion were paid after the specified six-month |  
|^|^|<| period. |  
|^|^|<|  According to the Kampala-Jinja Expressway Resettlement Action Plan |  
|^|^|<| Implementation Progress report of May 2020 – August 2021, a total of |  
|^|^|<| 219 PAPs required physical resettlement. It was noted by the time of the |  
|^|^|<| audit that 13 resettlement sites had been identified and these were being |  
|^|^|<| assessed for suitability. However, although the process of engaging a |  
|^|^|<| provider to support UNRA in developing housing options and building the |

|^|<|<| December 2020, no contractor had been procured for this purpose by the |  
|^|<|<| time of the audit in September 2021, implying a delay of over 9 months. |  
|^|<|<|  Significant delays in subdivision, demarcation and transfer of titles for |  
|^|<|<| fully acquired plots were observed on the Kampala-Jinja Expressway and |  
|^|<|<| Hoima-Wanseko Road projects. |  
|^|<|<|  The Authority had an outstanding balance of UGX 215,059,225,419 in |

|^|<|<| 73,885,957,262 (52.3%) from the previous year’s amount of UGX |  
|^|<|<| 141,173,268,157. It was observed that the bulk of this amount is |  
|^|<|<| comprised of unpaid certificates to contractors which yield interest due to |  
|^|<|<| delayed payments. |  
|^|<|<|  Authority made payments amounting to UGX 17,078,565,465 as a result |  
|^|<|<| of penalties for the court cases and interest on delayed payments of |  
|^|<|<| advances and IPCs invoices from various projects. This is a loss to |  
|^|<|<| Government. |  
|^|<|<|  The value of the Authority’s infrastructure assets at the end of the |  
|^|<|<| financial year was disclosed as UGX10,417,198,881,566. However, |  
|^|<|<| contrary to the policy requirement to revalue the assets every three |  
|^|<|<| years, I was not availed with any valuation report for the infrastructure |  
|^|<|<| assets to confirm that the assets had ever been valued. |  
|^|<|<|  35 road projects with a total contract value of USD.398,427,063.99 and |

|^|<|<| registered proprietors. |  
|         I noted that the entity had prepared a strategic plan. However, this had not been approved by NPA at the end of the year under review. UCAA budgeted to collect internal revenue of UGX 293bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX 114.991bn was collected, representing a performance of 39.2% of the target. UCAA absorbed all its revenue collected, and accrued expenditure in unpaid bills that is. its actual expenditure was more than the revenue. The Authority did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Capital projects for Regional Airports, KOICA Counterpart funding, and procurement of a fleet management system, updating the master plan and constructing the ground surface car park. There was an increase in trade and other receivables of UGX. 12,279,645,000 (equivalent to 25%) from UGX. 48,854,526,000 to UGX.61,134,171,000. The delayed collection of the receivables may lead to bad debts. Management reported an  trade payables of UGX 21,763,762,000 (equivalent to 47.9%) from UGX 45,470,736,000 to UGX 67,234,498,000. increase in The Authority had accumulated receivables of up to UGX 96,569,511,580 in the FY 2019/20 due from Government Agencies. In the year under review, there was no follow up of this debt to the Government agencies, and no amounts were cleared.

Along with the lack of potential to cover loan interest, the Authority had a significant long term liabilities portfolio on its balance sheet, which majorly comprised of the loan from Exim Bank of China. Prime Media’s contract ended with a debt of UGX 1,131,017,128 which was unpaid for the year before the expiry of the contract. UCAA has multiple systems operating in different departments which are tailored for the operations in the respective departments. A review of these systems revealed that some were not functional, not interfaced with other complementary system(s) and/or some of their modules were not working. Further, the IT Point of Sale System bought for tracking of revenue from concessionaire shops was out of date. The Exim Bank loan terms to UCAA were renegotiated and this was to be formalized into an addendum agreement, to ensure that they are manageable. However, the addendum to the contract terms had still not been made by the time of this audit. |<|<|<|

| 6 | Uganda National Airlines Company Ltd (UNACL). 2020/21 Qualified Opinion |<|  UGX 8,716,398,000 was disclosed as the value of the inventories in the statement of financial position. However there was no evidence that Management carried out end of year stock taking to get actual values of inventories. In addition, there were no stores ledgers for engineering stores, and although the general stores had manual ledgers, the ledgers were not capturing Goods Received Note reference numbers (GRN) |  
|^|^|<| against the receipts in the ledgers as a reference of the goods received. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that the entity did not have a strategic / business plan aligned to |  
|^|^|<| NDPIII. |  
|^|^|<|  UNACL budgeted to collect internal revenue of UGX 304.6bn during the |  
|^|^|<| year under review. Out of this, only UGX 48.6bn was collected, |  
|^|^|<| representing a performance of 16% of the target. |  
|^|^|<|  The Company did not implement some of its planned activities during the |  
|^|^|<| year. Examples include: Procurement of spare parts for the Airbus fleet; |  
|^|^|<| supporting 32 pilots for A330-800 neo type training, and; supporting 60 |  
|^|^|<| pilots in simulator training. |  
|^|^|<|  The company had payables totaling UGX.47,032,043,000. All the |  
|^|^|<| outstanding invoices were payable to UCAA. Out of the amount, payables |  
|^|^|<| totaling UGX 16,065,309,363 had been due for more than 6 months. |  
|^|^|<|  UGX 1,127,484,315 as the value of Property Plant and Equipment In the |  
|^|^|<| statement of financial position and the corresponding note (Note 12) as |  
|^|^|<| at the close of the financial year. However, it was noted that assets were |  
|^|^|<| not engraved to give them an identification number for easy of |  
|^|^|<| identification. It was also noted that the assets could not be traced in the |  
|^|^|<| assets’ register due to lack of identification numbers. |  
|^|^|<|  I carried out financial analysis of UNACL financial performance and |  
|^|^|<| observed that the Company had made losses for the year 2019/2020 and |  
|^|^|<| 2020/2021 amounting to UGX102.442bn and UGX164.573bn respectively. |  
|^|^|<| On review of the operating margin, I observed that the costs before |  
|^|^|<| considering interest and taxes exceeded company revenues for the two |  
|^|^|<| years. I also observed that due to the losses incurred, the Company |  
|^|^|<| generated negative return on assets of 12.2% for the year 2019/2020 |  
|^|^|<| and 13.1% for the year 2020/2021. The Company’s revenue is still far |

- A purchase Order was made for the supply of inflight equipment at a price of USD 25,694.46 (VAT Exclusive) without the approval of the Contracts Committee.

- Two companies submitted bids for specialized motorized equipment used in ground handling of aircraft. The companies failed the preliminary stage (compliance), however, the Evaluation Committee did not cancel the evaluation process. The contract manager was not appointed and the delivery was not witnessed.

- USD 8,620.7 vide payment voucher No PV07/21/072 was paid to DAS Air as rent for the month of April 2021. Further to the above a review of invoices revealed that DAS Air had billed Uganda Airlines a total of USD 43,103.5 for unpaid ground rent. However, Uganda Airlines had not made any tenancy agreement with the DAS air, and there was no handover report from Uganda Airlines to DAS Air.

- UGX 103,532,800 (USD 28,000) was paid to the supplier vide payment voucher No. PV09/20/025 dated 4/9/2020. The vehicle was purchased through direct procurement without proper justification.

- Uganda National Airlines Limited made a contract agreement with M/s Ninesun Manufacturing Limited for supply of inflight service equipment for airbus at a contract amount of USD 319,226.86. The items were said to have been delivered to DAS Air. I was not provided with evidence that the items were actually delivered, witnessed for quality and quantity and handed over to DAS Air stores.

- UNACL concluded the procurement of a contractor for the provision of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software solution at a contract sum of USD 1,066,910 (VAT Exclusive) as well as the provision of an integrated Passenger Service System at a contract sum of USD 1,234,441 (VAT Exclusive). The procurements were conducted and finalized without seeking the necessary approvals from NITA-U.

- The company issued a purchase order on 27/01/2021 to M/s Stelia Aerospace for Supply of critical spare parts for business class seats for A330-800 NEO at a price of USD 146,230.72. I was however not provided with the contract for the supply.

- From the 20 procurements sampled, I noted that neither was there Accounting Officer’s appointments of contract managers nor were there contract management files. The procurements were made in different currencies amounting to (for each currency); Euro 212,050.67, Kenya Shillings 12,253,905.74, USD 109,803,962.54 and UGX 347,242,879.

- The Company did not have a Board approved staff structure and establishment to assess staff recruitment needs and staffing status, and did not have approved staff salary grades. This affected proper planning and budgeting for staff costs. As a consequence, the Company incurred excess expenditure of UGX 4,919,238,464 (USD 1,333,008) on salaries and staff expenses.

- There has been delayed conclusion of suspension cases. On 21st of April 2021, some HoDs were suspended for a period of 3 months (effective 29th April, 2021) to enable the appointed committee to investigate and report on stated allegations. Review of the staff files revealed that there were no committee resolutions on the cases and as a result Management extended the suspension on 20th August 2021 for another 3 months.

Since the ferries have been out of use under water for a long time without retrieval and cannot be disposed of while under water, it cannot be determined whether they still hold the value indicated to the Corporation. figure included a The Corporation had GoU  to UGX.22,067,482,000 at the beginning and end of the year under review. Out of this loan amount, loans totalling UGX.16,511,595,000 (other than the Spanish Government loan) were not supported and did not show any movement over the last four (4) years. equipment loans amounting Interest arising from loans that was yet to be cleared by URC amounted to UGX.9,511,880,000. However, this balance has been outstanding over several years without any movement. The status quo still remained the same by the close of the year under review. This interest payable was not supported by any original documentation. Trade and Other Payables increased from UGX.17,937,602,000 at the beginning of the year to UGX.21,513,931,000 at the close of the year. Out of the amount, trade and other payables worth UGX.9,753,781,407 lacked supporting documents such as LPOs, contracts, inward invoices, claims and demand notes. The Corporation had Trade and Other  of UGX.75,637,890,000 as at 30th June 2021. The figure includes UGX.69,516,000,000 due from Government in respect of the Nsambya land. This amount has remained un-paid to URC for too long despite Government having disposed of the land to the public long ago implying that the Corporation may never be compensated for its land. Receivables URC budgeted to collect internal revenue of UGX 120.49 during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX 54.6bn was collected, representing a performance of 45.3% of the target. The Corporation did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Sleeper reconditioning; Kampala Station not fencing; Tororo Station Roof Repairs and; Rehabilitation of Steel Mill Jinja siding. The Corporation made losses for the past two years; UGX 37,783,152,000 (2020/2021) and UGX 66,151,318,000 (2019/2020). The Corporation’s losses and the ratios computed are an indication that Uganda Railways Corporation is not performing well in terms of profitability and ability to sustain provision of services without further Government intervention for funding and Management strategies to improve revenue generation. Management did not assess impairment of assets despite existence of impairment indicators. For instance, rental properties were being charged below market value. Uganda Railways Corporation land worth UGX.91,832,636,500 lacked land titles as evidence of URC’s rights to own and use the property. Management’s efforts to secure the land titles appear remote.

I noted that the bidder did not comply with some requirements within the bid document which were supposed to be the basis of evaluation. Despite the non-compliance at the preliminary stage, the bid was evaluated at the Technical stage without following procurement regulations. Government signed an agreement with Mango Tree (U) Ltd for the rehabilitation and upgrade of the Pamba ferry. However, the vessel was still grounded after a year of signing the agreement. An officer of URC irregularly signed to transfer land measuring 4.452 hectares in Lira (under FRV 220 Folio 13). The land was subdivided into plots 41-63, 52-62, 42-50 and the titles were being processed. Jinja Municipal took part of URC land in Jinja (6.3 acres) and gave it out to 58 developers, without consultation with the Corporation. |<|<|<|

The total time lapse since commencement of the construction works was 19 months constituting 64.01% of the total contract duration yet only 3.42% construction work had been achieved. Slow progress in Construction works has led to continued accumulation of both Commitment and Service Charges that amounted to UGX 3,224,867,623 and UGX 7,140,345,245 respectively as at the reporting date. I observed failure to procure Prefabricated Pipe Culvert Units to the project which is delaying project progress. The contractor could not progress through pipe culvert installation due to lack the culverts. There were delays in payments to the contractor that are likely to lead to interest charges. I observed that on 2nd June 2021, the contractor issued IPC No. 3 amounting to UGX 8,303,000,336 which was unpaid by 30th June, 2021 and interest on the late payment was due to commence on 28th July 2021. I observed delayed possession of site and land take over by the contractor. By 30th June, 2021, land acquisition was at 54.8% or 14.605 km of the main expressway where access to and possession was granted.

| 10 | Kapchorwa-Suam Road Project (Uganda National Roads Authority)  2021 Unqualified Opinion |<|  I observed delayed access and possession of site by the contractor. The last section of the road (from km 48+000 to km 073+000) was granted to the contractor on the 14th of June 2021 which is after 888 days. Further, additional land acquisition is still under progress from Km33+000 to Km73+000. Civil works from Km 46 to Km 58 have been put on hold pending additional land take especially for slope protection. It was also noted that new structures were being erected in the road reserve at |  
|^|^|<| Km17+692 and KM5+430. |  
|^|^|<|  I observed delays in execution of Project civil works. UNRA engaged M/S |  
|^|^|<| China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd on the 7th May |  
|^|^|<| 2018 to upgrade Kapchorwa-Suam road for a period of 36 months, with |  
|^|^|<| effect from 1st October 2018. There was an extension of time of 4.5 |  
|^|^|<| months up to 15th February 2022. Based on the extension of time, the |  
|^|^|<| time lapse as at 30th June 2021 was 33 months that is 81.40 %. |  
|^|^|<| However the reported cumulative physical progress for civil works was |  
|^|^|<| 43.14% with no active works from Km 55 to km 73. |  
|    I observed delayed completion of civil works on Upgrading of Bulima – Kabwoya Road (Lot2).The project commencement date was 1st December 2015, and the initial completion date was after 30 months on 31st May 2018. Successive revisions of completion dates extended the construction period by a further 22 months with the last revised completion date being 27th March 2021. A certificate of substantial completion was issued in January 2021, and the contractor allowed 12 months as the Defects Liability Period, expiring on 27th January 2022. The snag list included two main items; the construction of Hoima Town Roads and a way bridge. I observed delayed completion of civil works on Upgrading of Kigumba – Bulima Road (Lot1). The construction period was for 30 months (after commencement in March 2018), elapsing on 31st August 2020. When the Audit Team visited the site in September 2021, (42 months after commencement), the attained level of completion was approximately 95%. However, the new proposed completion date of 31st August had passed and no new completion date had been communicated. There were delays in payment of lot1 supervision fees. By the time of my audit, the Lot 1 Supervising Engineer’s unpaid invoices had accumulated to Euros 661,605 for the foreign component of the contract and UGX 1.38bn for the local component. The delays are likely to impact on the Engineer’s ability to perform the contractual obligations and in turn impact on the progress of the construction works. 11  Road Sector Support Project 4 – Kigumba-Masindi- Hoima-Kabwoya Road (2021) (Uganda National Roads Authority).  2021 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

| 12 | Albertine Regional Sustainable Development Project (ARSDP) (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2021 Unqualified Opinion |<|  I observed delayed implementation of civil works (Upgrading of Kyenjojo- Kabwoya Raod – 100km). The duration of the contract was 36 months (from 5th April 2016 to 4tth April 2019) excluding the Defects Liability Period. There were two extensions of time; the first one for 818 days i.e from 4th April 2019 up to 30th June 2021 and the second one for four months from 1st July 2021 to 31st October 2021. The right of way for the last section, Km 0 to Km 30 was handed over to the contractor on the 14th September 2018. However, as per the monthly report No. 63 for the |  
|^|^|<| month of June 2021, the progress of works was reported as 94.83% |  
|^|^|<| against planned of 96.27%. In addition to this, the contractor was |  
|^|^|<| supposed to substantially complete and hand over 30% of works within |  
|^|^|<| 180 days of the commencement date. However, as at 30th June 2021 |

|---|---|---|---|  
|^|<|<|  There were significant defects on the road works. I observed failure of |  
|^|<|<| road shoulders, lined drain and a speed hump at KM88+678. It was also |  
|^|<|<| observed that the contractor continued to construct line drains on steep |  
|^|<|<| slopes without scour checks. |  
|^|<|<|  I also observed poor quality works on some sections of the road |  
|^|<|<| construction. For example: poor visibility on the right-hand side of river |  
|^|<|<| Nguse bridge and also inadequate protection between the end of stone |  
|^|<|<| pitching and the stream at the bridge; noticeable bleeding at Km 52+511, |  
|^|<|<| failed line drain at Km71+200 RHS and damaged guard rail at km72+921 |  
|^|<|<| RHS; maintenance of the completed sections was poor with overgrown |  
|^|<|<| grass and silted drainages especially from Km 51 to Km 100, and; |  
|^|<|<| pedestrian walkways were not provided for in the design of Kagadi town |  
|^|<|<| roads which were under construction at time of the audit. |  
|^|<|<|  I noted lack of adherence to the insurance contract. The ICEA Workman’s |  
|^|<|<| Compensation Policy No 110-A2506044-18 covering the period 18th |  
|^|<|<| January 2021 to 17th February 2022 indicated that the number of staff |  
|^|<|<| insured are 181 only with neither the names nor the number of staff |  
|^|<|<| under each category/designation indicated but the monthly progress |  
|^|<|<| reports, the PAYE and NSSF returns for the period under review indicated |  
|^|<|<| that the contractor has over 400 staff. Further, the contract required that |  
|^|<|<| the insurances are in the joint names of the parties that is; UNRA and the |  
|^|<|<| contractor. However, the UAP Old Mutual contractor’s All Risk Policy No |  
|^|<|<| 0000461578 and the ICEA Motor Commercial Policy No. 080-A2-105193- |  
|^|<|<| 17 indicate that the insured was only the contractor. |  
|^|<|<|  Work Permits for all the foreign consultant’s and contractor’s staff were |  
|^|<|<| not provided for review. In the absence of the work permits for the |  
|^|<|<| foreign staff, the implication is that the expatriate staff are working |  
|^|<|<| irregularly in Uganda irregularly and this may lead to deportation, which |  
|^|<|<| will in turn affect the progress of work. |  
|     I observed significant delays in Project implementation. During the FY 2019/20, Project disbursements from ADF amounted to UA 6,679,508.53. From the signed loan amount of UA 70,000,000, only UA 24,672,103.72 representing 35% of the signed loan amount had been cumulatively disbursed through direct payments for Project expenditures as at 30th June 2020. However, 91% of the original project implementation time had elapsed as at 30th June 2020. Civil works for the upgrade of Bumbobi-Lwakhakha 44.5km road had attained 84% physical progress as at 30th June 2020 versus time progress and planned physical progress of 91%. The financial progress stood at 83% against plan of 92% as at 30th June 2020. For the upgrade of Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu (78.5km), 19.24% cumulative physical progress had been achieved as at 30th June 2020 although 33.4% was planned to be completed. During the FY 2019/20, UGX 3,033,479,790 (28%) of GOU counterpart project funds were re-allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project funds to other projects invalidates the approved plan for implementation of RSSP-V activities. UGX 267,083,716 was paid as interest on delayed payments. Such costs are un-necessary and represent unbudgeted expenditures which affect funds ear-marked for implementation of planned Project activities. UGX 226,500,820 had been paid to Government agencies (votes) including sub-counties and town councils during the FY 2019/20. These payments constitute revenue received for purpose of Government and 13  Road Sector Support Project 5 (Upgrading of Rukungiri- Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu and Bumbobi-Lwakhakha Roads (Uganda National Roads Authority).  2020.

During the FY 2020/21, Project disbursements from ADF amounted to UA 10,235,407.97 resulting cumulative disbursements of UA 34,907,511.69 (representing 49.9% of the signed amount of UA 70,000,000). Whereas the upgrading of Bumbobi-Lwakhakha (Lot2) 44.5km road had been substantially completed and the road was handed over to UNRA by the Contractor on 21st December 2020, the upgrading of Rukungiri-Kihihi- Ishasha/Kanungu (Lot1) 78.5km stretch had attained cumulative physical progress of only 42.6% completion rate against planned progress of 55.1% as at 30th June 2021. As at 30th June 2021, only 18 months |  
|^|^|<| (19.6%) time were left to the end of the extended Project |  
|^|^|<| implementation time of 31st December 2022. It is unlikely that UNRA will |

|^|^|<|  During the FY 2019/20, UGX 3,822,002,388 (36%) of GOU counterpart |  
|^|^|<| project funds were re-allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project |  
|^|^|<| funds to other projects invalidates the approved plan for implementation |  
|^|^|<| of RSSP-V activities. |  
|^|^|<|  UGX 150,255,638 was paid as interest on delayed payments. Such costs |  
|^|^|<| are un-necessary and represent unbudgeted expenditures which affect |  
|^|^|<| funds ear-marked for implementation of planned Project activities. |  
|^|^|<|  Financing charges were accumulating due to low utilization of the loan |  
|^|^|<| funds. UGX 3,770,851,261 was accrued on the disbursed and undisbursed |  
|^|^|<| loan balances with ADF during the FY 2020/2021. This is comprised of |  
|^|^|<| UGX 2,620,478,974 (69%) being charges on the undisbursed loan |  
|^|^|<| balances during the year and UGX 1,150,372,287 (31%) being charges |  
|^|^|<| on the disbursed loan amounts. For the last two financial years (FY |  
|^|^|<| 2019/20 and 2020/21), total charges of UGX 7,683,700,230 had accrued |  
|^|^|<| on the loan balances with ADF. This is comprised of UGX 5,699,720,562 |

|^|^|<| 1,983,979,668 (26%) being charges on the disbursed loan balances. |  
|    The Authority was made to pay interest as a result of delay to pay the contractor’s approved interim payment certificates (IPCs). The contractor invoked clause 14.7 and 14.8 of GCC and charged interest of UGX 373,044,074.47 for IPCs 1-6. Another interest amount of UGX 166,845,192 was paid for IPCs 11,12,13,14. The total interest paid for the delayed settlement of the IPCs amounted to UGX 539,889,266. These interest payments could have been higher if the dollar amounts had not been negotiated downwards by USD 108,262.29 due to disagreements in computations. During the FY 2019/20, UGX 892,920,000 of Project funds were re- allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project funds to other projects overrides established budgeting procedures. There were delays in recruitment of the Project consultant. In the period 15th March 2018 to 26th April 2021, there was no Project consultant procured to carry out supervisory roles for upgrading the Tirinyi-Kumi- 15 Upgrading of Tirinyi-Pallisa- Kumi and Pallisa-Kamonkoli Road project (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2020 |<|<|<|

In this period, the Directorate of Roads and Bridges Development of UNRA stepped in to carry out design review and supervisory roles in addition to their other activities. Recruitment of the Consultant, AECO (Abuljebain Engineering Consulting Office) delayed until 15th March 2021 and they commenced work on 26th April 2021 four months when the project physical progress was already at 92.51% and in time progress was 37.3 months (103.6%) to completion. The Consultant’s first report was in the month of May 2021. I observed delays in payment of Project Affected Persons. As of 30th June 2021 payment of PAPs was still incomplete with a total of 156 PAPs not yet paid. Tirinyi Pallisa Kumi (Lot 1) had 100 PAPs for land measuring 80.06 acres while Pallisa Kamonkoli road (Lot 2) had 56 PAPs not paid for 27.318 acres of land (by May 2021)  |<|<|

|^|^| to MoFPED for onward approval by Parliament. Re-allocation of Project |  
|^|^| funds to other projects overrides established budgeting procedures. |  
|^|^|  In 2019/20, I noted that Management incurred interest charges of UGX |  
|^|^| 539,889,266 in respect of 10 IPCs (1,2,3,4,5,6 and 11,12,13,14). |  
|^|^| However as of 30th June 2021, there were still 14 other interim payment |  
|^|^| certificates (Nos 7,8,9,10,16-23, and 25-26) whose payments were |  
|^|^| delayed making them eligible to interest charges. |  
|^|^|  There have been delays in project completion. Completion dates for |  
|^|^| project works were on 14th March 2021 for Lot 1 and 14th June 2021 for |  
|^|^| Lot 2 respectively. As of 30th June 2021, both Tirinyi-Pallisa-Kumi and |  
|^|^| Pallisa-Kamonkoli Road had not been completed as planned. Based on |  
|^|^| linear sections completed to final Asphalt surfacing, Lot 1 was 95.58% |  
|^|^| complete while Lot 2 was at 98.09%. |  
|^|^|  There was no documented plan for assets (housing units) built both in |  
|^|^| Lot 1 and Lot 2 currently used by the contractors and consultants as their |  
|^|^| accommodation after they have left. These units number approximately |  
|^|^| 28 permanent houses (2 type I houses, 6 type II houses 4 type IV |  
|^|^| houses) and multiple accommodations and engineer’s offices that have |  
|^|^| been constructed in land owned by UNRA. |  
|^|^|  I noted delays in relocation of utilities to pave way for road works. Five |  
|^|^| sub-contractors were approved by UNRA to relocate electricity, water |  
|^|^| lines and boreholes in Pallisa, Kumi, Mukongoro and Tirinyi towns at a |  
|^|^| total cost of UGX 1,517,595,734. As of 30th June 2021, work valued at |  
|^|^| UGX 1,260,024,061 had been certified and paid. The remaining works |  
|^|^| valued at UGX 257,571,673 were not yet completed. |  
|^|^|  There were disagreements between the consultant and the contractor on |  
|^|^| tests of completion on sections already handed over to the employer |  
|^|^| before certification. The disagreements are likely to cost Government |  
|^|^| interest charges if not timely resolved. |

The balance of UGX 2,268,428,581 (75%) was reallocated to other projects. Management did not avail the authorization used as basis to reallocate the funds to other projects. There has been accumulation of higher financing charges due to the low utilization of the signed loan. Charges of UGX 4,703,471,276 (being service charges and commitment charges of UGX 840,691,467 and UGX 3,862,779,809 respectively) were accrued during the FY 2020/21. Cumulatively, total charges of UGX 27,201,439,219 (being service charges and commitment charges of UGX 2,734,784,077 and UGX 24,466,655,142 respectively) have been accrued since loan signature on 16th February 2015.    |<|<|<|

Out of the total receipts of UGX.71.12Bn, UGX.69.13Bn was spent resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.1.99Bn representing an absorption level of 97.2%. The balance unspent was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund at the end of the financial year.

A sum of UGX.1,237,717,474 was paid for outstanding arrears that related to the prior year, but were not recognized in the prior year financial statements as payables. In addition, withholding tax of UGX.22,020,000 was not deducted and paid to URA. I noted that the court garnished the Commission’s bank Account with a balance of UGX.244,184,480 leading to the delay to clear the outstanding obligations to third parties. It was noted that the entity obtained a supplementary of UGX 10.62Bn was received by the entity but was not requisitioned by management. There were unsupported payments of domestic arrears amounting to UGX 14.4 Bn. Payments worth UGX 6.7Bn were paid to unverified arrears. In addition, payables to Church of Uganda amounting to UGX 15Bn, and Receivables amounting to UGX 3.966 Bn relating to the overpayment to Kampala archdiocese in the prior year were not recognised. In addition, outstanding arrears of UGX 1.2Bn related to prior year but paid during the year have not been recognised in the current year. The Commission does not have a land inventory and database for all government land and properties under its jurisdiction that are either occupied by tenants, vacant, acquired under compensation (but not yet re-distributed to the bona fide occupants), or acquired and owned by other government institutions and missions abroad.

|     URA operated at least six operations bank accounts in commercial banks with an annual turnover of over UGX.1.1 Tn, in contravention of Section 33 (5), (6) and (7) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015. The action overrides the Government financial management controls and distorts the monetary policy. UGX.9.6Bn was advanced to staff through their bank accounts to purchase goods, services, and other activities without following regulations. The practice is irregular and also exposes Government funds to a risk loss through misuse. UGX.1.16Bn paid through mobile money to various suppliers for the provision of services were not adequately supported with accountability documents as required; as a result, I could not ascertain whether the funds were utilised correctly for the intended activities. Management made cash withdrawals amounting to UGX.5.2Bn during the year, contrary to Section 11 of PFMA 2015, as well as Section 7 of the URA Cash Policy that sets the maximum insurable cash limit to UGX.20Mn. The practice has been recurring and exposes government funds to a risk of misuse of cash and loss. Unqualified 3 URA Corporate 2020/21 Opinion |<|<|<|

|     The Authority awarded multi-year contracts to the tune of UGX.18.7Bn without evidence of approval of these multi-year commitments by the Parliament. This was contrary to Section 23(1) of the PFMA 2015. Planned procurements worth UGX.25.1Bn were not implemented by 30th June 2021. This adversely affects the realisation of critical government programs. Management explained that the delays were due to various reasons, some of which are beyond their control. During the financial year 2020/21, the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP) registered only 167,211 taxpayers against a target of 436,869 taxpayers representing a 38.27% registration success and a shortfall of 61.7%. In revenue terms, although TREP had a revenue target of UGX.124.58 Bn in FY 2020/21, it had only collected UGX.49.93Bn by 30th June 2021, representing a 40% performance rate. The paltry performance was attributed to COVID-19 effects, riots and the political environment, that hindered field activities. The Ministry of Local Government had planned to implement activities worth UGX.4.4Bn under TREP activities but only implemented activities worth UGX.3.3Bn, leaving un-implemented activities worth UGX.1.1Bn despite receiving all funding. As a result, the e-LogRev objective of simplifying and strengthening the local revenue collection systems for Local Governments may not be achieved in time. |<|<|<|

|^|^|<| (11%). Under collection of revenue affects cash flow performance of |  
|^| Unqualified Opinion |<| Government and realisation of the planned service delivery targets. Management attributed the performance to the adverse impact of COVID- |  
|^|^|<| 19 pandemic. |  
|^|^|<|  I reviewed the statement of comparison of target and actual revenue |  
|^|^|<| collection by the tax head and noted that revenues from different sources |  
|^|^|<| worth UGX.86.979Bn were not budgeted for, despite collecting significant |  
|^|^|<| incomes on these tax heads for the past two years leading to under- |  
|^|^|<| budgeting. Lack of budget provisions of the tax heads conceals revenue |  
|^|^|<| potential, distorts revenue projections and may lead to un-appropriate |  
|^|^|<| performance assessments and related bonuses. |  
|^|^|<|  Uganda Tax/GDP ratio remained low at 12.5% in 2020/21, compared to |  
|^|^|<| other countries in the region and globally. This performance was similar |  
|^|^|<| to last year's performance. This implies that tax bases have not widened |  
|^|^|<| or deepened enough to tax all potential sources. |  
|^|^|<|  There was an increase in total Tax Arrears from UGX.3.009Tn in 2019/20 |  
|^|^|<| to UGX.4.519Tn in the financial year 2020/21 representing a total |  
|^|^|<| increase of UGX.1.492Tn or percentage increase in total Tax Arrears of |  
|^|^|<| 50%. The Increase denies Government the required resources to deliver |  
|^|^|<| more services. |  
|^|^|<|  The contract between the Government of Uganda (GoU) and a private |  
|^|^|<| company had since expired even though the Company had continued to |  
|^|^|<| manufacture motor vehicle registration numbers for taxpayers. Expired |  
|^|^|<| contracts expose the Government to the risk of loss of revenue without a |  
|^|^|<| remedy. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that government had continued to engage only two private |  
|^|^|<| companies, making them monopolies in providing motor vehicle |  
|^|^|<| registration number plates for more than eight (8) years without opening |  
|^|^|<| it up for competition. The Monopoly exposes the taxpayer to high prices |

|   Section 26(i) of the PFMA 2015 (as amended) provides that a Contingencies Fund shall every financial year be replenished with an amount equivalent to 0.5% of the appropriated annual budget of Government of the previous financial year. The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2019/20) was UGX.40.49Trillion, which would have translated into UGX.202.43Bn funding for the Contingencies’ Fund in the year under review. I noted however, that Parliament only appropriated UGX.62Bn to the Contingencies fund, causing a deficit of UGX.140.3Bn. Underfunding of the Contingencies Fund distorts implementation of the approved budget for the current year as evidenced by budget cuts and reallocations to fund supplementary budgets relating to natural disasters and emergencies that occurred during the year. Audit of the withdrawals made off the Contingencies Fund revealed that a total of UGX.62,070,000,000 was transferred to the Fund bank account held at Bank of Uganda. The funds were consequently transferred to entity bank accounts and expensed off the IFMS, which makes it difficult to follow up and track to confirm the adherence to the approved budget guidelines and also confirm accuracy of the reports generated. Spending off the IFMS also exposes the funds to the risk of misuse due to lack of transparency. 9 Contigencies’ Fund. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

| Section 63 of the Insurance Act requires the Insurance Training levy to be reconciled with Insurers within 60 days after the end of the calendar year.

|    Arising out of a supreme court decision, all tax disputes in Uganda must first commence in the Tax appeal Tribunal before they move to any other court. A review of the cases filed at the Tribunal, in the last three years, revealed that there was an increase of cases filed from 40 in 2017 to 176 in 2020. In spite of the increase in cases, there has been no increase in the number of members of the Tribunal which has necessitated that the members of the Tribunal sit every day not withstanding their regular involvement in the administrative aspects of the Tribunal. The current structure of the remuneration of the members indicates that each member will be paid a sitting allowance and a retainer. This has resulted into the Tribunal spending the bulk of its money on the payment of allowances to the Tribunal members. During the reviews, I noted that there were instances in which a Tribunal member is an active partner of a Firm that has a case before the Tribunal. Whereas the said Tribunal Member does not form part of the panel of the committee adjudicating the disputes, this presents a potential conflict of interest for the members of the committee who work with him and have to decide the matters involving his Firm for which he is an active partner. I noted that the approved organisation structure for the Tribunal, did not have a provision for internal audit function and indeed, this role has not been assigned to any staff. This is contravention with the PFMA 2015, and it also denies the Tribunal an early warning mechanism in cases of errors of omission or commission. 13 Tax Appeals Tribunal. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2,572,820,000 during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.1,410,970,500 was collected, representing a performance of 55% of the target, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1,161,849,500. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.2.572Bn during the period, out of which UGX.1.383Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.189Bn which is 46.23% of the budget. I observed that in cases where outputs were not quantified, management reported performance in generic ways such as tenants sensitised to pay rent, court attended etc, without specifying the number/quantities achieved. All five (5) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.1.383Bn were partially implemented. I noted that in a twist of events, the Board refunded the sum of UGX.0.860Bn that had been deposited in respect of the property, citing the fact that the property had been donated to the tenant, but this was not supported by a Board resolution. I observed that according to a disclosure in note 19 of the accounts, receivables have increased from UGX.3.35Bn last year to UGX.8.21Bn this year.

In this regard, the concession is only being enjoyed by two firms which creates competitive disadvantages to the other players in the industry. there was no mechanism in place to monitor compliance with the set targets despite having reached the first milestone. the memorandum of understanding signed did not provide for reporting obligations for the beneficiaries. There was thus no justification for the continued incentive all refunds effected so far are made from supplementary budgets implying none sustainability of the incentive. Indeed a total of UGX.5.41Bn remains outstanding as at 30th June 2021.    In line with the above, it is apparent that the subsidy is being implemented with irregularities. Government is exposed to continued expenditure without due regard to achievement of the intended objectives. The Uganda Agriculture Insurance Scheme (UAIS) is a Public Private Partnership between GoU and the Private Sector represented by the Uganda Insurers Association and insurance companies under the agro- Consortium. The purpose of the scheme is to hedge Ugandan farmers against natural calamities beyond their control. However, review of implementation revealed that there was lack of a mutual agreement on Marketing of the scheme to the potential beneficiaries and a number of conditions in the MoU are not yet fulfilled. This has limited its access to potential beneficiaries and also raised transparency concerns in regard to how the current beneficiaries were identified. The PPP Act 2015 provides that there is to be established a Project Development Fund to support public private partnerships initiatives. However, six years later, there is no evidence of operationalization of the Fund by the Minister. Failure to establish the fund may be a contributory factor to the slow uptake and limited feasibility studies of the Public Private Partnerships. previous financial year. I also noted that arrears relating to unsettled obligations to international organizations stood at UGX.49.49Bn with some dating as far back as financial year 2014/15.  GoU, through MOFPED, offered additional incentives of USD Cents 5/KWH to companies in the Cotton, Textile and Apparels (CTA) industry.

|       The Authority received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.50.43Bn, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by law. These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government. During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery.

It was observed that the term of office for the previous Board expired on 5th October 2019, and no replacement Board had been appointed by the time of issuance of my report.

| I noted that the entity did not budget for any tax revenue despite collecting 84 million. Failure to budget for NTR conceals the entity’s potential collect revenue and also complicates assessment of performance since there is no benchmark. I noted that out of the budgeted revenue of UGX. 8.899Bn from the Central Government for 2020/2021, and only UGX. 8.035Bn was received, representing a performance of only 90 % of the release. The entity had a cash balance brought forward of UGX.134,172,095 from FY 2019/2020 and received UGX.8,035,212,980 making total cash available for spending in FY 20/21 of UGX.8,169,385,075. Out of the total cash available to spend, only UGX.3,730,897,866 was actually spent by the entity, representing an absorption level of 46%. This resulted into a balance of UGX.4,438,487,209 (54%) as unspent funds.

|     The Beareau was unable to activate the use of the Digital Tracking System (DTS) to enforce conformity to standards of selected items and claim the associated fees due to absence of an enabling regulation to operationalise the Service. As a result, the Buereau was unable to claim for a total of UGX.13Bn charged on goods and services for conformity stamps issued by the provider towards conformity enforcement. There is a risk of misuse of the amounts involced by the private provider. The Bureau released 366 consignments without testing due to lack of capacity and another 633 consignments released due to the absence of standards to test these commodities for conformity. Lack of capacity may lead to the release of sub-standard products to the market. I noted that out of the approved staff structure of 666 positions, the Bureau had only filled 439, leaving a staffing gap of 227 (34 %). As a result, there was staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. There is a risk of sub-standard goods entering the country through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present. It was noted that procurements to the tune of UGX.2.735Bn were not completed as of 30th June 2021. This was attributed to several reasons, including failure to attract competitive bidders for some procruements, delayed submission of clear specifications, especially for specialised equipment, late submissions/ initiations of procurement requisitions by the users, as well as delayed deliveries due to COVID-19 especially for specialised Equipment. Un implemented activities imply that the provision of critical government programs and associated services were delayed. 8 Uganda National Bureau of Standards.  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

|^||<| fully absorb funds by the Corporation, leads to non-achievement of |  
|^|^|<| development objectives. |  
|^|^|<|  The UDC Act 2016 requires capitalisation of UDC to the tune of |  
|^|^|<| UGX.500Bn. The same Act also established an Industrial and Economic |  
|^|^|<| Development Fund which was to be run by the UDC. However, 5 years |  
|^|^|<| later, the company has never been capitalised to that tune; currently the |  
|^|^|<| capitalisation grants have accumulated to UGX.311Bn and the Industrial |  
|^|^|<| and Economic Development Fund has never been operationalized. The |  
|^|^|<| current funding model, is such that capitalisation grants over the years |  
|^|^|<| come assigned to specific projects which nullifies the investment appraisal |  
|^|^|<| process of UDC. This has the disadvantage of earmarking funds for |  
|^|^|<| investments that are not ready or even viable leading to the low |  
|^|^|<| absorption noted above. |  
|^|^|<|  An amount of UGX.30.46Bn was invested in various companies by UDC |  
|^|^|<| during the year without valuation. Shareholding in these companies had |  
|^|^|<| not been secured by the time of reporting. There is a risk of loss of value. |  
|^|^|<|  Although the UDC Act 2016 provides that the Corporation will take over |  
|^|^|<| the interest of government in seven entities specified in schedule 2 and to |  
|^|^|<| manage, promote and facilitate the interest of the government in those |  
|^|^|<| entities, 5 years later, this had not been done except for Nile Hotel |  
|^|^|<| Limited. The other entities include: Amber House Limited, Embassy |  
|^|^|<| House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort, Phoenix |  
|^|^|<| Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Limited. There is a risk of loss of strategic |  
|^|^|<| direction and government may not be aware whether the national |  
|^|^|<| objectives of import substitution, employment and industrialization are |  
|^|^|<| being met by these entities. |  
| The Authority received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.50.43Bn, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by law. These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government.    During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage 10  Investment   Uganda Authority. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

| management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery.   |<|<|<|

I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.82.Bn (Exclusive of UGX.30Bn prior-year surplus approved for re-investment during the year under review). The entity budgeted to receive UGX.6.24Bn from donors, however, UGX.5.74Bn was realized, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.501Mn (8%) of the budget. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.0.72Bn, out of which UGX.0.762Bn was received, resulting into an excess receipt of UGX.0.042Bn, representing 5.8% of the budget I noted that Management re-assessed its revenue performance and requested the Board to approve a contingency plan to limit the expenditure of the Authority to only UGX.72.595Bn in line with the reduced revenue collections to finance only priority activities in the original approved budget of UGX.119.469Bn for FY 2020-2021. I noted that the Authority prepared and submitted all the quarterly reports to the line ministry. However, there were delays in submission of Q1, Q2 & Q4 performance reports due to the effect of the covid-19 pandemic. I noted decreasing Tourism Revenues due to Covid-19 Effect. It was observed that the Authority has a total outstanding receivables balance of UGX.3.303Bn in the statement of financial position, of which UGX.2.244Bn are unpaid overdue fees from concessionaires that have been outstanding for more than a year. It was noted that the entity has outstanding payables of UGX.71.655Bn in the statement of financial position of which UGX.8.422Bn are accrued staff gratuity that becomes due at the end of each staff’s four year contract. UWA had only disbursed UGX.642,455,690 in respect of revenue sharing for the surrounding communities in Lake Mburo National Park, leaving a balance of UGX.9,697,730,137 un-disbursed. The Accountabilities of the disbursed grants have not yet been availed by the beneficiary communities through to the district local governments by the time of audit on 3rd November 2021.

|    I noted that UWEC is one of the entities affected by the Government rationalisation policy on mergers anticipated to be concluded in 2023. By the time of reporting, discussions on transitional arrangements were ongoing. However, I was not provided with the transitional plans for a smooth merger. Delayed decision making leads to costly mergers and uncertainity amonst the stakeholders. Five (5) procurements with a total value of UGX.3.239Bn were not implemented as planned due to insufficient release of funds from GOU and the adverse effects of the covid-19 pandemic resulting into delayed service delivery. Although some electronic equipment and motor vehicles at cost of UGX.331Mn had been fully depreciated as per the previous financial year, they were still in use. Under the circumstances, the benefits accruing from them are not matched with their usage/expenditure. Management explained that the revaluation of assets had started, but COVID – 19 effects hindered the process. 9 Uganda Wildlife Education Conservation Centre. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

This affected implementation of planned activities. I further noted that the Ministry did not seek a revision of its budget and work plan, as provided for by Section 17 (3) of the PFMA 2015, following the revenue shortfall. |  
|^||<|^|  
|^|^|<|  Out of the approved staffing level of 334, the Ministry has only 201 |

|^|^|<| Included in the unfilled positions are key ones (1 Director, 3 Asst. |

|^|^|<| The first installment of UGX.10.4Bn was paid on 12th March 2020. |

|^|<|<| UGX.13Bn to UGX.3.2Bn given the preliminary findings by a company |  
|^|<|<| engaged to assess recoverability of the funds. |  
|    Contrary to Section 45 (3) of the Public Finance and Management Act, 2015, the Board failed to implement procurements worth UGX.2.79Bn which had been indicated in their procurement plan. Unimplemented procurements signify unimplemented activities and therefore delayed service delivery. Contrary to Section 26 (4) of the PPDA 2003, procurements for stationery worth UGX.1.67Bn were concluded without carrying out market assessments. As a result, I could not establish how the estimated unit cost for these procurements was arrived at, thus implying that the procurements may have been awarded at exorbitant costs. A review of the Board's establishment structure revealed that 38 posts out of the approved 85 remained vacant during the year, indicating a 45% understaffing level. Most notable among the vacant positions are key staffs like the Director Marketing, Director Quality Assurance, Director Finance and planning, and Manager Human Resource. Inadequate staffing levels not only deprive the entity of the skills required to enhance service delivery but also frustrates segregation of duty. 11 Uganda Tourism Board. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|

I however noted from the Grid Energy Reports submitted to ERA, that the Company was unable to meet its target energy losses and most of its service territories registered an average of 32.7% power losses. I noted non -compliance by the WENRECO to the terms of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement, such as provision of semi-annual reports on status of the assets, safe storage of UEDCL connection materials, participation in the physical network inspection, submission of asset modifications register among others.

As at 30th June 2021, implementation of infrastructure such as roads, power supply, water supply and Information Communication Technology connection had not yet commenced. I noted delays in the implementation of the Refinery Project. As at 30th June 2021, the refinery investor had not met the targets for some Project milestones.

|^|<|<|  I sampled 40 critical activities implemented under 7 sampled departments |

|^|<|<| was an increment of 25% from the financial year 2019/20. The provision |  
|^|<|<| relates to customers with unpaid balances in contravention of the terms |  
|^|<|<| and conditions of the power sales agreement. I further noted that 74.7% |  
|^|<|<| of the provisions were attributable to only one Company. |  
|^|<|<|  Analysis of the trade and other payables revealed an increment of 18.7Bn |  
|^|<|<| from UGX.740.8Bn in 2019/20. Included in these payables were amounts |  
|^|<|<| of UGX.71.2Bn and USD.4.7 million which have been outstanding for over |

|^|<|<|  M/s UMEME and M/s UEDCL withheld UETCL revenue of UGX 64Bn and |  
|^|<|<| 10.31Bn, respectively on account of evacuation losses and non-payment |

|^|<|<| UETCL’s ability to pay electricity generators. |  
|^|<|<|  The land titling process was not satisfactory on most of UETCL Projects. |  
|^|<|<| UETCL takes an average of 3 years to conclude the titling process in |  
|^|<|<| contravention of the 6 months period warranted which exposes the |  
|^|<|<| company to a risk of litigation and potential encroachment. |  
|^|<|<|  UETCL incurred deemed energy costs of UGX 87.7Bn on thirteen (13) |  
|^|<|<| PPAs, save for me HPP were directly financed through the tariff system, |  
|^|<|<| hence impacting on the electricity price to the final consumer. |  
|^|<|<|  I noted that UETCL incurred about UGX 494,150,000 in replacing |  
|^|<|<| vandalized tower equipment during the year under review. I further noted |  
|^|<|<| that the company incurred UGX. 1.6Bn in replacement costs on assorted |  
|^|<|<| transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021. |  
|^|<|<|  I noted delays in concluding the procurement process for a sample of |  
|^|<|<| procurements with a total contract sum of UGX.17.8Bn with |  
|^|<|<| procurements lasting an average of 3 years and some cases going up to 5 |

|^|<|<| intended project objectives. |  
|    Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.3.71Bn, UGX.3.71Bn was utilized. This represents an absorption level of 100%. I noted that the Company failed to maintain National Strategic Reserves. In the period under review, the Consortium failed to meet the required National Strategic Reserve levels of 12 million litres per month. Failure to restock petroleum reserves exposes the Country to supply shocks and a risk of inflated prices in the event of disruptions in the petroleum supplies chain.

I noted that the Company had an outstanding receivable of UGX.1.26Bn as at 30th June 2021, 54% of the amount relates to unpain rent from Tibet Hima Mining Co. Ltd. Delayed recovery of outstanding revenues affects the Company’s liquidity position. I noted that the Company had outstanding payables of UGX.2.28Bn.

I also noted that whereas the University had prepared and submitted its strategic plan to NPA for approval, it had not yet been approved at the time of audit in October 2021. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2021 and noted that the University budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.95.84Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.58.29Bn was collected, representing a performance of 60.82% of the target. I further noted that the University budgeted to receive UGX.363.74Bn out of which UGX.359.86Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.3.88Bn which is 1.1% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect implementation of the planned activities.

The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by PFMA. I noted that the University received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX.237,398,885,878 which was not declared to Treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament.

I observed that in cases where outputs were either partially or not quantified, management reported performance in generic ways.

- I assessed implementation of two (2) out puts that were fully quantified with a sample of seven (7) activities worth UGX.265.85Bn and noted that one (1) output with a total of three (3) activities worth UGX 4.06Bn was fully implemented while one (1) output with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX.261.78Bn were partially implemented.

- During the financial year under review, the University lost its main administration building and other assets therein to a fire that gutted the main administration Block on the 20th day of September 2020. The fire caused substantial damage to the main building whose value was estimated at UGX.15,434,782,500 by the Chief Government Valuer.

- The Statement of reported losses of Public moneys, stores and other assets during the year showed the reported losses of assets/property of total estimated value of UGX.16,457,577,500.

- The University had a receivables balance of UGX.25,527,015,916 as at 30/6/2021 broken down as accrued income of UGX.23,372,851,776 and a prepayment of UGX.2,154,164,140 to UMEME for electricity bulk purchase. The accumulation of receivables may lead to under performance of the university on its planned activities.

- The University has an outstanding pension liability of UGX.18,920,219,207, inclusive of interest as reported in the Statement of Financial Position for the year ended 30th June 2021 resulting from accumulation of In-House Retirement Benefits since 2010. Delayed payment of retirement benefits may result in nugatory expenditure if the retirees decide to take the University to court.

- The Statement of Financial Position showed accumulation of domestic arrears of UGX.7,819,385,752 as at 30th June 2021. I noted that majority of these arrears were from the prior years. There is a risk that the University could face litigation from the suppliers and other beneficiaries.

- I noted that the main University installations/buildings such as the Senate, the Library, School of Women and Gender Studies and others are not comprehensibly insured. In case of a catastrophe, the University is at risk of huge financial obligations to the tenants.

- I noted that there are non-qualifying persons occupying the University buildings. These were identified to be former University staff (retirees), unknown persons and Uganda Police Officers whose services were transferred from Makerere University.

- I noted that water bills for the year under review were neither read nor submitted to the finance department for deductions. I noted that staff salaries were arbitrarily deducted to clear their water consumption without following one’s monthly water consumption.

- The University owns various pieces of land totalling to 102 Acres in prime locations around Kampala including Makerere, Mulago and Makindye. Inspection of the land revealed that the land is heavily encroached upon and a number of cases have been in court for more than five (5) years.

|^|^|<| unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by |  
|^|^|<| the PFMA. |  
|^|^|<|  The University received off-budget financing to the tune of |  
|^|^|<| UGX.584,396,093 which was not declared to treasury and, therefore, not |

78 Makerere University Busines School.  
2020/21

Opinion Unqualified

- I noted that the University had its plan approved and certified by NPA and the plan is aligned to the national development plan. This greatly supports the achievement of NDP-III objectives.

- I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of 56.845Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only 33.589bn was collected, representing a performance of 59.1% of the target.

- The University budgeted to receive UGX.102.629Bn out of which UGX.97.03Bn was availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX5.59Bn, which is 5.5% of the budget.

- Out of the total warrants of UGX.97.03Bn received during the financial year. UGX.96.85Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.18Bn representing an absorption level of 99.8%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA.

- I noted that the School received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX. 549Bn from NOHRED/NORAD Project Support which was not declared to treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament.

- I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities for a sample of twelve (12) outputs with a total of seventy three (73) activities and expenditure of UGX.91.667Bn and noted that five (5) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.031Bn were fully quantified. One (1) output with a total of twenty four (24) activities and expenditure worth UGX.77.002Bn, was insufficiently quantified while six (6) outputs with a total of thirty five (35) activities and expenditure worth UGX 11.633Bn were not quantified at all.

- I assessed the implementation of five (5) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX 3.031Bn and noted that; Three (3) outputs with eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX 1.694Bn were fully implemented. One (1) output with two (2) activities worth UGX.1.336Bn was partially implemented while one (1) output with four (4) activities with a budget of UGX.1.159Bn was not implemented.

- The entity disclosed receivables to the tune of UGX.21,730,133,664. This reflected an increase in receivables by UGX.12,025,676,995 (124%) from the previous year’s balance of UGX.9,704,456,669. The accumulation of receivables impacts negatively on the operations of the University and the education service delivery.

- The Statement of Financial Position showed accumulation of payables to the tune of UGX.1,215,592,931 as at 30th June 2021. I noted that these payables were accumulated in the current year and largely related to suppliers of goods and services. Accumulation of payables poses a risk of litigation and or loss of trust against the University from the suppliers of the goods and services.

- The financial statements showed that MUBS was involved in several court cases/legal proceedings of a total value UGX.2,899,977,221 in various courts of law that remained pending as at the financial year end. There is a risk that in case of un-favourable rulings, the School may incur more financial losses.

- A review of the statement of cash flow revealed payment of domestic arrears of UGX.9,601,334,785 against UGX.330,708,964 that was budgeted and warranted for payment of domestic arrears. Payment of

I noted that the School had five (5) pieces of land recorded in the assets register that have never been valued to ascertain the monetary value. I also noted that the land in Kireka had squatters and the possibility of reclaiming it may prove to be challenging. The encroachment on the School land was attributed to failure to gazette and develop the land.  |<|<|<|

During the financial year, a total of UGX.29,230,320 was paid to the Executive Director as man-day allowance for signing 12 contracts on behalf of the organization, yet this is one of her roles for which a monthly salary is paid. A total of UGX.272,694,000 was paid to various staff as allowances for working over the weekend. The internal audit department had only one draft internal audit report with no evidence that the report was submitted to the Accounting Officer and Internal Auditor General. PIBID recruited staff during the year 2019/2020 without an approved recruitment plan for the period.

| President’s Office effective July 2021. I however did not obtain evidence of a proper transition plan which has led to delayed disbursement of funding for subventions and independent projects. The merger further rendered 136 technical scientist staff redundant and were not paid emoluments by the end of November, 2021. I advised management to ensure that a smooth transition process is undertaken. Out of the total budget for the financial year of UGX.150Bn, only UGX.144.6Bn was received by the Ministry resulting into a shortfall of UGX.5.737Bn (equivalent to 3.5% of the budget). Shortfalls in revenue result into non implementation of planned activities. Out of 20 quantified activities worth UGX.105.9Bn that were assessed; 13 activities representing 65% were fully implemented, 5 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 10% were not implemented. I advised management to roll over critical activities to subsequent years and ensure that they are implemented before the end of the National Development Plan III. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.834Mn were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I advised management to always ensure that proper authorization is obtained before implementing any unbudgeted activities. Most of the research projects that had received funds for COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments had not made much progress. Delays were majorly attributed to the late disbursement of funds and delayed delivery of Equipment.

Only 59% of the seed fund had been released in the previous three financial years, casting doubt as to whether the balance of UGX.58.4Bn (41%) would be released in the  |  
|^|^|<| remaining one year. Failure to promptly fund the project, may lead to |

I noted that there was no evidence that the Accounting Officer prepared or submitted the annual budget performance reports of the Council by 31st July 2021 as required by regulations. I noted that the entity did not prepare and submit the annual monitoring plans to the line Ministry for consolidation and onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance Economic and Economic Planning. I established that UGX.94Mn was directly paid to staff’s personal bank accounts, yet this money could have been directly paid to the intended final recipients. Out of the 85 planned activities assessed, 69 outputs/activities representing 81% were implemented; 9 outputs/activities representing 11% were partially implemented, while seven (7) outputs/activities representing 8% were not implemented at all. fully I noted that the Council did not produce the annual report as required by the UNCST Act. A review of the procurement file for the Supply of ICT Equipment under EDCTP-SCRECU Project revealed no evidence of any public bid opening session, which creates doubts as to whether the bidders attended the bid opening session.

Opinion

Unqualified

- Out of the approved budget of UGX. 153.01Bn, a sum of UGX.148.47Bn was warranted resulting into a shortfall of UGX.4.54Bn, representing 2.97% of the budget.

- Out UGX.148.47Bn warranted, a sum of UGX.147.63Bn was spent indicating an absorption rate of 99.4%.

- The Ministry received off-budget financing of UGX.11.598 Bn that was not appropriated by Parliament.

- I sampled fifteen (15) outputs with a total of thirty (30) activities and expenditure worth UGX.105.44Bn, representing 87.76% of the total budget, and noted that 9 outputs (36%) with 11 activities worth UGX.79.33Bn were not quantified at all. In addition, out of the 16 quantified outputs with 20 activities assessed, 12 outputs (75%) were achieved, 15 activities (75%) were fully achieved/implemented, while 4 out puts with 5 activities representing 25% were partially achieved/implemented.

- The Ministry had payables of UGX 37,394,048,164. Of these, a sum of UGX 36,075,485,050 (96.5%) related to funds not remitted to older persons under the Social Assistance Grant and Empowerment Programme (SAGE).

- The Ministry made a cumulative total disbursement of UGX.113.22Bn to the Youth Livelihood Programme (YLP) by 30th June 2021 to 13,095 Youth groups. However, out of the expected recoverable funds of UGX.78.10Bn, only UGX.40.14Bn was recovered, leaving an outstanding amount of UGX.37.96Bn.

- The Ministry recovered UGX.40.14Bn YLP funds from Local Governments, but only UGX.37.59Bn was transferred to the recovery account in BOU, leaving a balance of UGX.2.54Bn.

- I noted that out of the total UGX. 37.59Bn received on the YLP revolving fund account in Bank of Uganda, only UGX.19.93Bn (53%) was revolved to other Youth Interest Groups, leaving a balance of UGX.17.65Bn (47%) not revolved.

- Out of the budgeted UGX.188Bn for the Women Entrepreneur Programme (UWEP) for the period of five years since financial year 2015/16, only 135Bn (72%) had been released over the same period leading to a programme budget shortfall of UGX.53Bn (28%).

- Out of UGX.27.61Bn due for recovery under UWEP by 30th June, 2021, a sum of UGX.20.19Bn was recovered leaving a balance of UGX.7.42Bn, thus indicating a recovery rate of 73%.

- A sum of UGX.2.64Bn recovered under the UWEP could not be tagged to specific Local Governments and individual women groups.

- The Labour advisory (LAB) Board did not function in the financial year under review to deliberate on matters affecting workers. This meant that no advisory services were extended to Government on matters of employment and industrial relations.

- The Medical Arbitration Board (MAB) met only in one quarter during the entire financial year (February 2021) despite having over 150 pending cases awaiting arbitration as at 30th June 2021. I further noted that some cases have been pending for over 9 years.

- I noted that Uganda has only three signed bilateral agreements in protection of migrant workers with Saudi Arabia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Agreements with other

I observed conflicting in the Council governing laws. Section 51(2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 requires the Accounting Officer of a public corporation, within two months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Accountant-General, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury. On the contrary, Section 18 (1) Part IV of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 1996 requires the Council to keep proper books of accounts and prepare the annual financial statements of accounts for the immediately preceding financial year not later than three months in the following year. Conflict in the governing laws hampers effective execution of UNMC mandate. Section 4 of the UNMC Act 1996, requires each Council member to be a seconded representative of a particular institution or body and must be appointed by the Minister. However, a review of Council Members records revealed that out of the seventeen (17) members, none of them were seconded representatives of their respective bodies. Good Corporate Governance practices require separation of duties of board members to ensure their independence in the discharge of duties. On the contrary, a review of the composition of the Audit Committee revealed that Chairperson of the full council is also a member of the committee. I noted that the Council had not been managed by a substantive Registrar since 2017. The current Registrar’s initial appointment ran from November 2018 to March 2019. However, management did not provide a valid appointment letter to confirm her appointment after March 2019. A review of the Governing council minute ref FC/08/14/06/2020 revealed that council members were concerned about the significant delays in issuing of Practicing Certificates that hindered the recruitment of nurses in the industry. Furthermore, Management did not avail status reports on certificates that were produced. Payment files and PPDA monthly reports revealed that supplies and service worth UGX 46,183,800 were procured and paid without going through the procurement process given that there were no LPOs or procurement documents availed to confirm that the supplier went through the procurement process. UNMC has three (3) operational vehicles. However, a detailed review of the fleet management revealed that there were no log books maintained to track the vehicle movements as required by the regulations.

The balance of five (5) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX.011Bn were insufficiently quantified which made it difficult to assess extent of their delivery.

The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. I noted that the entity submitted all the quarterly performance reports after the prescribed deadline. The Accounting Officer explained that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the support offices were operating at 10% which led to delays in preparation and submission of the quarterly performance reports. According to the patient admission schedule and the strategic plan, the Hospital currently handles between 750 and 780 in-patients per month compared to its bed capacity of 550 patients. This implies that 200 to 230 admitted patients either share beds or sleep on the floor. I noted that UGX.93,717,182 was utilized for repairs and service for vehicles during the year under review. However, there were no repair and service analysis registers for the 13 vehicles that were maintained.

However, the Institute received funds from GoU and was in the process of procuring a new Nitrogen plant. The Institute received the entire budget of UGX.8.97bn out of which UGX.8.95bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.20.76m (representing an absorption level of 98.8%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. Two (2) outputs with a total of two (2) activities and expenditure of UGX 2.23bn were fully quantified out of the eight (8) outputs with a total of twenty-two (22) activities and expenditure of UGX 8.20bn sampled for assessment. None of the two (2) quantified activities under the two (2) outputs was implemented at all.

|^|^|<| year. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that the District made payroll deductions of UGX.123 |  
|^|^|<| million, but did not remit concurrently with the salary payments |  
|^|^|<| in 8 out of 12 months. On average, it delayed by 55 days. I |

|^|<|<| from other Government Units. However, only |  
|^|<|<| UGX.14,007,769,263 (80%) was received. The Accounting Officer |  
|^|<|<| explained that low Local Revenue performance was due to the |  
|^|<|<| effects of COVID 19 lockdown that affected the performance of |  
|^|<|<| markets and secondly the disaster of floods impacted negatively |  
|^|<|<| on our major source of revenue, fisheries where most landing |

|^|<|<| from other Government Units. However, only |  
|^|<|<| UGX.14,007,769,263 (80%) was received. The Accounting Officer |  
|^|<|<| explained that The under-performance of other government |  
|^|<|<| transfers was due to low performance of DRDIP. The funding for |  
|^|<|<| DRDIP was only for approved sub projects which were generated |  
|^|<|<| by the beneficiary groups. |  
|^|<|<|  The District budgeted to receive UGX. 655,424,300 as |  
|^|<|<| external/donor financing out of which UGX.630,174,440 (96 %), |  
|^|<|<| was receivedThe Accounting Officer explained that External |  
|^|<|<| Financing performed very well up to 96% and all planned |  
|^|<|<| activities were implemented as planned. The difference of only |  
|^|<|<| 4% has had no impact the implementation of the planned |  
|^|<|<| activities |  
|^|<|<|  Out of the total receipts for the financial year of |  
|^|<|<| UGX.27,315,767,447, UGX.42,423,071,166 (92%) was spent by |  
|^|<|<| the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. |  
|^|<|<| 22,056,617,661 (81%). The unspent balance at the end of the |  
|^|<|<| financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated |  
|^|<|<| fund account. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that |  
|^|<|<| funds for these activities are in subsequent year un implemented |  
|^|<|<| activities rolled over and subsequently ensure the speedy |  
|^|<|<| implementation. |  
|^|<|<|  I noted that the District received a total of UGX.22,103,714 as |  
|^|<|<| capitation grant. I reviewed the bank statements sampled |  
|^|<|<| schools and noted that the funds were still on the school |  
|^|<|<| accounts by 30th September, 2021 and had hence not been |  
|^|<|<| utilized. I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with relevant |  
|^|<|<| authorities and ensure that these funds are put to productive |  
|^|<|<| usage. |  
| I reviewed funds absorption and noted that UGX.12.35 billion (81.78%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.15.1 billion, resulting in an unabsorbed balance of UGX.2.75 billion.

using wrong salary scales, leading to under payments of UGX 0.932 million, contrary to Section B–a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.

- I noted that UGX.20,116,483 was paid to 12 staff who had either retired, transferred, absconded or died. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure prompt removal of staff from the payroll.

- I noted that whereas UGX.3,328,551,409 was deducted from employees’ salaries to be remitted to different beneficiaries, UGX.3,319,064,736 was remitted, leading to an over and/or under remittance amounting to UGX.7,357,520 and UGX 6,415,791 respectively. The Accounting Officer explained that the underpayment would be paid during subsequent remittances.

- I noted that the District made unauthorized loan deductions totaling UGX 680 million. The deductions were from 461 employees that neither had letters of undertaking nor existed in the “active deduction” or the “my approval” reports on the PDMS-Payroll Deduction Management System, operated by PCA- Payroll Consults Africa.

- I noted that 13 newly recruited/ transferred employees delayed to access payroll, with delays ranging between 1-2 months. Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears.

- I noted that one pensioner; Okenga Abedican delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays of 31 days. Delayed access to the pension payroll leads to poor wellbeing of the affected retirees as well as accumulation of pension arrears.

- I observed that there were variances of UGX.263,261,431 between the figures in the MoPS IPPS and district payroll registers. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the district IPPS payroll registers are consistent with MoPS payroll data.

- Included in the Statement of Financial Position on page 7 of the Financial Statements are receivables worth UGX.485,694,634 as supported by Note 19 to the financial statements. The amount for the previous financial year was UGX.193,836,559. The amounts relate to advances to Youth and Women Interest groups. I advised the Accounting Officer to continue sensitizing Youth Interest Groups and women groups to recover the funds.

- I noted that the District had deposits worth UGX.396,301,510 presented in the Statement of Financial Position and disclosed in note 25 to the financial statements. The figure increased by UGX.4,000,000 from UGX.394,301,510 which were recoveries of the Youth Livelihood Programme (YLP) as recommended by Inspectorate of Government.

- I noted that though the district had prepared the Strategic plan,

402

it was still in draft form at the time of audit and certification from NPA had not been obtained. I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with NPA to expedite the process of reviewing and approval the Strategic Plan of the District.

- I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX.1,040,800,000 during the year but collected UGX.296,535,563 representing (29%) performance. The shortfalls in Local Revenue collections of UGX.744,264,437 (71%) were recorded in Local Service Tax, Land Fees , Business Licence, other tax revenues, administrative fees and Application Fees.

- The District budgeted to receive UGX. 1,426,989,000 as external/donor financing out of which UGX.1,304,944 (0.09%), was received.

- Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.28,843,895,403, UGX.25,055,771,226 (97%) was spent by the district resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.3,788,124,204. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.

- I noted that the district prepared annual monitoring plans dated 02/08/2021, but had not been submitted to MoFPED, MoLG and NPA as required by the time of audit (10/09/2021). Further, the district had not also submitted quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED as required by the time of audit (10/09/2021). This practice is not only in contravention of the circular instructions but also hinders efforts of timely monitoring of the implementation of the budget.

- I noted that management submitted performance reports for Q1 and Q2 in time while performance reports for Q3 and Q4 were submitted after deadline given for submission of the reports.

- In addition, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which are important in ensuring that the budget performs as expected.

- I noted delayed completion of Construction of Atyak Seed Secondary School under the UGIFT project, A joint supervision report dated 18/5/2021 was reviewed and put the work so far done at only 66% and cumulative total payments had been made of UGX 1,365,729,024 ( representing 65% of the contract sum) by end of year. By the time of the audit in September 2021, about 5% of the works were still incomplete yet the contract had long expired.

- I noted that the District received a total of UGX.154,269,648. I reviewed the bank statements for sampled schools and noted that the funds were still on the schools’ accounts by 30th

|^|^|<|  A review of the pension payroll data and IFMS payments, |  
|^|^|<| revealed variances between amounts on the payroll and |

|^|^|<| UGX.87,774,282 contrary to article 254 (1) & (3) of the 1995 |  
|^|^|<| constitution (as amended). The over payment of pension and |  
|^|^|<| gratuity led to over statement of pension expenditure. |  
|^|^|<|  A comparison of base pay in the IPPS payroll registers with the |  
|^|^|<| salary structure for the financial year 2020/21, revealed that 51 |  
|^|^|<| staff were paid using appropriate salary scale but wrong band |  
|^|^|<| contrary to Section B–a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service |  
|^|^|<| Standing Orders, 2010. The Accounting Officer promised to |  
|^|^|<| address it through monthly verification of the payroll. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that UGX.11,772,809 was paid to 9 staff who had either |  
|^|^|<| retired, transferred, absconded or died. These were payment for |  
|^|^|<| services not rendered to the District resulting in loss of funds to |  
|^|^|<| Government. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure prompt |  
|^|^|<| removal of ineligible staff from the payroll. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted that whereas UGX.4,904,248,620 was deducted from |  
|^|^|<| employees’ salaries to be remitted to different beneficiaries, |  
|^|^|<| UGX.4,898,616,110 was remitted, leading to an under remittance |

|^|^|<| that all deductions to UCLA/UBA are remitted concurrently with |  
|^|^|<| salary payments. |  
|^|^|<|  I noted delays in the remittance of PAYE deductions to URA of 3 |

|^|^|<| leading to an under deduction of UGX.10,970,580, contrary to |

computing PAYE.

- I noted that 20 pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays ranging between 4.5 months. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that pensioners promptly access the payroll and are subsequently paid.

- I noted that 16 employees were paid a total of UGX.52 million without signed pay change reports. This affects the integrity/credibility of the payroll and creates an avenue for payroll abuse.

- I noted that the District did not prepare monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis and thus did not submit quarterly returns on payroll to MoPS, contrary to Paragraph 2.1 of Establishment Notice No. 1 of 2020. The Accounting Officer took note of the observation and stated that action has been initiated during Q1 of the FY 2021/22.

- A comparison of the payroll register and IFMS payment file, I noted that 3 pensioners were paid a total of UGX.75,420,453 off the IPPS. The Accounting Officer explained that Pension and gratuity arrears had their schedule of payment; therefore, they would not be paid through IPPS.

- I noted that the district had not prepared and approved a strategic plan that is aligned to the NDP-III at the time of audit. I advise Management to urgently prepare and have approved a strategic plan that is aligned to NDP-III to facilitate the achievement of the NDP objectives.

- I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX. 663,494,100 during the year but collected UGX.445,457,586 representing (67%) performance. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that NTR is collected as budgeted.

- The District budgeted to receive UGX.54,077,677,212 (revised) as grants from the Treasury. I noted that, UGX.48,328,375,344 was warranted/ received representing 89% performance.

- The District budgeted to receive UGX.38,231,319,640 as transfers from other Government Units. However, only UGX.23,692,222,658 (62%) was received.

As a result, the pay roll analysis for Terego District was made under the audit of Arua DLG. I, noted that although the district aligned its targets for the F/Y 2020/2021 with the DDPIII and NDPIII, the District strategic plan had not been approved. I advised the Accounting Officer to urgently prepare and approved a strategic plan that is aligned to NDP-III to facilitate the achievement of the NDP objectives I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX. 116,717,055 during the year but collected UGX.89,153,132 representing (76%) performance.

| of the financial year 2020/2021 their Budget release was only for the six months thus explaining the poor performance.  Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX. 6.5Bn, UGX. 5.9Bn (91%) was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.6 Bn (91%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. The funds were meant for activities that were not fully implemented by the end of the financial year and these include Salaries worth UGX.475,796,820.  During field Inspection carried out on service delivery areas at Yinga HC III, I observed the following;   Fridge for storage of blood donated by IRC and UNICEF was not installed consequently, cases of anaemia are referred to other facilities;   Motorised borehole that was installed by OXFAM had been  disconnected for six months;  the piped water system installed at the facility had broken down for the period of six months;   As per interview of in-charge of the facility, the facility had not been supplied drugs for two quarters leading to drug stock-outs. This led to the referral of cases that would have been handled at the facility;  The generator that was donated to the HC has never been installed during the two years it has been at the facility I reviewed of the governance structures of Terego DLG and noted that the district did not have a District Land Board in place. Consequently, the institutional land of the district was not titled. Further, there were reports of land disputes as seen in the Council Minutes dated 21st May 2021. I reviewed the execution of the annual procurement plan of Terego district for the year under review revealed that projects worth UGX.740,372,862 were not executed in the year, hence hindering service delivery to the intended beneficiaries. I reviewed the implementation of the DRDIP project in the district and observed that 16 beneficiary projects funded to the tune of UGX.1,620,066,939 had not yet been implemented. The Accounting Officer promised immediate action. I await the outcome of the Accounting Officers action.    |<|<|<|

- I noted that whereas UGX.4,339,048,878 was deducted from employees’ salaries to be remitted to different beneficiaries only, UGX.4,333,222,745 was remitted, leading to an over remittance of UGX.4,849,344 and under remittance of UGX.10,675,477.

- I noted that the District made unauthorized loan deductions totaling UGX.87,617,577. The deductions were from 78 employees that neither had letters of undertaking nor existed in the “active deduction” or the “my approval” reports on the PDMS-Payroll Deduction Management System, operated by PCA- Payroll Consults Africa.

- I compared the loan deductions in June 2021 on the IPPS payroll against the active deductions amounts on the Payroll Consults Africa (PCA) system and discovered that there were 160 instances where the amount on IPPS being deducted is either more or less than the amount on the active deductions implying that there is a weakness in the system of loan deductions where many employees are either over paying for loans they picked or are underpaying.

- In a sample of 14 teachers selected, I noted that the district/votes were not affecting annual salary increments on employee salaries. This may lead to demotivation of staff.

- I noted that the district had not yet prepared a strategic plan at the time of audit, I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the strategic plan is implemented upon approval.

- I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the strategic plan is implemented upon approval. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that NTR is collected as budgeted. The district budgeted to receive UGX.6, 748,502,080 as transfers from other Government Units. However, only UGX.1,325,146,185 (20%) was received. Revenue shortfalls affected the implementation of planned activities.

- The district budgeted to receive UGX.2,213,127,500 as external/donor financing, out of which UGX.261,434,917 (12%), was received. Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities.

- District failed spent fund balance of UGX.681, 679,315 meant for Start of construction of Ndhew Seed Secondary School, Drilling of boreholes, and Payment of gratuity.

- I noted that the district submitted performance reports for all the quarters after the deadlines given for submission of the reports, In addition, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which

I further noted that there was an under payment of UGX.32,297,600 as well. The Accounting Officer acknowledged the shortcoming and promised future action.   A comparison of base pay in the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) payroll registers with the salary structure for 2020/21, revealed that 6 staff were paid using wrong salary scales, leading to over payments of UGX.3,190,260 contrary to Section B–a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.

- The merger of both IPPS and NIRA system have not been fully done in that when there is a system error each entity has to clear an error in its jurisdiction thus time consuming and affecting timely service delivery.

- The system has not been fully decentralized to the extent that system errors under Employee verification system (issues) with NIRA have to be handled at the Headquarter and this contributes to multiple negative factors such delayed clearance of technical issues at least a period of three month or more.

- I noted that although the entity had prepared a strategic plan, at the time of audit, it had not yet been approved as aligned to the NDP-III.
