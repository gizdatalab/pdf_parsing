donor funds, NTR, Government units releases from Government & other  The Municipality mischarged expenditure worth UGX.5,244,093 on wrong budget lines other than those prescribed for salary, pension or gratuity The Municipal’s strategic plan was not approved by the National Planning Authority at the time of audit and therefore I could not confirm that it is aligned to NDP-III. The Municipality lacked certificates of title for 13 pieces of land. I noted that the MC did not have sufficient waste receptacles and solid waste collection vehicles which have led to piling of garbage on the Municipality streets resulting into a public health nuisance.   ;;;
