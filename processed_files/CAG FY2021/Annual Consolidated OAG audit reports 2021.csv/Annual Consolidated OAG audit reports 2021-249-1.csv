management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery.  ;;;

Management failed to collect tuition fees and accumulated receivables to the tune of UGX.460Mn by close of the financial year, with some debts dating as far back as 2014. I observed that some students who had not cleared fees had completed their studies, graduated and even obtained their certificates rendering such receivables uncollectible. I noted that the entity had prepared a new strategic plan, but had no proof of certification and approval of its plan by NPA. Management explained that the exercise was interrupted by Covid-19 Lock down and closure of schools. Out of 175 approved posts for the Institute, only 127 were filled, resulting into a staffing gap of forty-eight (48) positions. Furthermore, seven (7) positions were filled by staff in an acting capacity including the Position of the Principal. Staffing gaps limit the Institute’s ability to effectively deliver the intended services.    Uganda Hotel and Tourism Training Institute (UHTII) 2020/21 Unqualified 1 Opinion;;;
