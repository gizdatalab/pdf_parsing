Out of the planned 7 strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, 2 outputs/targets had been fully achieved while 5 were partially achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.2.56Bn representing 17.3% performance. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.7.624Bn, UGX.9.11Bn was spent by the entity resulting into an over absorption of UGX.1.48Bn representing an absorption level of 119%. I sampled 5 outputs with a total of 30 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.7.07Bn and observed that 4 outputs with a total of 18 activities and expenditure worth UGX.6.69Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with a total of 12 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.39Bn was insufficiently quantified. For the 5 fully quantified outputs, 2 outputs with 2 activities worth UGX.2.55Bn were fully implemented while 3 outputs with 28 activities worth UGX.4.09Bn were partially implemented. Funds to the tune of USD.17,382.29 (equivalent to UGX.64,841,678) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 after the deadline given for submission. I noted some cases of material inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the level of performance reported. UGX.328,779,539 reported as cash in transit has been in the books of the Embassy for more than three financial years and the funds have never been credited to the Consolidated Fund. The Mission had total collections including balance brought forward from previous year of UGX.884,552,695out of which UGX.180,503,771 had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.704,048,924 not remitted. The Embassy paid USD.25,000.00 (equivalent to UGX.93,258,250) in respect of education allowances direct to its officials instead of their respective education institutions or schools contrary to Section (E - e) Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010. USD.1,613.00 (equivalent to UGX.6,017,022) out of which USD.1,076.00 (equivalent to UGX.4,013,835) representing 2/3 of the amount should have been recovered from the respective staff was incurred on the payments for telephone bills during the period. The recovery was not effected. Out of an approved staff structure of 6 staff positions for the Mission, 5 (83%) were filled leaving 1(17%) vacant. Qualified Opinion;;;
