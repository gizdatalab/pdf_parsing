;;;renewed their licenses in the year under review 2020/2021 revealed that

        I noted that MDAs and LGs are still experiencing challenges in implementing the budgets approved by parliament and policy guidance’s issued by PS/ST, which has continued to affect the performance and credibility of the budget negatively. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2,572,820,000 during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.1,410,970,500 was collected, representing a performance of 55% of the target, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1,161,849,500. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.2.572Bn during the period, out of which UGX.1.383Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.189Bn which is 46.23% of the budget. I observed that in cases where outputs were not quantified, management reported performance in generic ways such as tenants sensitised to pay rent, court attended etc, without specifying the number/quantities achieved. All five (5) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.1.383Bn were partially implemented. I noted that in a twist of events, the Board refunded the sum of UGX.0.860Bn that had been deposited in respect of the property, citing the fact that the property had been donated to the tenant, but this was not supported by a Board resolution. I observed that according to a disclosure in note 19 of the accounts, receivables have increased from UGX.3.35Bn last year to UGX.8.21Bn this year. Of this amount, UGX.3,73Bn relates to uncollected rent from prior years and UGX.4.60Bn relates to unpaid proceeds from property sales. I reviewed the portfolio of DAPCB court cases and noted that there was a continuous rise) in the number of court cases against the Board arising from disputes of properties. The cases rose by 18, making a total of 120, as at the end of the year. 15 The Departed Asians Property Custodian Board (DAPCB). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
