;;;(2) outputs (5%) were fully quantified, two (2) outputs (5%) were

      The Project budgeted to receive UGX.8.7Bn from GOU out of which UGX.1.9Bn was released representing 21.8% of the budget leaving a balance of UGX.6.8Bn as unreleased. Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX.139.7Bn from World Bank however only UGX.125.2Bn (90%) was availed. UGX.49.9Bn remained un-utilized at the end of the financial year. Out of the four (4) outputs reviewed, only one (1) output (25%) was fully quantified. Three (3) outputs were not quantified at all. I observed that management did not prepare performance reports that show the status of implementation of planned outputs. I noted that there was slow progress of works, delayed relocation of utilities and delayed land aquistion which resulted in delayed service delivery. I also noted that UGX.1,323,171,260 that was garnished had not yet been refunded by Government through KCCA. I noted that ownership of one hundred forty-seven (147) pieces of land on which project roads and drainages had been constructed had not yet been transferred to KCCA. 13 Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (KIIDP). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
