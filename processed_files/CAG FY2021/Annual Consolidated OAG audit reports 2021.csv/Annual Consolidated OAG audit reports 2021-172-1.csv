three (3) were not achieved at all. Management created an additional position of “Principal Director” to oversee the Directorates of Flight operations and Maintenance which is not in the established structure and is contrary to The Civil Aviation Regulations 2014, section 13. UACC is a statutory corporation that is supposed to undertake procurements in accordance with PPDA Law and its Regulations. I observed that procurements are normally undertaken as and when the aircrafts breakdown and as such did not follow the formal procurement procedures. UACC signed a contract on 20th April, 2021 with National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) for construction of the UACC HQ offices for a sum of UGX.1.097Bn and the expected project completion date was 19th October, 2021. I observed that unsecured advances of UGX.1.04Bn (95%) of the contract sum had been paid to NEC by closure of the financial year 30th June 2021. Audit inspection carried out on 18th October, 2021 observed that construction works were behind schedule. UACC to-date does not have an operating Aircraft to do business since most of them had been grounded or not operational under different circumstances. The Corporation had negative retained earnings/revenue reserves of UGX.24.03Bn as at the end of the financial year. This may affect the entity’s ability to meet future contingencies or investments in growth.     ;;;
