Out of the total warrants of UGX.18.8Bn received during the financial year, UGX. 18.3Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.5Bn (representing an absorption level of 97.3%).

Out of the ten (10) outputs selected for budget performance assessment with a total of twenty four (24) activities and expenditure of UGX 12.16bn, I noted that seven (7) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure worth UGX 9.99bn were fully quantified. Two (2) outputs with a total of eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX 1.9Bn, was insufficiently quantified.

Inspection of the hospital drug some drugs/chemicals had expired in the Hospital stores. This could have been due to low utilization rates, receipt of drugs with short shelf life or placement of orders that do not match the usage patterns. stores revealed that I noted that 55 new recruits were not cleared by Ministry of Public Service as required.
