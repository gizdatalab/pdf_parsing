"I noted that at the close of the financial year 2020/2021, out of the two (2) planned strategic targets/objectives, one objective/goal had been achieved, while the other one had been partially achieved. Out of the budgeted amount of UGX.58.82Bn budgeted to be received from World Bank during the financial year 2020/2021; a sum of UGX.46.53Bn was received indicating performance of 79% of the target. Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX.1.25Bn, of which UGX.1.07Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX. 0.18 Bn (14.4%) of the budget. I noted that all project outputs were fully quantified. I also noted that the project fully implemented one of the sampled outputs, partially implemented one and two outputs were not implemented.
