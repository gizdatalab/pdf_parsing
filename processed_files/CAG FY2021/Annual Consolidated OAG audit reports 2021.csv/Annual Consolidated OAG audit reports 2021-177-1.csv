;;;Covid-19.
;;; The Ministry delayed submitting all its quarterly performance reports to
;;;MoFPED, and similarly, I did not find evidence to confirm that monitoring
;;;plans and reports were prepared.
;;; I observed that a number of government entities had not been filling
;;;positions of persons who had been granted leave without pay, which
;;;resulted in manpower gaps in these entities affecting their efficiency in
;;;delivering services to the citizens.
;;; The Ministry failed to utilise up to UGX.6.5Bn of the total salary budget of
;;;UGX.17.9Bn provided by MoFPED over the past four (4) years.
;;; The Ministry had outstanding domestic arrears of UGX 0.86Bn by the end
;;;of the financial year.
;;; The Ministry had not put in place adequate guidance regarding the
;;;number of boards on which a civil servant is allowed to serve at any one
;;;time. This resulted in some civil servants serving on more than three (3)
;;;boards, which affects the time they allocate to their substantive jobs.
;;; I noted some challenges in the management of recruitments into the
;;;"service, such as; irregular employment of staff by Accounting Officers and"
;;;the absence of a policy for the recruitment and selection of temporary
;;;staff.
;;; I noted irregularities in the management of leave without pay for civil
;;;"servants, which included; absence of a complete register of all civil"
;;;servants who were away on leave without pay and irregular grant of
;;;leave without pay.
;;; I noted irregularities in overseas training for civil servants, such as the
;;;absence of a register of all civil servants who were away on training and
;;;some Officers who went abroad for training programmes offered by the
;;;different local universities in Uganda.
      I noted that the Commission did not have an approved strategic plan that was aligned to NDP III by the time of audit. The draft plan prepared by the entity had not been certified by NPA. The Commission collected only 0.03% of its NTR target for the year and had a shortfall in government funding of 0.04Bn which is 0.75% of the budget. The Commission absorbed all the funds that were released. Out of the five (5) out-puts assessed, one (1) output with 0.115 Bn was fully quantified, while four (4) outputs with 4.01Bn were insufficiently quantified. The one (1) output that was fully quantified was partially implemented. The Commission neither prepared annual budget monitoring plans nor submitted quarterly budget monitoring reports. The Commission also failed to submit all its quarterly budget performance reports in time. The Commission failed to coordinate the automation of revenue management systems. There are currently four (4) revenue management systems used by various Local Governments which are implemented in a disjointed and uncoordinated manner. This has resulted in duplication of activities associated with running these systems thus affecting service delivery. The Commission received UGX.182,000,000 as budget support to undertake physical decentralization and service delivery. However only UGX.31,241,000 was absorbed by the Commission which significantly 3. Local Government Finance Commission 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
