I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with line Ministries to revote the funds, the activities and ensure they are subsequently implemented. roll over a) Absorption of released funds Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX 4,328.01 Bn, UGX 4,147.90 Bn (95.8%) was spent by the Local Governments resulting in an unspent balance of UGX 180.11 Bn (4.2%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was remitted back to the consolidated fund account. Under absorption of released funds results in non- implementation of planned activities and negates the purpose for which funds were disbursed, thereby affecting the achievement of the objectives in the NDPIII. For example, implementation of USMID projects in Municipal Councils and UgIFT projects in DLGs was not undertaken. The Accounting Officers attributed failure to utilise funds to COVID-19 which affected the recruitment exercise, late release of USMID funds and delays in the procurement process and lotting policy of contract works under UgIFT. 2.1;;;;;;

ii) Revenue from External financing The Local Governments budgeted to receive UGX 413.94 Bn as external/donor financing, out of which UGX 57 Bn (13.8%), was received Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities.
