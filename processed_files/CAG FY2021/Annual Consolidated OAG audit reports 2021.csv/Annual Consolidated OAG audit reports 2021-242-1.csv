I noted that all four components did not fully absorb the available funds. Out of the UGX.104.88Bn that was released to RCIP, the Project only utilised UGX.76.52Bn, thus failing to absorb funds to a tune of UGX.28.36Bn representing 27% of the released funds. It was noted that RCIP set clear performance targets and indicators for some activities to facilitate performance measurement.

4;National Information Technology Authority – Uganda (NITA-U) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;; Analysis of domestic arrears over the past three years has shown a steep upward trend over the period with a 123% growth. The outstanding amount currently is UGX.6Bn. Further analysis revealed that most of the arrears relate to costs of expanding the national backbone infrastructure. The domestic arrears at hand now account for 14% of the annual GoU budget of the Authority.

"  Although the entity budgeted to receive UGX.45.83Bn only UGX.15.39Bn was collected and spent, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.30.43Bn which is 66.4% of the budget. The budget for the financial year 2020/2021 was developed on the assumption that UBC would receive the UGX.34.6 Billion approved by Parliament; however, the Corporation did not receive the funds as planned. This is an indication of unrealistic budgeting by the Corporation well aware of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic Comparison of the trade receivables balances for current year and prior year indicates that the receivables decreased by 28% from UGX.30.79Bn to UGX.22Bn.
