"JCRC reported trade and other receivables of UGX.4,210,400,000. Out of this UGX.95,254,972 related to the previous financial year. I noted that JCRC did not make any provision for bad debts as required by IFRS 9 and its Manual. Failure to make provisions may result into overstating reported receivables due to unaccounted for risks of non-recoverability. In addition, there was no evidence from the Finance Committee that a review of the bad debts position was annually done. Management explained that in addition to sending out constant reminders to the listed debtors, Management would review the list further for presentation to the Finance Committee of the Board. I advised the Accounting officer to make the required provisions for bad debts in accordance with Standards and the Manual I noted that JCRC signed contracts with local service providers in foreign currency to a tune of USD 32,258.7. The contracts were for supply of Bone density kits (USD 25,515); supply of Hematology reagents (USD 2,060), and; for internet services (USD 4,683).
