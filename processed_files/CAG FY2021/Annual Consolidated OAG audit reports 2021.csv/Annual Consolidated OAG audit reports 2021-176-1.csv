"     There was a shortfall in releases from GOU sources of UGX.0.23Bn and donors of UGX.19.763Bn. Furthermore, the project failed to absorb UGX.0.271Bn. I reviewed 4 out-puts with a total of 16 activities worth UGX.57.7Bn representing 100% of the total expenditure and noted that two (2) outputs with six (6) activities worth UGX.38.6Bn were fully quantified.
