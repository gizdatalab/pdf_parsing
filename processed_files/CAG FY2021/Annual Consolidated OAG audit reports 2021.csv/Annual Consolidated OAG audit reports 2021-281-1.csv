;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.22.165 Bn,
;;;UGX.22.160 Bn was spent by the entity resulting into an under absorption
;;;of UGX.0.006 Bn representing an absorption level of 99.97%.

;;;and expenditure of UGX.22.059 Bn taken for assessment, six (6) outputs
;;;with a total of thirteen (13) activities and expenditure worth UGX.18.708
;;;Bn were fully quantified.
;;; I assessed the implementation of six (6) out puts that were fully
;;;quantified with a total of thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.18.708Bn and
;;;noted that five (5) outputs with a total of twelve (12) activities worth
;;;UGX.18.708Bn were partially implemented. Out of the twelve (12)
;;;"activities, the entity fully implemented five (5) activities (42%); partially"
;;;implemented three (3) activities (25%) and four (4) activities (33%)
;;;remained unimplemented.
;;; A review of the strategic plan, budgets and other records revealed that
;;;Council does not have a policy in place for promoting sports. There was
;;;no evidence availed by management to show that there is any framework
;;;of relationship with Local authorities to provide sports facilities.
;;; Whereas Council approved funds transfer of UGX.1,431,284,198 to
;;;various Associations, there was no evidence to show that Council
;;;approved budgets of the individual Associations as required by NCS
;;;Regulations. I further noted that the approved funds transfers lacked a
;;;schedule supporting the allocation break down.
;;; Out of the 51 registered Associations, 49 submitted information about
;;;their other sources of funding. The remaining 2 Associations did not
;;;submit the required information for the period under review.
;;; I noted that some Associations did not deduct and remit WHT totalling to
;;;UGX.21,636,694 to the Uganda Revenue Authority.
    I noted that the Institute budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.25.68Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.9.11Bn was collected, representing a performance of 35.5% of the target. In addition, the Institute budgeted to receive UGX.36.33Bn however, UGX.33.89Bn was availed, resulting in a deficit of UGX.2.44 Bn which is 6.7% of the budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.33.88Bn received during the financial year. UGX.29.25Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.4.63Bn, thus an absorption level of 86.33%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA. I further noted that the entity did not seek a revision of its budget and work plan as provided for by section 17 (3) of the PFMA 2015. I noted that the University received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX.185,595,654 which was not declared to treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities for a sample of twelve (12) outputs with a total of sixty-eight (68) activities and expenditure of UGX.35.32Bn and noted that all the twelve (12) outputs with a total of sixty-eight (68) activities and expenditure worth UGX 35.32Bn were not quantified at all. That is, all the sixty-eight (68) activities (100%) within these outputs were not clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance.  I noted that PAYE tax totaling to UGX.589,262,089 was not deducted 16 Uganda Management Institute (UMI). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
