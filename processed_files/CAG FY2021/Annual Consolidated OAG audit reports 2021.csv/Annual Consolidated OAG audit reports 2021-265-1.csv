This was due to power losses attributed to absence of transmission lines to evacuate electricity from PA Technical, Siti 1 and Arpe Power Plants, as a result of wheeling power over a lower capacity and weaker distribution lines operated by UEDCL. The long outstanding receivable resulting from payment of former UEB pension costs of UGX.38.6Bn by UEDCL which has never been paid back to the Company by MoFPED. Failed to meet its targeted annual connection 37,293 of customers whereby only 6,309 (16.9%) connections were made. I noted that in the FY 2020/21, the approved energy loss target by the Electricity Regulatory Authority was at 20.1%. I however noted from the Grid Energy Reports submitted to ERA, that the Company was unable to meet its target energy losses and most of its service territories registered an average of 32.7% power losses. I noted non -compliance by the WENRECO to the terms of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement, such as provision of semi-annual reports on status of the assets, safe storage of UEDCL connection materials, participation in the physical network inspection, submission of asset modifications register among others. The 62,944 poles leased to UMEME by UEDCL were damaged and required replacement which was not done contrary to the provisions of the Lease Agreement. Unqualified;;;

18;Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) 2020/21;; I noted that UETCL developed and approved a Corporate Business Plan without certification from the National Planning Authority. There is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the achievement of NDP- III objectives.
