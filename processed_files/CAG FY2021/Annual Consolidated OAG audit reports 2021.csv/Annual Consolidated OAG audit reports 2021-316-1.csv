The Sessional Parliamentary Committee on Social services recommended the granting of a vote status to the Organization. This was followed by issuance of statutory instruments and the gazetting and commencement of the Uganda National Health Research Organisation Act, 2011 on the 22nd day of January 2016. However, I noted that the Organization had not been granted a vote status by the time of audit. I noted that the Organization did not have a governing Board during the year under review, after the term of office for all former members of the Board expired in 2016. The employment contract on file for the Director General expired in April 2018 and had not been renewed by the time of audit. Only 12 out of the approved 26 positions in the Organizational Structure had been filled resulting into a staffing gap of 14 positions. The Organization was financed by a subvention of only UGX.240m out of which 94% was earmarked for wage leaving only 6% for operational costs.      18 Uganda National Health Research Organization.
