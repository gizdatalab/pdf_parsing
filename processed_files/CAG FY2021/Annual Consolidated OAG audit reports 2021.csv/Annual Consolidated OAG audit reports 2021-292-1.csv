"I noted that the University prepared a strategic plan and obtained a certificate of compliance on the 27th of September 2021 from National planning Authority (NPA). The University collected UGX.40.9Bn (53%) of its budgeted non-tax revenue of UGX.77.1Bn. I further noted that the university received UGX.130.07Bn (93%) out of the budgeted GOU receipts amount of UGX.140.6Bn. Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.130.07Bn, only UGX.124.5 was spent by the University resulting into unspent balance of UGX.5.53Bn representing an absorption level of 96%. The University received Donor financing to the tune of UGX.3.11Bn of which only UGX.2.68Bn had been included in the budget reflecting off budget receipts of UGX.0.43Bn. I noted that out of the 14 outputs sampled, 4 out puts (29%) were fully quantified, 8 out puts (57%) were insufficiently quantified while 2 out puts (14%) were not quantified at all. I also noted that the University did not fully implement any of the 4 fully quantified out puts. The University had outstanding domestic arrears and outstanding receivables of UGX.13.6Bn and UGX.23.2Bn, respectively. Some of the University land had illegal land occupants. I further noted that there were variations between the area on the Certificate of Tittle and actual Area on the ground for plot M902 of the University land. Out of the 1,671 approved posts for the University, only 928 (55.5%) were filled leaving 743 (45.5%) posts vacant. This has a negative impact on education service delivery. The University had MOUs for only 40 of the 112 affiliated Institutions. I further noted that of the 40 MOUs availed; MOUs for 9 Institutions had expired.           68 Kyambogo University 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
