"President’s Office effective July 2021. I however did not obtain evidence of a proper transition plan which has led to delayed disbursement of funding for subventions and independent projects. The merger further rendered 136 technical scientist staff redundant and were not paid emoluments by the end of November, 2021. I advised management to ensure that a smooth transition process is undertaken. Out of the total budget for the financial year of UGX.150Bn, only UGX.144.6Bn was received by the Ministry resulting into a shortfall of UGX.5.737Bn (equivalent to 3.5% of the budget). Shortfalls in revenue result into non implementation of planned activities. Out of 20 quantified activities worth UGX.105.9Bn that were assessed; 13 activities representing 65% were fully implemented, 5 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 10% were not implemented. I advised management to roll over critical activities to subsequent years and ensure that they are implemented before the end of the National Development Plan III. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.834Mn were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I advised management to always ensure that proper authorization is obtained before implementing any unbudgeted activities. Most of the research projects that had received funds for COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments had not made much progress. Delays were majorly attributed to the late disbursement of funds and delayed delivery of Equipment. I advised management to ensure thorough due diligence before funds are allocated to the projects.     Technology and Innovation. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;

5;Kiira Motors Corporation. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;Cabinet approved the roadmap for the commercialisation of the Kiira Electric vehicle project with a seed fund of UGX.143.7Bn to be availed over a period of 4 years effective 2018/19. Only 59% of the seed fund had been released in the previous three financial years, casting doubt as to whether the balance of UGX.58.4Bn (41%) would be released in the 
;;;remaining one year. Failure to promptly fund the project, may lead to
;;;high-cost overruns and delays in realising the intended objectives. In
;;;addition, it may cast doubts on its sustainability.
;;; KMC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with National
;;;Enterprise Corporation (NEC) on the 15th January 2019 for the
;;;construction of the Kiira Vehicle Plant start-up facilities at the cost of
;;;UGX.63.64Bn. I noted that of the civil works that were to be completed
;;;by June 2021 (a period of 2 years and six (6) months), only 82% of those
;;;works had been completed due to insufficient funding. Underfunding has
;;;affected the progress of the plant construction which further delays the
;;;realisation of the intended objectives.
;;; Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (represented by Kiira
;;;Motors Corporation) and Makerere University were collaborating in the
;;;Development of a Low-Cost Open Design Medical Ventilator named
;;;Bulamu, that could be manufactured locally. Although UGX.74Mn was
;;;received from Resilient Africa Network Ran Ltd towards the completion of
;;;the development of the Ventilator, the development was behind schedule.

;;;Motors Project between FY2012/13 and FY2015/16 for the construction of
;;;the Kiira Vehicle Plant Start-Up facilities in Jinja. However, the university
;;;had not released these funds for over eight years. I advised management
