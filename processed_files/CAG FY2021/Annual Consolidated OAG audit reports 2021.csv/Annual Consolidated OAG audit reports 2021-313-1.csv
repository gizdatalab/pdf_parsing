The project became effective on 16th April 2015 and was initially expected to be completed on 28th February 2020 which was later extended to 31st December 2021. However, the cumulative project progress was at 99.5% as at 30th June 2020. Major delays were identified in the procurement and installation of 

I noted that out of the two (2) planned project outputs for the year, one (1) output was fully implemented while one (1) output was partially implemented. Management attributed the level of performance to delayed commencement of the preparation of the detailed designs for the refurbishment and equipping of Busolwe General Hospital which involved approval of extra charges for the consultant to revise the site survey report. According to management, the COVID-19 pandemic further affected the operations of the Consultant. During the year under review, the Project received a sum of UGX 15.69Bn of which UGX.10.63Bn was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.5.06Bn (representing an absorption level of 67.8%).  12 Uganda-Spain Debt Swap Project. 2019/20  Unqualified Opinion;;;

The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX 1.24bn during the year under review. However, the hospital collected UGX. 1.15bn thereby resulting into a shortfall of UGX 0.09bn. The Hospital received the entire revised annual budget of UGX 17.023bn out of which UGX 16.551bn was spent resulting in unutilized funds of UGX 0.472bn. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. I noted that the entity submitted all the quarterly performance reports after the prescribed deadline. The Accounting Officer explained that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the support offices were operating at 10% which led to delays in preparation and submission of the quarterly performance reports. According to the patient admission schedule and the strategic plan, the Hospital currently handles between 750 and 780 in-patients per month compared to its bed capacity of 550 patients. This implies that 200 to 230 admitted patients either share beds or sleep on the floor. I noted that UGX.93,717,182 was utilized for repairs and service for vehicles during the year under review. However, there were no repair and service analysis registers for the 13 vehicles that were maintained. Furthermore, it was observed that the Hospital Transport Officer did not maintain service charts for all the 13 vehicles.      Unqualified 14 Butabika National Mental Referral Hospital.
