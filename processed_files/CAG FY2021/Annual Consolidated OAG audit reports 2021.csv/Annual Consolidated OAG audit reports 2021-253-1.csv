;;; Attention is drawn to Note 19 of the financial statements in which
;;;management made a provision to reduce the receivable amount from
;;;UGX.13Bn to UGX.3.2Bn given the preliminary findings by a company
;;;engaged to assess recoverability of the funds.
   Contrary to Section 45 (3) of the Public Finance and Management Act, 2015, the Board failed to implement procurements worth UGX.2.79Bn which had been indicated in their procurement plan. Unimplemented procurements signify unimplemented activities and therefore delayed service delivery. Contrary to Section 26 (4) of the PPDA 2003, procurements for stationery worth UGX.1.67Bn were concluded without carrying out market assessments. As a result, I could not establish how the estimated unit cost for these procurements was arrived at, thus implying that the procurements may have been awarded at exorbitant costs. A review of the Board's establishment structure revealed that 38 posts out of the approved 85 remained vacant during the year, indicating a 45% understaffing level. Most notable among the vacant positions are key staffs like the Director Marketing, Director Quality Assurance, Director Finance and planning, and Manager Human Resource. Inadequate staffing levels not only deprive the entity of the skills required to enhance service delivery but also frustrates segregation of duty. 11 Uganda Tourism Board. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
