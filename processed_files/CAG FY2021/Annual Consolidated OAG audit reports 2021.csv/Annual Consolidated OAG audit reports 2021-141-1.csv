"           Delays in the implementation of some project activities were noted such as provision of E-Vouchers subsidies to beneficiaries in the 12 clusters, only a total of 208,827 of beneficiaries used E-Voucher out of the targeted 400,000 and only 18 road chokes have been worked on in the 7 pilot districts against the targeted 90. The project budgeted to receive UGX 361.7Bn from development partners but only received UGX 254.8Bn, representing a performance of 70% of the budget. Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX 4Bn as GOU counterpart funding but only received UGX 2.6Bn (66%) resulting in a shortfall of UGX 1.4Bn which is 34% of the budget. Out the releases of funds of UGX 254.8Bn, the project remained with unspent balance of UGX 99.1Bn representing an absorption level of 61%. I sampled 12 outputs with a total of 25 activities worth UGX.324.1Bn representing 90% of the total budget and noted that 8 outputs with 17 activities worth UGX 53.7Bn were not quantified to enable measurement of performance. Furthermore, of the 4 outputs with a total of (8) quantified activities worth UGX 80.14Bn assessed; 1 output with 1 activity representing 25% was fully implemented while 3 outputs with a total of 7 activities representing 75% were partially implemented. The budget for the financial year 2020/21 was approved on 13th August 2020 (2 months into the financial year). Project funds to the tune of UGX 3.5Bn were disbursed significantly late to the districts. National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) held only one meeting as opposed to two recommended in a year. Procurements for rehabilitation of identified and approved road chokes/work in the last 29 roll-out districts had not commenced by the time of audit despite MAAIF budgeting for the activity at UGX 90Bn. Shortcomings were observed with the E-Voucher Management Agency which included, frequent breakdown of the system, lesser enrolment of beneficiaries ie 64% of the target, only 44% of the project beneficiaries were trained in Financial Literacy and Input use, the system was at 78% of requirement, system installation, configuration, optimisation and commissioning reports have not been submitted. its functional MAAIF budgeted UGX.104.9Bn to provide Electronic Voucher subsidies to 293,500 beneficiaries in 12 project clusters but only managed 118,933 (41%) beneficiaries. Farmers still had challenges in transacting using the system, managing farmer savings and use of inputs via the system. During the financial years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, 52,089 transactions were made by users who had never logged onto the system and were accessing inputs manually. Relatedly, 2,873 user IDs initiated 7,878 payment requests 1. Agriculture Cluster Development Project (ACDP). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;
