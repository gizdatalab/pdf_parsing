I noted that the Commission submitted a draft strategic plan to NPA for approval. The Commission budgeted for NTR of UGX.4.5bn for the financial year 2020/21, however only UGX. 788,000 was collected representing performance of 0.02% of the target. The Commission absorbed 95.7% of the funds that were released. Out of the fifteen (15) outputs sampled, ten (10) were fully quantified, while one (1) was insufficiently quantified and two (2) were not quantified at all. Out of the ten (10) outputs assessed, five (5) were fully implemented while five (5) were partially implemented. The Commission neither prepared annual budget monitoring plans nor submitted quarterly budget monitoring reports. The Commission also failed to submit all its quarterly budget performance reports in time. Out of the approved 143 staff positions, ninety-seven (97) positions were filled while forty-seven (47) positions were vacant. The commission did not remit to URA PAYE of UGX.138,219,093.        6 Judicial Service Commission 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
