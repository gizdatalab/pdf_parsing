"    URA operated at least six operations bank accounts in commercial banks with an annual turnover of over UGX.1.1 Tn, in contravention of Section 33 (5), (6) and (7) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015. The action overrides the Government financial management controls and distorts the monetary policy. UGX.9.6Bn was advanced to staff through their bank accounts to purchase goods, services, and other activities without following regulations. The practice is irregular and also exposes Government funds to a risk loss through misuse. UGX.1.16Bn paid through mobile money to various suppliers for the provision of services were not adequately supported with accountability documents as required; as a result, I could not ascertain whether the funds were utilised correctly for the intended activities. Management made cash withdrawals amounting to UGX.5.2Bn during the year, contrary to Section 11 of PFMA 2015, as well as Section 7 of the URA Cash Policy that sets the maximum insurable cash limit to UGX.20Mn. The practice has been recurring and exposes government funds to a risk of misuse of cash and loss. Unqualified 3 URA Corporate 2020/21 Opinion";;;
