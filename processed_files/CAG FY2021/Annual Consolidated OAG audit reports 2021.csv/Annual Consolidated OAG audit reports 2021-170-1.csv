The increasing trend of payables could result into an uncontrollable level of payables which greatly affects the credit worthiness of the entity. The Corporation had negative retained earnings of UGX.88,435,269 as at the end of the financial year. This may affect the entity’s ability to meet future contingencies or investments in growth. The Corporation had a current ratio of 2.3 for the year under review which is above the desirable ratio of 1.5. The high current ratio implies that the Corporation is not efficiently using its current assets or its short term financing facilities. The Corporation had a debt ratio of 53.5% as at the end of the financial year under review which is considered undesirable. This implies that the company does not have enough funds to meet its current debt obligations and may find it hard to pay a return on Government investment. 10 NATIONAL ENTERPRISE UZIMA LTD, 2020/2021 Unqualified Opinion;;;
