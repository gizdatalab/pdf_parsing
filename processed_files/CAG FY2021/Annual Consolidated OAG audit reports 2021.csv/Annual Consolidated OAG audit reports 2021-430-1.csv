;;;
;;; I noted that 29 employees were paid a total of UGX.51,348,377
;;;without signed pay change reports.
;;;
;;; I noted that 1,302 staff was paid a total of UGX. 3,048,993,948
;;;off the IPPS that arose from wrong coding of Arua DLG staff
;;;under Madi-Okollo DLG payroll arising from the separation of the
;;;payroll following the creation of Madi-Okollo district.
;;;
;;; The budget of Arua DLG was not adjusted/collapsed following
;;;the issuance of the supplementary budgets to the new local
;;;governments. Consequently, the budget of Arua DLG for the year
;;;under review is unrealistic. Further, activities meant to be
;;;undertaken by the new local governments were undertaken by
;;;Arua DLG for example the payment of general staff salaries
;;;totaling UGX.6,397,754,797 for Terego DLG staff and
;;;UGX.8,348,159,119 for Arua city staff. This distorts the budget
;;;performance measurement for the local governments involved.
;;;
;;; I noted underperformance of revenues from NTR, transfer from
;;;government units and donor funding worth UGX.30.7Bn that
;;;affected budget implementation
;;;
;;; The district failed to absorb funds worth UGX.9.3Bn and these
;;;funds were subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund
;;;account.
;;;
;;; The district mischarged funds worth UGX.373, 406,160 on
;;;various codes other those budgeted for. Further, I noted that
;;;funds to the tune of UGX.93, 269,685 were spent on other
;;;activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;;
;;; I noted outstanding recoveries of funds from YLP and UWEP
;;;groups worth UGX.1, 793,009,954 by the year end.
;;;
;;; I noted that Arua District received a total of UGX.490,472,016. I
;;;reviewed the bank statements sampled schools and noted that
;;;the funds were still on the school accounts by 30th September,
;;;2021 and had hence not been utilized.
I reviewed funds absorption for salary and pension payments and noted under absorption of UGX.1.2 billion which may have led to non payment of eligible employees and pensioners I noted that UGX.3,339,798 was paid to 4 staff who had retired. These were payments for services not rendered to the District, resulting in loss of funds to Government. I noted that the District made unauthorized loan deductions amounting to UGX.39,469,082 relating to 40 employees that neither existed in the “active deduction” nor the “my approval” reports on the PDMS as evidence of approval.     I noted that 3 pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll Unqualified 14.
