      The entity had a court appropriation of UGX.1.162Bn for the financial year 2020/2021 and an appropriation by court brought forward from the previous year 2019/2020 of UGX.0.640Bn totaling up to UGX.1.802Bn receipts. Out of the total funds available for expenditure of UGX.1.802Bn, UGX.1.277Bn was spent by the bureau resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.525, representing an absorption level of 70.9%. I reviewed all the outputs and noted that the outputs were all adequately quantified. Out of the six (6) outputs assessed, one (1) was fully implemented, while five (5) were partially implemented. Five (5) outputs with twenty-four (24) activities worth UGX1.061Bn were partially implemented. URSB did not prepare performance reports for liquidation. I observed that the bureau had receivables carried forward from the previous financial years amounting to UGX.6.243Bn that remained outstanding at the end of the financial year under audit. 12 The Uganda Registration Services Bureau – Liquidation. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;

;;; Out of the seven (7) outputs sampled, five (5) were fully quantified, while
;;;one (1) was insufficiently quantified and one (1) was not quantified at all.
;;; Out of the five (5) outputs assessed, two (2) were fully implemented
;;;while three (3) were partially implemented.
;;; Submission of all the quarterly performance reports was made after the
;;;deadline date. Also, inconsistencies were noted in the annual
;;;performance report and the system-generated reports. For example,
;;;management reported four (4) and two (2) patents to have been granted
;;;in the financial years of June 2020 and June 2021, respectively. Yet the
;;;system report analysis showed that no patent had been granted in the
;;;last two financial years.
;;; Despite a positive increase in the number of searches on the system,
;;;there was a significant decline in the performance of industrial designs
;;;registered, Local Trademarks renewed, Patents granted, and foreign
;;;trademarks registered
;;; I analysed the number of applications received and eventually registered
;;;for the Utility model, patents and industrial designs and noted a
;;;significant difference in the number of applications that materialised to
;;;actual registrations. For instance, three (3) out of nineteen (19) Utility
;;;model applications were granted, two (2) out of the fifteen (15) Patent
;;;applications were granted, seventeen (17) out of the seventy-six (76)
