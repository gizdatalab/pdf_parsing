Section 63 of the Insurance Act requires the Insurance Training levy to be reconciled with Insurers within 60 days after the end of the calendar year. I however noted that a total of UGX.4.9Bn was collected based on basis of computed returns submitted by the Insurers and Health Member Organisations (HMO’s), with no evidence of reconciliation of Training Levy returns, contrary to requirements under the Act. As a result, the returns may be understated to reduce remittances, which may lead to revenue loss. 11 Insurance Training College (ITC). 2020/21  Unqualified Opinion;;;

   Arising out of a supreme court decision, all tax disputes in Uganda must first commence in the Tax appeal Tribunal before they move to any other court. A review of the cases filed at the Tribunal, in the last three years, revealed that there was an increase of cases filed from 40 in 2017 to 176 in 2020. In spite of the increase in cases, there has been no increase in the number of members of the Tribunal which has necessitated that the members of the Tribunal sit every day not withstanding their regular involvement in the administrative aspects of the Tribunal. The current structure of the remuneration of the members indicates that each member will be paid a sitting allowance and a retainer. This has resulted into the Tribunal spending the bulk of its money on the payment of allowances to the Tribunal members. During the reviews, I noted that there were instances in which a Tribunal member is an active partner of a Firm that has a case before the Tribunal. Whereas the said Tribunal Member does not form part of the panel of the committee adjudicating the disputes, this presents a potential conflict of interest for the members of the committee who work with him and have to decide the matters involving his Firm for which he is an active partner. I noted that the approved organisation structure for the Tribunal, did not have a provision for internal audit function and indeed, this role has not been assigned to any staff. This is contravention with the PFMA 2015, and it also denies the Tribunal an early warning mechanism in cases of errors of omission or commission. 13 Tax Appeals Tribunal. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
