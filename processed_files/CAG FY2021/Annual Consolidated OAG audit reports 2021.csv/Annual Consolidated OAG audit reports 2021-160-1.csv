"        The UPS prepared a strategic plan for the period 2020-2025 and was approved by the National Planning Authority on the 23rd of July 2021. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.310.8Bn, only UGX.306.5Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.4.4Bn representing an absorption level of 98.6%. I sampled fourteen (14) outputs with a total of eighty seven (87) activities and expenditure of UGX.316.2Bn for assessment and noted that ten (10) outputs with a total of fifty-seven (57) activities and expenditure worth UGX.293.82Bn were fully quantified and four (4) outputs with a total of thirty (30) activities and expenditure worth UGX 22.36Bn were insufficiently quantified I noted that of the 57 quantified activities worth UGX293.82Bn assessed; 35 activities representing 61% were fully implemented, 20 activities representing 35% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 4% were not implemented. I noted that a sum of UGX. 40,6Bn was released to UPS for the settlement of Domestic Arrears to suppliers under Covid-19 related funding with all funds spent for settlement of arrears. A trend analysis of the Service’s domestic arrears over the past three years showed a decreasing trend from UGX.65.97Bn in 2018/2019 to UGX.62.345Bn in 2020/2021. I noted that UPS was only allocated UGX.40.6Bn (67.4%) for settlement of domestic arrears worth UGX.60.2Bn and paid for arrears worth UGX.54.8Bn with the additional funds worth UGX.14.2Bn diverted from planned activities to pay for the arrears An assessment of service delivery revealed cases of overcrowding in prison cells with the congestion levels increasing from 291.5% in 2017/18 to 321.1% in 2020/2021. This compromises the welfare of the inmates and may result in a number of health risks such as the quick spread of diseases and compromising on sanitation. The existing congestion has proved a challenge for the prisons’ service when implementing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It has also posed a challenge in separating different categories of offenders to break the cyclic chain of crime and violence.  I noted that a total of 33 (12.7%) prisons stations are still using the bucket system of sanitation which may turn cells into a breeding centre for diseases, resulting in the violation of the prisoners’ rights  I noted cases of over stay of prisoners on remand with the prisoners’ 10 The Uganda Prisons Service. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
