   I noted that UWEC is one of the entities affected by the Government rationalisation policy on mergers anticipated to be concluded in 2023. By the time of reporting, discussions on transitional arrangements were ongoing. However, I was not provided with the transitional plans for a smooth merger. Delayed decision making leads to costly mergers and uncertainity amonst the stakeholders. Five (5) procurements with a total value of UGX.3.239Bn were not implemented as planned due to insufficient release of funds from GOU and the adverse effects of the covid-19 pandemic resulting into delayed service delivery. Although some electronic equipment and motor vehicles at cost of UGX.331Mn had been fully depreciated as per the previous financial year, they were still in use. Under the circumstances, the benefits accruing from them are not matched with their usage/expenditure. Management explained that the revaluation of assets had started, but COVID – 19 effects hindered the process. 9 Uganda Wildlife Education Conservation Centre. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;

Unqualified Opinion;; The entity budgeted to receive UGX.27.408Bn out of which UGX.22.934Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.4.474Bn which is 16.3% of the budget. This affected implementation of planned activities. I further noted that the Ministry did not seek a revision of its budget and work plan, as provided for by Section 17 (3) of the PFMA 2015, following the revenue shortfall.
