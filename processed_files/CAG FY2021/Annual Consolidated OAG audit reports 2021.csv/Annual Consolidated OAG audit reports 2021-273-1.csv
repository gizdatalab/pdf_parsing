The University had outstanding domestic arrears of UGX.5,681,315,557 dating as far back as financial year 2015/16. There is a risk that the University could face litigation from the suppliers and other beneficiaries. Gulu University is involved in several court cases and some of the cases remained pending at the financial year end. The cases are mostly between the University and its former staff, students and suppliers. The cases arose mainly from unlawful termination, breach of contracts, unfair treatment, land issues, Arrears/failure to pay suppliers.

Gulu University signed a contract for the construction of the Business and Development Centre on the 19th June, 2019 for a contract price of UGX.30,122,043,772. The construction start date was 1st August, 2019 and the expected completion date of 30th July, 2023. I noted that only UGX.2.1Bn out of UGX.6.0Bn was paid as advance for mobilization and this led to the temporary stoppage of works by the contractor which led to slow progress of the building works. At the time of concluding the audit, no major works were undergoing. I noted that the following University pieces of land were not titled; forest land measuring 28 hectares, Pajengo Latoro; Agago and Agora Pader land. There is a risk that the land in question could be lost to unscrupulous individuals.
