;;;makes dispute resolution difficult in case it arises. In addition, I noted
;;;that 50 of the 95 incubatees reviewed had expired MoUs at the time of
;;;reporting, while others were not paying NTR to the Institute as per
;;;agreement.
;;; It was observed that UIRI paid a total of UGX.1.286Bn in gratuity, for
;;;which PAYE was wrongly computed, resulting into an overpayment of
;;;UGX.100,778,201 to staff. The staff over payments can lead to financial
;;;loss to government, in the event the Institute is unable to recover from
;;;the concerned staff.

;Unqualified Opinion;;
;;;
;;;
;;;representing 91% of the total budget, and noted that 1 output (11%)
;;;with 04 activities and expenditure worth UGX. 1.05Bn were fully
;;;quantified. In addition, Four (4) outputs with twenty-five 25) activities
;;;worth UGX.9.47 Bn were partially implemented. Out of the twenty-five
;;;(25) activities, the entity fully implemented sixteen (16) activities, two (2)
;;;activities were partially implemented, while seven (7) activities remained
;;;unimplemented.
;;; I noted long outstanding receivables of UGX.211,105,359 from interdicted
;;;staff, and management has not yet instituted recovery measures due to
;;;the ongoing court cases.
;;; I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.63,568,761 were irregularly re-
;;;allocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on
;;;other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; I noted that 244 accumulated cases from 2017/18 are still pending as at
;;;30th June 2021. Over the last three years 48% of the registered cases
;;;have remained un-concluded during the year of registration. In addition,
;;;the legal department that handles petitions is at a 50% staffing level.
;;; I noted that the Commission has 81 approved staff positions, but only 50
;;;(62%) positions were filled leaving 31 (31%) posts vacant.
;;; I noted that the land and building on plot 7c, Luthuli close, Bugolobi
;;;where the EOC offices are located was transferred to the Commission by
;;;the Ministry of Gender, labour and Social Development. However, there
;;;was no trace of the original title, and there was no documentary evidence
;;;of handover of the title to EOC management.
;;; I noted that the report on gender and equity compliance of the budget
;;;framework papers was produced in December 2020, eleven (11) months
;;;later than the Parliamentary submission of the required certification and
;;;responsive measures of February 2020, contrary to the PFMA.
;;; I noted that the Commission lacked an independent Audit Committee,
;;;however, the functions of the Committee were being undertaken by the
;;;Commissioners who are part of the Commission management, thus
;;;posing serious challenges of conflict of interest.
