;;;(1,912 days) no section of the road was handed over and UNRA.
;;; There were significant defects on the road works. I observed failure of
;;;road shoulders, lined drain and a speed hump at KM88+678. It was also
;;;observed that the contractor continued to construct line drains on steep
;;;slopes without scour checks.
;;; I also observed poor quality works on some sections of the road
;;;construction. For example: poor visibility on the right-hand side of river
;;;Nguse bridge and also inadequate protection between the end of stone
;;;"pitching and the stream at the bridge; noticeable bleeding at Km 52+511,"
;;;failed line drain at Km71+200 RHS and damaged guard rail at km72+921
;;;"RHS; maintenance of the completed sections was poor with overgrown"
;;;"grass and silted drainages especially from Km 51 to Km 100, and;"
;;;pedestrian walkways were not provided for in the design of Kagadi town
;;;roads which were under construction at time of the audit.
;;; I noted lack of adherence to the insurance contract. The ICEA Workman’s
;;;Compensation Policy No 110-A2506044-18 covering the period 18th
;;;January 2021 to 17th February 2022 indicated that the number of staff
;;;insured are 181 only with neither the names nor the number of staff
;;;under each category/designation indicated but the monthly progress
;;;reports, the PAYE and NSSF returns for the period under review indicated
;;;that the contractor has over 400 staff. Further, the contract required that
;;;"the insurances are in the joint names of the parties that is; UNRA and the"
;;;contractor. However, the UAP Old Mutual contractor’s All Risk Policy No
;;;0000461578 and the ICEA Motor Commercial Policy No. 080-A2-105193-
;;;17 indicate that the insured was only the contractor.
;;; Work Permits for all the foreign consultant’s and contractor’s staff were
;;;not provided for review. In the absence of the work permits for the
;;;foreign staff, the implication is that the expatriate staff are working
;;;irregularly in Uganda irregularly and this may lead to deportation, which
;;;will in turn affect the progress of work.
    I observed significant delays in Project implementation. During the FY 2019/20, Project disbursements from ADF amounted to UA 6,679,508.53. From the signed loan amount of UA 70,000,000, only UA 24,672,103.72 representing 35% of the signed loan amount had been cumulatively disbursed through direct payments for Project expenditures as at 30th June 2020. However, 91% of the original project implementation time had elapsed as at 30th June 2020. Civil works for the upgrade of Bumbobi-Lwakhakha 44.5km road had attained 84% physical progress as at 30th June 2020 versus time progress and planned physical progress of 91%. The financial progress stood at 83% against plan of 92% as at 30th June 2020. For the upgrade of Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu (78.5km), 19.24% cumulative physical progress had been achieved as at 30th June 2020 although 33.4% was planned to be completed. During the FY 2019/20, UGX 3,033,479,790 (28%) of GOU counterpart project funds were re-allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project funds to other projects invalidates the approved plan for implementation of RSSP-V activities. UGX 267,083,716 was paid as interest on delayed payments. Such costs are un-necessary and represent unbudgeted expenditures which affect funds ear-marked for implementation of planned Project activities. UGX 226,500,820 had been paid to Government agencies (votes) including sub-counties and town councils during the FY 2019/20. These payments constitute revenue received for purpose of Government and 13 Road Sector Support Project 5 (Upgrading of Rukungiri- Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu and Bumbobi-Lwakhakha Roads (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2020.
