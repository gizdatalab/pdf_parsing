"         (4) outputs with a total of seventeen (17) activities and expenditure worth UGX 7.196Bn were fully quantified; four (4) outputs with a total of thirty one (31) activities and expenditure worth UGX 4.306Bn were insufficiently quantified. I assessed the extent of delivery of the 4 outputs that were fully quantified and noted that one (1) output with a total of two (2) activities worth UGX 0.439Bn was fully implemented. Two (2) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX 6.606Bn were partially implemented. Out of the fourteen (14) activities, the entity fully implemented four (4) (29%) activities; seven (7) activities (50%) were partially implemented while three (3) (21%) activities remained unimplemented. One (1) output with only one (1) activity worth 0.15Bn was not implemented at all. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX. 24.13m were irregularly re- allocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 after the prescribed deadline. In addition, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which are important in ensuring that the budget performs as expected. From my review of the annual cumulative performance reports and physical inspections/verification of performance, I did not observe any inconsistencies with the results of my verification. I noted that insufficient budget provisions (UGX.73,885,634) were made towards settlement of domestic arrears yet the arrears brought forward from the previous year were UGX.1,429,802,685. The Institute had NTR debtors to the tune of UGX. 282.97m at the end of the financial year under review. These were receivables from various insurance companies, MDAs and institutions for services rendered by the Institute. The Land Commission received a presidential directive to allocate Uganda Heart Institute 10 acres of land in Nakawa Naguru to facilitate the setting up of a Cardiac Centre of Excellence with a 250 bed hospital. However, I noted that during the year there were encumbrances on part of the allocated land which resulted in the loss of 3 acres after consensual withdrawal of a law suit.  Whereas the total contract sum of UGX. 3.5bn had been paid out for the renovation of the Intensive Care Unit on Block 1C, the works remained incomplete at the time of writing this report. A review of the staff structure of Uganda Heart Institute revealed that out of the approved structure of 189, only 160 positions were filled leaving 29 staff positions vacant.";;;
