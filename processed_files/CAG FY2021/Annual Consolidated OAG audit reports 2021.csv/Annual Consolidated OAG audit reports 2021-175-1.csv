;;;affected with water levels on Lake Victoria dropping back to normal
;;;hence making it difficult for the marine boats to fully utilise the docking
;;;area due to shallow waters. I noted that only half of the docking area
;;;was utilised contrary to the original plan.
;;; I inspected Magamaga cantonment and observed the following issues:
;;;lack of sufficient storage space, land encroachments’, inadequate water
;;;supply, poor road network, insufficient lighting system at the store
;;;premises, accommodation challenges, need to expand Health centre II to
;;;Health centre III and inadequate toilets at the store premises.
;;; I observed inadequate Fuel supply for Air Force training as Air Force is
;;;not allocated fuel for operations. but the same fuel allocation for training
;;;is used for other operations and yet the trainers have specific
;;;performance contracts.

;;;were constructed in past regimes, these have never been utilised
;;;subjecting management to buying Jet fuel from dealers at the open
;;;market pump prices and exorbitant prices.
;;; I inspected Special Forces Command (SFC) and observed creation of 206
;;;brigade SFC without sufficient funding. I noted lack of office furniture,
;;;storage space and CCTV cameras.
