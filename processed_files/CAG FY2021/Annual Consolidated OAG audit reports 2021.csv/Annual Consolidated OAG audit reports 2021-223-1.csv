During the FY 2020/21, Project disbursements from ADF amounted to UA 10,235,407.97 resulting cumulative disbursements of UA 34,907,511.69 (representing 49.9% of the signed amount of UA 70,000,000). Whereas the upgrading of Bumbobi-Lwakhakha (Lot2) 44.5km road had been substantially completed and the road was handed over to UNRA by the Contractor on 21st December 2020, the upgrading of Rukungiri-Kihihi- Ishasha/Kanungu (Lot1) 78.5km stretch had attained cumulative physical progress of only 42.6% completion rate against planned progress of 55.1% as at 30th June 2021.

   The Authority was made to pay interest as a result of delay to pay the contractor’s approved interim payment certificates (IPCs). The contractor invoked clause 14.7 and 14.8 of GCC and charged interest of UGX 373,044,074.47 for IPCs 1-6. Another interest amount of UGX 166,845,192 was paid for IPCs 11,12,13,14. The total interest paid for the delayed settlement of the IPCs amounted to UGX 539,889,266. These interest payments could have been higher if the dollar amounts had not been negotiated downwards by USD 108,262.29 due to disagreements in computations. During the FY 2019/20, UGX 892,920,000 of Project funds were re- allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project funds to other projects overrides established budgeting procedures. There were delays in recruitment of the Project consultant. In the period 15th March 2018 to 26th April 2021, there was no Project consultant procured to carry out supervisory roles for upgrading the Tirinyi-Kumi- 15 Upgrading of Tirinyi-Pallisa- Kumi and Pallisa-Kamonkoli Road project (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2020;;;
