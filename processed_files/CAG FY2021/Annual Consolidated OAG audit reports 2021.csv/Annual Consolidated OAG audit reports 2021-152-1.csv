;;;faced challenges as only 500,000 doses were delivered out of the
;;;procured 700,000 doses from the prior year and these came 4 months
;;;after expected delivery. Further, none of the procured 2,311,000 doses
;;;procured in May 2020 were delivered within the contract period despite
;;;the emergency situation and by the time of audit, the contract had not
;;;fully performed with 611,000 doses outstanding.
;;; Shortcomings were noted in the management of the Ministry Public
;;;Investment Plan (PIP) Projects in regard to compliance with the
;;;Development Committee Guidelines 2016 and the budget execution
;;;circular 2020/2021. I noted incomplete approvals for Projects, non-
;;;adherence of Projects with appraisal Guidelines, ongoing projects after
;;;expiry of project duration and irregular and excessive spending on
;;;recurrent Items
;;; Domestic arrears decreased by 14% from UGX.12.96Bn in the prior year
;;;to UGX.11.13Bn in the year under review. Further, a paltry UGX.2.42Bn
;;;budget provision was provided for settlement of domestic arrears in the
;;;current year budget.
;;; All documents pertaining to Contingency fund activities and transfers to
;;;agricultural institutions during the year worth UGX 11.95Bn were
;;;submitted to the IGG for investigations and I was unable to confirm
;;;whether the amount involved was applied to the intended purpose.
;;; Management did not undertake monthly wage and pension performance
;;;analysis to reconcile the payroll generated through the IPPS with the
;;;payment information from the IFMS as required resulting into delays in
;;;granting clearance to recruit, inefficient wage and pension payroll
;;;management, accumulated arrears and non-absorption of pension and
;;;gratuity budget.
;;; Out of 919 approved staffing positions, only 595 had been filled and the
;;;rest of the positions (324) were vacant representing 35% staffing gap.
;;;Among the vacant were key positions such as directors, commissioners,
;;;assistant commissioners and principals in core directorates and noticed

"     The entity had prepared the coffee strategy; but there was no approval and certification of the strategic plan by NPA to evidence alignment to the NDP-III at the time of audit. Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.27.5Bn, the Authority collected only UGX.20.1Bn, representing a performance of 73% of the target. There was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.5.8Bn representing 3.1% of the budgeted UGX.186.3Bn. Further, the entity remained with unspent balance of UGX.9.391Bn representing an absorption level of 94.8%. The Authority received off-budget financing worth UGX.443M which was never declared to the PSST and as such no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PSST. I sampled eight (08) outputs with a total of sixty two (62) activities and expenditure of UGX.150.6Bn and noted that one (01) output with a total of four (04) activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.1Bn was fully quantified; three (03) outputs with a total of fifty four (54) activities and expenditure worth UGX.67.1Bn were insufficiently quantified i.e. out of the fifty four (54) activities, forty nine (49) activities (91%) were quantified while the balance of five (05) activities (9%) were not clearly 15 Uganda Development (UCDA). 2020/21 Coffee Authority Unqualified Opinion";;;
