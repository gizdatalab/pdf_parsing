;;; The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on behalf
;;;of Lotteries and Gaming Regulatory Board awarded a UGX.10.833Bn
;;;contract to a foreign company to provide consultancy services for
;;;development of a National Central Electronic Monitoring system. The
;;;contract period was for 2 (two) years effective 23rd June, 2020. I noted
;;;that, two years later, the procurement has not been made. There is no
;;;provision for implementation of the system even in the current budget
;;;2021/22. The failure to procure the system, denies the Board the
;;;associated benefits like monitoring and revenue tracking. Beside this may
;;;result into litigation on grounds of breach of contract and expose
;;;Government to loss of funds in compensation.
;;; During the year under review, although the Board licensed 17 casinos,
;;;there was no evidence that the Board advertised the applications for the
;;;said casinos to invite the views of the public as is required by regulations.
;;;Failure to publish the notices poses a risk of granting licenses to
;;;operators with some conflicts among the public and as such may result
;;;into litigation.
"       I noted at the time of the audit that out of the planned Four (4) strategic targets/goals, No targets had been fully achieved, while three (3) were partially achieved, and one (1) target had not been achieved at al I noted that out of the budgeted revenue of UGX.28.4Bn for the year 2020/21, UGX.21.3Bn was realised representing a performance of only 75% of the target. Out of the 5 outputs assessed, No output was fully implemented; 5 outputs representing 100% were partially implemented, while no output was not implemented at all. I noted that although for Domestic arrears was UGX.42,407,000, funds amounting to UGX.432,579,009 were spent on domestic arrears for the FY 2020/21, implying an over expenditure of UGX.390,172,009 on this item. the budget Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.18.698Bn, UGX.18.59Bn was spent by the Authority, resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.0.108Bn representing an absorption level of 99%. The audit reviewed the performance of the above project and noted that much as most of the key planned activities had been implemented, there were few that were still pending. I observed that the entity has a staff establishment of 140 positions, out of which only 116 were filled, leaving 24 positions vacant, representing 17% of the workforce of the entity. In addition, seven staff exited the Authority during the year, due to various reasons. 25 Public Procurment And Disposal of Public (PPDA) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
