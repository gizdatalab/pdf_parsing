The Governing Council stated that a material uncertainty existed regarding the continued operation of Allied Health Professionals Council in the foreseeable future. Management’s judgement was informed by a letter from the PS - Ministry of Public Service to all Accounting Officers in which guidance was provided on the modalities for management of Public Institutions during the implementation of recommendations on the rationalization of Agencies and Public Expenditure. I noted that out of the ten (10) sampled outputs with a total of ten (10) activities and expenditure of UGX. 3.127bn, only five (5) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX 3.017Bn were fully quantified. The balance of five (5) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX.011Bn were insufficiently quantified which made it difficult to assess extent of their delivery. I observed that out of the five (5) outputs that were fully quantified, three (3) outputs with three (3) activities worth UGX. 1.918Bn were fully implemented. However, the remaining two (2) outputs with two (2) activities worth UGX.1.099Bn were partially implemented. The Council fleet of six (6) sampled vehicles was not annually inspected during the three (3) year period under review to assess their mechanical condition and road worthiness.  Whereas the Council designated a Transport Officer responsible for transport matters, fuel registers were not maintained for all the six (6) motor vehicles sampled out of nine (9) vehicles held by the Council. I noted that nine (9) out of the ten (10) Regional Offices were not allocated vehicles to facilitate their operations.       8 Allied Health Professionals Council. 2019/20 Unqualified Opinion;;;
