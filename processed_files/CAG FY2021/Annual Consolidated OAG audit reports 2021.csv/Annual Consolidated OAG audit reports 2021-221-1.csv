10;Kapchorwa-Suam Road Project (Uganda National Roads Authority) 2021 Unqualified Opinion;; I observed delayed access and possession of site by the contractor. The last section of the road (from km 48+000 to km 073+000) was granted to the contractor on the 14th of June 2021 which is after 888 days. Further, additional land acquisition is still under progress from Km33+000 to Km73+000. Civil works from Km 46 to Km 58 have been put on hold pending additional land take especially for slope protection. It was also noted that new structures were being erected in the road reserve at
;;;Km17+692 and KM5+430.

;;;2018 to upgrade Kapchorwa-Suam road for a period of 36 months, with
;;;effect from 1st October 2018. There was an extension of time of 4.5
;;;months up to 15th February 2022. Based on the extension of time, the
;;;time lapse as at 30th June 2021 was 33 months that is 81.40 %.

;;;43.14% with no active works from Km 55 to km 73.
"   I observed delayed completion of civil works on Upgrading of Bulima – Kabwoya Road (Lot2).The project commencement date was 1st December 2015, and the initial completion date was after 30 months on 31st May 2018. Successive revisions of completion dates extended the construction period by a further 22 months with the last revised completion date being 27th March 2021. A certificate of substantial completion was issued in January 2021, and the contractor allowed 12 months as the Defects Liability Period, expiring on 27th January 2022. The snag list included two main items; the construction of Hoima Town Roads and a way bridge. I observed delayed completion of civil works on Upgrading of Kigumba – Bulima Road (Lot1). The construction period was for 30 months (after commencement in March 2018), elapsing on 31st August 2020. When the Audit Team visited the site in September 2021, (42 months after commencement), the attained level of completion was approximately 95%. However, the new proposed completion date of 31st August had passed and no new completion date had been communicated. There were delays in payment of lot1 supervision fees. By the time of my audit, the Lot 1 Supervising Engineer’s unpaid invoices had accumulated to Euros 661,605 for the foreign component of the contract and UGX 1.38bn for the local component. The delays are likely to impact on the Engineer’s ability to perform the contractual obligations and in turn impact on the progress of the construction works. 11 Road Sector Support Project 4 – Kigumba-Masindi- Hoima-Kabwoya Road (2021) (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2021 Unqualified Opinion";;;
