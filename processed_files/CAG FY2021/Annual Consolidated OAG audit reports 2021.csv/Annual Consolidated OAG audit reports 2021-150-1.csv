"           The entity had prepared the strategic plan; but there was no approval and certification of the same by NPA to evidence alignment to the NDP- III at the time of audit. Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.3.587Bn, the Authority collected only UGX.0.12Bn, representing a performance of 3.3% of the target. There was 100% performance in GoU releases amounting to UGX. 243.9Bn. Further, NAADS remained with unspent balance of UGX.0.06Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. I sampled four (04) outputs with a total of twenty five (25) activities and expenditure of 184.4Bn and noted that two (02) outputs with a total of three (03) activities and expenditure worth UGX.43.19Bn were fully quantified while two (02) outputs with a total of twenty two (22) activities and expenditure worth UGX.141.19Bn were insufficiently quantified i.e. out of the twenty two (22) activities, fourteen (14) activities (64%) were quantified while the balance of eight (08) activities (36%) were not clearly quantified. Further, assessment of the implementation of the two (2) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of three (03) activities revealed that none was fully implemented. Assessment of one partially implemented output revealed that out of 3,010,000 hand hoes, only 2,500,000 hand hoes were procured and distributed to the Northern parts of the country instead of the planned vulnerable rural small holder farming households across the country. Submission of performance reports for all quarters was made after the deadline dates. Furthermore, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports. NAADS incurred huge LC charges to a tune of UGX.1.053Bn as a result of opened LCs worth UGX.71.25Bn for contracts that failed to deliver within the year. Further, I noted LCs worth UGX.23.13Bn that failed to perform for a period of more than two (2) financial years with one of UGX.2.071Bn for milk coolers outstanding for more than 4 years. Review of the Kasese industrial park Agri-LED intervention worth UGX.3.9Bn revealed allocation of land to a bus company contrary to the set objectives and delayed payment of NWSC to connect piped water. Review of the sugarcane production project implementation with investments of UGX.85Bn revealed shortcomings i.e.lack of feasibility assessment, lack of accruing benefits to the beneficiaries, weaknesses in the MoU signed with beneficiaries, limited information on members of the cooperatives, delays liquidated damages, and stalled activities. in contract completions, pending I noted failure to enter into MOU’s with beneficiaries of milk coolers contrary to the selection criteria of the standing orders of procedure for operation wealth creation. There was lack of clearly identified beneficiaries from the start in the transportation and distribution of hoes intervention, lack of MOU’s with delegated DLGs on distribution modalities and nugatory storage costs. Review of the tractor strategic intervention revealed lack of assessment of potential beneficiaries and non-adherence to the terms of the MoU thus risks of beneficiaries without the capacity to manage the tractor for 13 National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
