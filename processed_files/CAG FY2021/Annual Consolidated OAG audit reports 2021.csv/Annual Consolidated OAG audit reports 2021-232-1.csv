  Section 26(i) of the PFMA 2015 (as amended) provides that a Contingencies Fund shall every financial year be replenished with an amount equivalent to 0.5% of the appropriated annual budget of Government of the previous financial year. The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2019/20) was UGX.40.49Trillion, which would have translated into UGX.202.43Bn funding for the Contingencies’ Fund in the year under review. I noted however, that Parliament only appropriated UGX.62Bn to the Contingencies fund, causing a deficit of UGX.140.3Bn. Underfunding of the Contingencies Fund distorts implementation of the approved budget for the current year as evidenced by budget cuts and reallocations to fund supplementary budgets relating to natural disasters and emergencies that occurred during the year. Audit of the withdrawals made off the Contingencies Fund revealed that a total of UGX.62,070,000,000 was transferred to the Fund bank account held at Bank of Uganda. The funds were consequently transferred to entity bank accounts and expensed off the IFMS, which makes it difficult to follow up and track to confirm the adherence to the approved budget guidelines and also confirm accuracy of the reports generated. Spending off the IFMS also exposes the funds to the risk of misuse due to lack of transparency. 9 Contigencies’ Fund. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
