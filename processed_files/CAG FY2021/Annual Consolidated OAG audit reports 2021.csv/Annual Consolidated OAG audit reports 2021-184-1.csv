       was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.35Bn representing an absorption level of 91.5%. I sampled 5 outputs with a total of 16 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.89Bn and observed that 1 output with a total of 6 activities and expenditure worth UGX.1.14Bn was fully quantified, 2 outputs with a total of 8 activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.47Bn were insufficiently quantified while 2 outputs with 2 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.28Bn were not quantified at all. Out of 6 activities planned, only 2 were fully implemented (33%) while 1 activity was partially implemented (17%) and 3 activities were actually not implemented (50%). Funds to the tune of £ 890 (UGX.3,739,406) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The entity did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. A review of the cumulative performance reports revealed the subsequent quarterly performance reports did not include activities implemented in the previous quarter(s) and therefore, the cumulative activities reported in the fourth quarter performance report does not include all activities implemented in the first, second and third quarters. The Mission paid Euros.45,314 (equivalent to UGX.190,390,396) in respect of education allowances direct to its officials instead of their respective educational institutions or schools contrary to Section (E - e) Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Public Service Standing Orders 2010. The Mission had a fixed assets register detailing all of the Mission’s assets but lacked some of the information such as date of purchase, estimated useful life, maintenance costs and the expected date of disposal making it incomplete. I further observed that a number of the entity’s assets were old and due for boarding off but this had not been done.;;
