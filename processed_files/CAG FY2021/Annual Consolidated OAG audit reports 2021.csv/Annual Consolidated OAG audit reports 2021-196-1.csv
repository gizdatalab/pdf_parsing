         Out of the planned 10 (ten) strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, one (1) target had been fully achieved, three (3) were partially achieved, while six (6) were not achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.2.068Bn representing 1% performance. I sampled 3 outputs with a total of 13 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.57Bn and observed that 2 outputs with a total of 9 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.87Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with a total of 4 activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.6Bn was insufficiently quantified. Of the fully quantified outputs, 1 output with 5 activities worth UGX.0.21Bn was fully implemented while 1 output with 4 activities worth UGX.0.66Bn was partially implemented. Funds to the tune of MYR.11,209 (equivalent to UGX.9,763,039) were irregularly diverted from purchase of specialized machinery and equipment for which they were budgeted to purchase of curtains without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. The Mission submitted performance reports for Q2 and Q3 after the deadline given for submission of the reports. The Embassy paid MYR.136,000 (equivalent to UGX.118,456,000) in respect of education allowances direct to its officials instead of their respective education institutions or schools contrary to Section (E - e) Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010. The Mission has an approved staff structure of five (5) staff positions out of which, two (2) (40%) were filled leaving three (3) (60%) vacant. Management of the Embassy paid salary and FSA advances to staff to the tune of MYR.185,950 (equivalent to UGX.160,995,510) which exceeded three (3) months gross pay and no authority was sought from Secretary to the Treasury. This is contrary to the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010. Uganda High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. 2019/20 Unqualified 19 Opinion;;;
