"of advised the PSST to follow up the matter with the Accounting Officers the various MDAs to ensure that there is full quantification of activities and outputs. I f) Quantification of activities and Implementation of planned outputs 13 (15, b) of the PFMA 2015 states that a policy statement submitted by a vote shall contain the annual and three monthsâ€™ work plans, outputs, targets and performance indicators of the work plans. Regulation 11 (3) of PFMR 2016 requires that a vote prepares a work plan that indicates the outputs of the vote for the financial year; the indicators to be used to gauge the performance of the outputs and funds allocated to each activity. sampled 94 entities for purposes of assessing the extent of quantification and implementation of planned outputs I noted that out of the 1,681 outputs worth UGX.9.8tn sampled for review, 1,151 outputs (68.5%) worth UGX.6.8tn were fully quantified, 307 outputs (18.3%) worth UGX.2.1tn were partially quantified while 223 out puts (13.2%) worth UGX.902Bn were not quantified at all. of a total of 1,151 quantified out-puts worth UGX.6.8tn assessed, 465 (40.4%) output worth UGX.2.5tn were fully implemented, 592 outputs (51.4%) worth UGX.4.1tn were partially implemented, while 94 (8.2%) out-puts worth UGX.146bn were not implemented at all. The graph below shows the extent of implementation; to fully quantify the planned activities makes the assessment of implementation difficult.
