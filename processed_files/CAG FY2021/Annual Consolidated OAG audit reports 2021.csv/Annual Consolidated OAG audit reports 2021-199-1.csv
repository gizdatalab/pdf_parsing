I sampled 4 outputs with a total of 12 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.4.32Bn and observed that 2 outputs with a total of 8 activities and expenditure worth UGX.4Bn were fully quantified while 2 outputs with a total of 4 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.32Bn were not quantified. The quantified outputs were partially quantified. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, and Q3, after the deadline given for submission The Statement of Stores and Other Assets (physical assets) as at the end of the financial year 2019/2020 revealed that additions during the year relating to non-residential buildings were disclosed as UGX.149,778,932, however, the Embassy procured items amounting to UGX.333,509,897 implying that items worth UGX.183,730,965 were not disclosed in this statement thus understating the Statement of Stores and Other Assets (physical assets). The Embassy had an approved budget of UGX.196,000,000 for procurement of furniture and fixtures but a sum of UGX.333,509,897 on this item resulting into an excess expenditure of UGX.137,509,987. The Embassy procured furniture and fittings for furnishing six residencies and a Chancery worth RUB.6,795,232 (equivalent to UGX.333,509,897) but were not recorded in the Embassy asset register as well as the Board of Survey report, direct procurement method was used without justification, procurements did not undergo any evaluation of bids, contracts committee was not involved during the procurement process and contract managers were not appointed for all the procurements. The Assets Register maintained by the Embassy was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions as it lacked details of date of purchase, cost of purchase, maintenance cost, asset code and estimated useful life. The Embassy spent RUB.1,052,189.97 and EURO.370.37 (approximately UGX.53,187,249) on refunds for medical expenses to its officers contrary to the requirements of Section M (m-a) (14) of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.
