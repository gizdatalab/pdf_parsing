;;;contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20.
;;; The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 after
;;;the deadline given for submission. Furthermore, entities are supposed to
;;;report actual performance of the quarter as well as the cumulative
;;;activities of the previous quarter(s) but the Mission quarterly performance

;;; UGX.3.75BN was released for renovation and modification of Uganda
;;;Chancery Building in Paris but the procurement was undertaken using the
;;;restricted bidding instead of open domestic bidding without proper
;;;justification. Furthermore, the implementation of the contract had not
;;;commenced by the end of the financial and the contactor is said to have
;;;had difficulty in obtaining a bank guarantee from banks because the
;;;Mission is a foreign entity which could pose challenges in contract
;;;performance.

;;;which positions, 6 (86%) were filled leaving 1 (14%) vacant.

     Out of the planned 8 (eight) strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, two (2) were fully achieved while 4 (four) were partially achieved while two (2) were not achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.2.49Bn representing 5% performance. I sampled 4 outputs with a total of 8 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.62Bn and observed that three (3) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.54Bn were fully quantified while one (1) output with one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX.0.08Bn was not quantified. Of the quantified outputs, one (1) output with three (3) activities worth UGX.0.38Bn was fully implemented while two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX.3.16Bn were partially implemented. Funds to the tune of RAND.35,774.08 (equivalent to UGX.7,697,509) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, however they were submitted after the deadline. I also observed that cumulative performance reports did not include activities implemented in 29. Uganda Embassy in Pretoria. 2019/2020 Unqualified Opinion;;;
