;;;1,259,920,000 (30th June 2020). I further reviewed the ageing of the

;;;1,259,920,000 are payables worth UGX 357,139,495 that had remained
;;;outstanding for over 90 days.
;;; Seventeen (17) running motor vehicles which were fully depreciated
;;;according to the JCRC Fleet Management Policy and had zero net book
;;;value in the schedule of fixed assets were still in use. The entity did not
;;;revalue or make annual reviews of its expectations with regard to the

;;;Planning & Economic Development to increase Government funding to
;;;the Centre from UGX.240 million to UGX.5 billion annually in the
;;;subsequent years, that is, with effect from the Financial Year 2019/20.
;;;According to the various communications by the Centre’s Executive

;;; However, the no-objection for the implementation of the directive was
;;;only granted to the PS/ST by the PS MOH through letter ref: 45/415/01
;;;dated 4th February 2020. This was when the financial year 2019/20

;;;those worth UGX 1,521,900,000 (22%) were not conducted.
    The Governing Council stated that a material uncertainty existed regarding the continued operation of Allied Health Professionals Council in the foreseeable future. Management’s judgement was informed by a letter from the PS - Ministry of Public Service to all Accounting Officers in which guidance was provided on the modalities for management of Public Institutions during the implementation of recommendations on the rationalization of Agencies and Public Expenditure. I noted that out of the budgeted Non-Tax revenue UGX.2,891,430,000, only UGX.1,650,811,279 was realized during the year under review (representing 57% performance). This hampered effective service delivery. Contrary to the statutory deadline of 31st day of March for the publication all up-to-date registers in the gazette, registers for 2020 had not been published in the gazette by the time of audit in November 2020. 10 Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council. 2019/20 Unqualified Opinion;;;
