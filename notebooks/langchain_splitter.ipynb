I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.\\n\\nKey Audit Matter\\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.\\n\\n2.1.1.  \\nImplementation of the approved budget\\n\\nOn the 24 th April 2020, Parliament approved the annual budget for MDAs and LGs that contained the specific resource envelope allocated to each vote to implement agreed on\\n\\n4\\n\\n---\\n\\noutputs. Subsequently, the PS/ST issued a Budget Execution Circular that communicated the budget strategy, policy, and administrative issues to guide the budget implementation for the financial year 2020/2021.\\n\\nDuring my overall risk assessment exercise, I noted that MDAs and LGs are still experiencing challenges in implementing the budgets approved by parliament and policy guidance’s issued by PS/ST, which has continued to affect the performance and credibility of the budget negatively. These challenges include; lack of strategic plans that are aligned to the National Development Plans, underperformance of revenue, implementation of off-budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non- implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.\\n\\nI am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of several activities. Consequently, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic. It is against this background that the implementation of the budget was again considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning for the current audit year.\\n\\nConsequently, I developed procedures to address the performance of the budget of the entity (Detailed reports are provided in individual entity reports).\\n\\nFrom the procedures undertaken, I noted the following;\\n\\nSN Finding Recommendation a) Revenue performance  \\nI advised the Secretary to the A review of the approved budget estimates of the Government of Treasury to devise Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 revealed that the means of ensuring initial approved budget (resource envelope) for the financial year that all budgeted 2020/21 was UGX.45,493.69 Bn. The funding was later revised to revenue is always UGX.48,726.77 Bn, following approval for additional domestic collected to fund the financing of UGX.3,234 Bn. It was estimated that Tax and Non Tax budget as approved. revenue amounted to UGX.22,024.66 Bn, domestic borrowing would  \\nfinance UGX.6,794 Bn while external financing would provide grants  \\nof UGX.1,719.91Bn and loans of UGX.10,702.10Bn.\\n\\nThe table below summaries the performance of revenue by source; Funding source Approved Revised Actual (Bn) Variance Perform Budget (Bn) - budget\\n\\n- UGX (Bn) - ance UGX (Bn)-UGX UGX (%)\\n\\nDomestic Resources  \\nTaxes 20,218.68 20,218.68 18,252 1,966.68 90\\n\\nNon-Tax 1,805.98 1,805.98 1,648 157.98 91 revenue 1  \\nDomestic 3,560.32 6,794 6,794 - 100 financing  \\nDomestic 7,486.1 7,486.1 7,420 66.1 99 refinancing\\n\\n1 Includes Appropriation in Aid of UGX 215 billion.\\n\\n5\\n\\n---\\n\\n| SN Finding |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| Recommendation |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| A A \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 | External Resources |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Budget support |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Grants |<|<| 133.56 |<|<| 133.56 | 62.85 | 70.71 | 47 |<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Loans |<|<| 2,773.12 |<|<| 2,773.12 | 3,134.13 | -361.01 | 113 |<|  \\n|^| Project support |<|<||<|<|||||<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Grants |<|<| 1,586.35 |<|<| 1,586.35 | 1,026.04 | 560.31 | 65 |<|  \\n|^| Loans |<|<| 7,928.98 |<|<| 7,928.98 | 6,822.23 | 1,106.75 | 86 |<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Grand Total |<|<| 45,493.09 |<|<| 48,726.77 | 45,159.25 | 1,667.06 | 93 |<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Actual funding for the budget during the financial year was UGX. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| 45,159.25Bn (93%) against a revised revenue budget of UGX. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| 48,726.77Bn, indicating a shortfall of UGX. 3,567.52Bn.

An analysis of warrants approved revealed that a total of UGX.46,657 Bn was approved against the budgeted amounts, thus representing 90% performance. A sum of UGX.4,968 Bn was not availed for expenditure.

The detailed impact of this shortfall on the entity activities has been reported in the individual entity reports. Notably, there was a significant variance in project financing which is explained by under absorption by the various implementing MDAs. was observed that whereas the performance contracts with Accounting Officers are premised on availing the appropriated budgets during the year, such contracts are not revised in situations of shortfalls in budgets. Secretary to Treasury indicated that the funds releases to Votes are in line with the available resources issued in quarterly expenditure limits which are supported by actual revenue collections from URA and also indicated that Ministry of finance provides guidance by way of circulars to all Votes to fund only critical activities within the work plans in line with the available resources.

The details are indicated in the table below; Approved Warrants (UGX’ billion) Total Payments billion) (UGX’ Non - Wage 21,32 149 Develo pment 15,725 17.9 Unspent funds (UGX’ billion)  wag  e  73  - Non- Wage 2,327 - 45 - ENTI  Dev TY  CG  Missi  ons  LG  TOTA  L Wage 2,710 28 Non - Wage 23,647 149 Develop ment 15,771 18 wage 2,637 28 2,151 4,816 2,271 5,009 1,071 24,867 992.1 16,781 1,025 22,494 586 16,329 119 193 46 2,373 406 452 the above, it can be seen that 79% of the unspent funds related to non-wage expenditure while wage and development expenditure posted underperformance of 6% and 15% respectively. of the unspent funds under non-wage related to Vote 130 (Treasury Operations) and were meant to settle interest costs and treasury bills and Bonds redemptions. The occurrence has an implication of increasing financing costs incurred by the government since the interest costs and redemptions are done by Bank of Uganda which in turn charges the treasury for the advance. Most of the unspent funds under wage related to pension payments casting doubt on the existence of the said pensioners. absorption negatively affects service delivery since some of the planned projects and activities are not undertaken. Secretary to Treasury indicated that GoU operates a Cash budget which is based on actual inflows. The year under audit experienced cash shortfalls arising from, Domestic revenue shortfall as a result of the Covid -19 pandemic , late disbursements from IMF ,which came in on 30 June 2021 & Non disbursement from Afri-Exim Bank and African Development Fund. The occurrence contributed to delay in implementation of planned activities hence the under absorption of funds.

It was established that during the financial year ended 30 th June 2021, supplementary funding totalling UGX.6.13Tn was granted by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. It was, however, noted that the source of the funding for the supplementary expenditure was not clearly shown before approval was granted.  As a result, the supplementary expenditure was instead financed by internal budget cuts from various votes thus affecting implementation of plans/ activities by the affected votes. I noted that, although the budget was increased to UGX.51.625Tn, it was only funded to the tune of UGX.46.6Tn (90%funding). approval of supplementary budgets without a corresponding increase in revenue/financing could be attributed to fiscal indiscipline which leads to increased funding gap affecting the earlier budget objectives and plans. Secretary to Treasury responded that for the Financial Year 2022/23, the Ministry of Finance was using zero based budgeting approach to prioritize critical activities and expenditures to avoid supplementary requests during execution. The budget for 2022/23 is being used as a launchpad for restricting supplementary budgets to stabilize GoU budget execution going forward. Continued The |<|<|<|  \\n| e) | Budgeting for Non-Tax Revenue |<| I advised the PSST |  \\n|^|^|<| to ensure that all |  \\n|^| Section 6 of the Budget Execution Circular for the FY 2020/21 |<| Ministries, |  \\n|^| provides that all work plans and Budgets for FY2020/21 are prepared |<| Departments  and |  \\n|^| and approved using the Program Budgeting System (PBS). All |<| Agencies budget for |  \\n|^| Budgets, irrespective of the source of financing (GoU, NTR/AIA, |<| the Non-Tax Revenue |  \\n|^| Donor or LG Revenue), will be migrated and loaded into the |<| and have the details |  \\n|^| Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) to facilitate Budget |<| provided in the IFMS |  \\n|^| Implementation and reporting. |<| and the PBS. |  \\n|^||<||  \\n|^| According to the approved budget estimates for the FY2020/21, it |<|<|  \\n|^| was projected that a total of UGX.1.590 Tn would be collected as |<|<|  \\n|^| NTR. Review of the Performance Budgeting System(PBS) tool used |<|<|  \\n|^| by the Government and IFMS records revealed that that NTR Budgets |<|<|  \\n|^| for the respective MDAs were neither uploaded on PBS nor IFMS. The |<|<|  \\n|^| budgeting tool only had details regarding expenditure, and no |<|<|  \\n|^| revenue was included. I further noted that several Accounting |<|<|  \\n|^| Officers disowned the figures incorporated in the NTR Estimates |<|<|  \\n|^| book, indicating that they had not been consulted in arriving at the |<|<|  \\n|^| estimates incorporated therein. |<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n|^| As a result, I was unable to compare respective entity budget figures |<|<|  \\n|^| with the URA NTR collections that totalled to UGX.1.605Tn. The |<|<|  \\n|^| absence of revenue estimates for each entity undermines |<|<|  \\n|^| transparency, affects motivation of staff, and hampers performance |<|<|  \\n|^| assessment. |<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n|^| Management responded that for the budget of FY 2022/23, |<|<|  \\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n---\\n\\n| SN | Finding |<|<| Recommendation |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| respective MDAs had been requested to submit their NTR estimates |<|<|<|  \\n|^| which will be uploaded and reflected on the PBS as had been done |<|<|<|  \\n|^| in the NTR estimates booklets. PBS has been upgraded to include the |<|<|<|  \\n|^| NTR budgets for Votes. The approved estimates will also be uploaded |<|<|<|  \\n|^| on the IFMS for follow up on monthly performance reports. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n| of advised the PSST to follow up the matter with the Accounting Officers  the various MDAs to ensure that there is full quantification of activities  and outputs. I f)  Quantification of activities and Implementation of planned outputs 13 (15, b) of the PFMA 2015 states that a policy statement submitted by a vote shall contain the annual and three months’ work plans, outputs, targets and performance indicators of the work plans. Regulation 11 (3) of PFMR 2016 requires that a vote prepares a work plan that indicates the outputs of the vote for the financial year; the indicators to be used to gauge the performance of the outputs and funds allocated to each activity. sampled 94 entities for purposes of assessing the extent of quantification and implementation of planned outputs I noted that out of the 1,681 outputs worth UGX.9.8tn sampled for review, 1,151 outputs (68.5%) worth UGX.6.8tn were fully quantified, 307 outputs (18.3%) worth UGX.2.1tn were partially quantified while 223 out puts (13.2%) worth UGX.902Bn were not quantified at all. of a total of 1,151 quantified out-puts worth UGX.6.8tn assessed, 465 (40.4%) output worth UGX.2.5tn were fully implemented, 592 outputs (51.4%) worth UGX.4.1tn were partially implemented, while 94 (8.2%) out-puts worth UGX.146bn were not implemented at all. The graph below shows the extent of implementation; to fully quantify the planned activities makes the assessment of implementation difficult. Accounting Officers indicated that the outbreak of the Covid-19 Pandemic affected the implementation of the 2019/2020 budget, especially activities in the last half of the financial year. I Section Out Failure The |<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|  \\n| g) | Existence of Strategic plans that are aligned to NDP-III |<|<| I advised the PSST |  \\n|^|^|<|<| to follow up the |  \\n|^| Paragraph 5 of the budget execution circular for the financial year |<|<| matter with NPA and |  \\n|^| 2020/2021 cites poor alignment of Government Budgets with the |<|<| ensure that the |  \\n|^| National Development Plans. The PS/ST urged Accounting Officers to |<|<| entities  have |  \\n|^| ensure that all activities for Financial Year 2020/2021 are aligned |<|<| strategic plans that |  \\n|^| with NDP III and implemented accordingly. Regulation 26 (1) of the |<|<| are aligned to NDP- |  \\n|^| National Planning Authority (development of Plans) regulations |<|<| III and certified by |  \\n|^| require entities to submit to NPA their five-year development plans |<|<| NPA. |  \\n|^| for certification before approval. |<|<||  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| This being the first year of implementation of the NDP-III, MDAs |<|<|<|  \\n|^| were expected to prepare strategic plans aligned to NDP III and |<|<|<|  \\n|^| ensure that these plans are certified by NPA before approval. These |<|<|<|  \\n|^| plans would then be the basis for preparation of the entity annual |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n---\\n\\n| SN | Finding | Recommendation |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n|| plans. |<|  \\n|^||<|  \\n|^| From the procedures undertaken I noted that out of 94 entities |<|  \\n|^| sampled, 75 were supposed to prepare strategic plans that were |<|  \\n|^| aligned to NDPII. However, out of 75 only 25 (33%) had their |<|  \\n|^| strategic plans certified by NPA. The balance of 50 representing 67% |<|  \\n|^| were not certified by NPA. There is a risk that activities implemented |<|  \\n|^| by these entities during the financial year 2020/2021 were not |<|  \\n|^| aligned to the NDP-III which negatively affects the achievement of |<|  \\n|^| NDP-III objectives. |<|  \\n|^||<|  \\n| I advised the Accounting Officers to comply with the law and guidance given by the PSST and ensure that in future, all funds received outside the approved budget are appropriated by way of a supplementary. h) Off Budget Financing/Receipts Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015 states that all expenditure incurred by the government on externally financed projects in a financial year shall be appropriated by parliament. Paragraph 29 of the Budget Execution Circular for the Financial year states that if an external agency provides funds in the course of implementation of the budget or any funds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation, these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line with the Public Finance Management Act 2015. noted that 30 entities received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.627.124Bn, which was never declared to the PS/ST and was also not appropriated by Parliament. As such, no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PS/ST. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities, contrary to Section 43(1) of the PFMA 2015 and the budget execution guidelines. Accounting Officers explained that this was due to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such receipts and in some cases funds are received during the year which were not expected at the time of planning. I The |<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n2.1.2. COVID 19 expenditure\\n\\nThe emergence of the Global Covid-19 pandemic presented a social and economic threat to many countries in the world, including Uganda. In response, the Government of Uganda developed and instituted several interventions to control and avert the effects of the pandemic on the economic and social wellbeing of its citizens. The interventions included instituting a total lockdown, closure of airports, restriction of cross boarder movements, and increased surveillance among others which in turn necessitated additional funding. Mobilisation of revenue was also negatively affected due to low economic activity.\\n\\nIn addition to the local revenue raised by the Government to support the budget, Government proceeded to secure additional funding to facilitate the efforts and interventions\\n\\n11\\n\\n---\\n\\nbeing undertaken to manage and control COVID-19 and its effects on the economy and the society in general.\\n\\nIn a letter dated 09th August 2021, the PSST advised me that the total amount released for COVID expenditure in the FY 2020/21 was UGX.2,371Bn of which a total of UGX.677Bn was disbursed for the settlement of domestic arrears.\\n\\nDuring the audit, I designed and performed procedures that I considered appropriate under the circumstances to enable me to gather evidence to address the specific objectives listed below;\\n\\ni) Confirm whether the funds received by Treasury were dully appropriated by parliament.  \\nii)\\n\\nEstablish whether funds appropriated and allocated were received by the different votes  \\niii)\\n\\nEstablish whether the appropriated funds were utilised for the purpose for which they were approved.  \\niv)\\n\\nAssess the existence and effectiveness of internal control systems. v)\\n\\nAssess the extent of achievement of planned output by the different entities  \\nvi) Establish whether all funds disbursed were properly accounted for and value for money was attained.  \\nvii)\\n\\nMake appropriate recommendations to strengthen accountability and transparency.\\n\\nFrom the procedures undertaken the following summarised key findings were noted, the detailed report was issued separately as the COVID 19 thematic report;\\n\\nSummary of key findings\\n\\n- USD 345million received by GoU in respect of support to Bank of Uganda for Balance of Payment was confirmed received and banked intact in Citi bank New York to enhance the Country’s foreign reserves.\\n\\n- A total of UGX 676Bn was allocated and disbursed to various MDAs to settle domestic arrears with a view of improving liquidity within the local business community. I noted that 90% of funds used appropriately for the intended puropose; however, I noted diversion of funds to pay for unrelated expenditure worth UGX 4.897Bn (0.7%), unsupported domestic arrears of UGX 27.38Bn(4%), and Payment for contested/rejected domestic arrears of UGX.1.245Bn(0.2%). I also noted that UGX 33.8Bn (5%) was used to settle international obligations thus did not contribute to the stated objective since the funds were externalised.\\n\\n- UGX 260Bn allocated for the Emyooga programme was disbursed to Microfinance Support Centre with a goal of transforming household incomes by increasing employment opportunities and access to financial services to the rural areas. Audit confirmed that UGX 219.40Bn (84%) had so far been disbursed to 6,326 EMYOOGA SACCOs. It was, however, noted that the SACCOs were in the process of obtaining operational licenses; no MoUs had been entered into between the disbursing entity and the beneficiary SACCOs; UGX.34,716,666,049 (1.3%), though disbursed, remained un- accessed by the beneficiary SACCO.\\n\\n12\\n\\n---\\n\\n- A total of UGX.56.8Bn was disbursed to MSc to increase the funds available for on- lending to different businesses. I noted that MSc lacked capacity at zonal offices to appraise loans which was also manifested in the unbalanced approach for loan appraisals. A total of UGX 13b (23%) was disbursed to applicants without MSC finalising the perfection of securities for the collaterals. UGX.2.5Bn (4%) was irregularly advanced to applicants contrary to the credit policy. A total of UGX 3.149Bn (6%) was advanced to applicants with no collateral.\\n\\n- A total of UGX.31.033Bn was disbursed to the Ministry of Science Technology and innovation to support 23 selected projects of scientists and innovators engaged in CoVID-I9 scientific research, including the procurement of specialized machinery and equipment, development of vaccines, drug diagnostics, and other operational costs. The funds were divided into UGX.15.787Bn for purchase of Equipment and UGX.15.245Bn for Operational Costs. An MOU was entered with Presidential Scientific Initiative on Epidemics (PRESIDE) to provide technical and administrative oversight at an operational level. It was noted that most projects were progressing well. It was also noted that due to the general weaknesses identified, there was a need to provide more guidance to the beneficiaries on how to account for Government funds.\\n\\n- Out of UGX 558.68Bn appropriated, 531.8Bn was disbursed to Uganda Development Bank for recapitalization, leaving UGX 26.87Bn unremitted by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. From the amount disbursed, funds worth UGX 234bn had been paid out to various beneficiaries; by the time of the audit, the balance of UGX 292.66Bn was still deposited in commercial banks.\\n- Of the amounts paid out, UGX95bn was sent to financial institutions and SACCOs following MoUs entered into by UDB and the financial Institutions, for the latter to on lend to stated beneficiaries.\\n\\n- Euros 1,602,370 (equivalent to UGX.7,136,910,000) received by UDBL from the European Union for the Tourism Sector. As at 10 th June 2021, 25 applications worth UGX 9.55 Bn had been approved, and grant disbursements worth UGX 4.34 Bn. had been processed to 14 projects.\\n\\n- Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development disbursed UGX.126.9Bn to Uganda Development Corporation, to finance projects aimed at supporting the private sector to avert the effects of Covid-19. I noted that the capitalisation grants to UDC are assigned to specific projects thereby nullifying the internal appraisal processes of UDC. 54% of the funds remained unutilised as the projects were not ready for investment.\\n\\n- UGX 253.59bn was released and received by the Ministry of Health. MoH used the money to procure medical supplies, 282 motor vehicles, pay allowances to medical workers, masks, intensive care equipment and build modular houses at 6 border points. All the planned activities were undertaken amidst many challenges. I noted a diversion of funds totalling UGX 7.98Bn. Though funds were paid for the acquisition of vaccines, there were delays in the delivery of the vaccines due to the global demand. There was a delay in the installation of intensive care equipment in Gulu, Mbarara, Bombo, and Lacor hospitals due to building inadequacies.\\n\\n- Whereas medical workers requested to be given UGX.150,000 per day as risk allowance, this was not possible and they were instead paid UGX.80,000 per day. They made a\\n\\n13\\n\\n---\\n\\nrequest to parliament to have this amount exempted from taxes, but the issue was never resolved. In the meantime, UGX.2.2Bn meant for PAYE was not deducted from the allowances paid to medical workers in the period under review.\\n\\nKey Recommendations\\n\\n- Management should ensure that compensating controls are put in place in times where conventional controls cannot be implemented.\\n- Sensitisation of private individuals and organisations to whom public resources are entrusted should be done prior to disbursement of the funds.\\n- The PS/ST should clearly communicate the intentions of given initiatives before funds are disbursed to implementing agencies to avoid a mismatch between the intended objectives and actual outputs.\\n- Government entities and projects should be assessed for capacity to implement given tasks before funds are disbursed to them.\\n\\n2.1.3.  \\nCompensations/Acquisition of Right of Way for Selected Transmission Lines Projects\\n\\nThe Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals Development, is responsible for provision of policy guidance in the development and exploitation of the energy resources, creation of an enabling environment to attract investment, and provision and utilization of energy resources.\\n\\nCurrently, UETCL’s network consists of 2,989.2Km of high voltage lines distributed as; 1,008km of 220kv, 1,946km of 132kv and 35km of 66kv , with 25 substations with a total transformation capacity of 2829.5 MVA. However, this is still low, given that Uganda still has one of the lowest per capita electricity consumption in the world with 215 KWh per capita per year, given that the Sub-Saharan Africa’s average is 552Kwh 2 .\\n\\nGovernment has spent significant amounts in compensation of Projected Affected Persons. In a period of 5 years, financial years between 2016/17 to 2019/20, a total of UGX.564.57Bn has been spent in compensations of PAPs.\\n\\nThe delays in undertaking the construction of the transmission lines has been largely attributed to inadequacies in the compensation of Project Affected Persons. The challenges faced in “Acquisition of the Right of Way (ROW)” have led to delayed implementation of a number of projects in the Energy Sector.\\n\\nOwing to concerns over the progress of the implementation of the transmission infrastructure under UETCL, the Office of the Auditor General undertook an audit on the compensation of PAPs under selected transmission line projects. The overall objective of the audit was to ascertain whether the compensation process of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) was implemented in accordance with the Compensation Guidelines and other Government Legal Frameworks to enable efficient and effective service delivery.\\n\\nThe scope of the audit included the Grid Extension and Reinforcement Project (GERP) and the Mputa Transmission lines. The following are the summary of the key findings and recommendations made, and the details are in the thematic report on compensations;\\n\\n2 Uganda energy situation-energypedia.  \\n14\\n\\n---\\n\\nSummary of Key Findings:\\n\\n- 56% of the PAPs for GERP and Mputa projects were not properly identified, and this resulted in a mismatch between the number of PAPs appearing on the payment files and the survey reports and Valuation Reports prepared by the Chief Government Valuer.\\n\\n- The valuation process was marred with a number of irregularities, which included; the use of un-updated district compensation rates; and unverified legal interests in the land; resulting in unnecessary revaluations and ligation which in turn delayed the RAP processes, thus affecting timely project completion.\\n\\n- The budgeting, disbursement, and absorption of compensation funds were not properly managed. There are seemingly budget slacks. Although the Survey and Valuation Reports are supposed to guide the budgeting for compensations, management prepared budget estimates which were not supported, this resulted in over budgeting to the tune of UGX.111.3Bn.\\n\\n- I noted that of the released compensation amount of UGX.21.5Bn for both GERP and Mputa Projects, only UGX.5.86Bn (27%) was paid to PAPs, thus resulting in unspent funds to the tune of UGX.15.64Bn (73%). This mostly affected the GERP Project which had UGX.13.17Bn not utilized, while Mputa had UGX.1.66Bn.\\n\\n- I also noted significant delays in compensation of PAPs. 1,109 PAPs (52.2%) for Mputa and 821 (35%) for the GERP Transmission Line remained unpaid by the time of concluding the audit (November, 2021). This was mainly caused by outstanding grievances whereby 52% and 15% of the grievances remained unresolved for GERP and Mputa Projects, respectively. Relatedly, Compensations in kind also delayed whereby out of 149 PAPs identified, only 93 were resettled, leaving 56 PAPs not resettled.\\n\\n- I noted a number of inadequacies in the construction of the resettlement houses which included; irregular payments to contractors, delayed progress of works, discrepancies in drawing specifications and BOQs, poor materials used for construction, and a number of defects which were not rectified.\\n\\nKey Recommendations\\n\\n- Management should always ensure that the RAP consultants thoroughly validate the preliminary information obtained during social survey and valuation processes, to enable accurate justification of PAPs\\n- The District Land Boards should ensure compensation rates are regularly updated and communicated to the CGV, to enable appropriate valuation of the land and properties.\\n- Management should streamline its RAP processes, including proper identification of PAPs, clear valuation processes, and timely submission of PAP documentation, among others.\\n- Management should ensure proper supervision and monitoring of construction works.\\n\\n15\\n\\n---\\n\\nEmphasis of Matter\\n\\nWithout qualifying my opinion, I draw attention to the following matters in the consolidated financial statements that in my judgment are of such importance and fundamental to users’ understanding of the financial statements;\\n\\n- Government Loans (Borrowings) – UGX 69.6Tn\\n\\nAs disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the government Loans have increased from UGX.56.9Tn, in 2020 to UGX UGX 69.6Tn in 2021 constituting an increase of UGX 12,718Bn (22.4%) increase. This position reflects the country’s increased borrowing to combat the effects of the Covid19 pandemic.\\n\\n- Domestic arrears – UGX 4.65Tn\\n\\nAs disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the domestic arrears have increased from UGX.3.83Tn in 2020 to UGX 4.65Tn in 2021 constituting a 21% increase. The amount represents 9% of the revised budget of government of Uganda for the financial year 2020/21. This is an indication of the failed commitment control system. The growth trend appears unsustainable and on the rise. This could also be as a result of approving supplementary budgets with no matching funding.\\n\\nThe PS/ST explained that government is currently implementing a Domestic Arrears Strategy to clear significant amounts of the verified arrears.\\n\\n- Contingent Liabilities – UGX 160Tn\\n\\nAs disclosed in the statement of contingent liabilities, Government contingent liabilities have increased to UGX160Tn up from UGX.11.5Tn reported in the previous year, representing a 1,290% increase. Most of the contigent Liabilities are arising out of court awards and compensations. The trend continues to appear unsustainable in the event that a significant percentage crystallises into liabilities.\\n\\n- Classified Expenditure – UGX 840.8 Bn\\n\\nAs disclosed under note 8, a total of UGX 840.8 Bn relates to classified expenditure. In compliance with Section 24 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (Classified Expenditure), this expenditure is to be audited separately and a separate audit report issued.\\n\\n- Non-Consolidation of Subventions\\n\\nIt should be noted that this opinion excludes the details of expenditure worth UGX. 955Bn for subventions whose financial statements are not consolidated in the financial statements of the parent votes. Separate opinions were given on the individual financial Statements of the subventions.\\n\\n16\\n\\n---\\n\\nOther Matter\\n\\nI consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements;\\n\\n2.1.4. Tax policy  \\na) Absence of clear policies to guide the Tax Exemptions and other Investor Incentives\\n\\nAudit observed that there is no clear policy guideline for the issuance, management, and monitoring of the different tax benefits and incentives issued by the Government to different individuals. The absence of a clear mechanism and framework exposes the scheme to mismanagement and abuse.\\n\\nFor example, there were inconsistencies in the grant of tax benefits to the various beneficiaries, and some conflicted with earlier policy decisions that were made by Government. A review of the letter of undertaking/commitment signed by the Minister of Finance relating to an Industrial park establishment revealed that Government was taking over import duty and VAT on all materials and machinery imported by the beneficiary with the exception of steel items. However, a review of the Memorandum of understanding signed by the GoU and an Industrial park company investor revealed that there was no exception relating to steel.\\n\\nIt was also established that Government had offered a 10 year tax holiday to the steel sector with the aim of promoting the growth of the sector as well as boosting employment.\\n\\nIn light of the above, there is conflict in policy as presented in the above agreements and commitments. The Government may not achieve the objectives for having granted the 10 year tax holiday for the steel sector.\\n\\nIt was also noted that there is no mechanism in place for evaluating and or assessing the impact of the benefits granted. I noted 20 beneficiaries whose benefit period has since expired without follow up.\\n\\nIn the absence of a monitoring framework, Government is not in position to assess the impact of the tax benefits granted to the various beneficiaries. Government is bound to lose revenues that would have accrued if the beneficiaries were effecting payments and this may also cause unfair competition in the market.\\n\\nManagement indicated that the issue at hand would be solved by the ongoing development and implementation of the tax governance framework.\\n\\nThe PS/ST is advised to develop a comprehensive framework to guide the identification of beneficiaries/criteria, the nature of benefits to be granted, the duration of the grant and assessment mechanisms.\\n\\n17\\n\\n---\\n\\nb) Continued loss of revenue due to Failure by Government to meet contractual obligations\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda (GOU), through the Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, entered an agreement on 4 th April, 2003 with Oil Refinery company for the development of oil palm industry in Uganda. Under Article 5(7) of the Agreement, GOU was required to pay VAT on the products of the all companies envisaged under the project from the first year of the project activities and ending after a period of eleven (11) years from the year of handing over the 26,500 hectares of land. It was agreed that the company would then refund (subject to clause 3 of article 4) the VAT paid by the Government with interest over a period of eight (8) years in eight equal installments, including accrued interest starting in the twelfth (12 th ) year.\\n\\nHowever, Government has breached the contract by failing to provide the balance of the 10,000 hectares of land as agreed. There is no documentation to show that the Ministry has made any follow-up on this matter.\\n\\nDue to Government’s failure to provide the balance of the required land, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development has continued to settle all tax obligations on behalf of the Company. In the financial year 2019/20, the Minister wrote off a total of UGX.194Bn in line with the Tax Procedures Code Act (2019), being arrears as at 30 th June 2019 and also a total of UGX.79.8Bn was accumulated in the year under audit in arrears. Under the circumstances, it is apparent that instead of paying for 11 years, Government has so far paid for 17 years and is still continuing while the chances of recovery appear to be slim.\\n\\nThe continued failure to provide land continues to affect the Uganda Revenue Authority in its revenue collection efforts and also affects Government of Uganda revenue performance.\\n\\nManagement explained that Government has provided additional Land in Sango Bay bringing the total land provided to 22,500 hectares. The balance of 4,000 hectares is being sought in collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries. Once this is completed, the Company shall start refunding GoU taxes accumulated accordingly. The Ministry has further written to the Attorney General seeking advice on how the agreement can be amended.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the responsible agencies and ministries to expeditiously address the land issue. In the meantime, the PS/ST should also follow up with the Attorney General on the possibility of reviewing the terms of the agreement.\\n\\nc) Continued build up of Government tax arrears; UGX.212.747Bn\\n\\nArticle 17 of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended) provides that it is the duty of every Citizen to pay taxes. Article 152(1) provides that no tax shall be imposed except under the authority of an Act of Parliament. The same Article provides that where a law enacted under the provision of the Article empowers any person to waive or vary a tax imposed by that law, that person or authority shall report to parliament periodically on the exercise of those powers as is provided for by the law.\\n\\nThe tax procedures Code Act (as amended in 2019) provides that the Minister shall pay taxes due and payable by the Government arising from any commitment made by the\\n\\n18\\n\\n---\\n\\nGovernment to pay taxes on behalf of a person, or owing from the Government through the acquisition of goods and services. In addition, Section 40A (2) of the same Act provides that all unpaid taxes by Government as at 30 th June 2019 are written off. The Minister was tasked with gazetting the list of all taxes waived under the provision of Section 40A(2).\\n\\nIn compliance with the provision of the Tax procedure Code Act, the Minister issued a list of beneficiaries of the said tax waivers totalling UGX.809.734Bn. This was gazetted in the Uganda Gazette of 13 th March 2020. The write-off in question affected the tax heads and in amounts as summarised in table 4below;\\n\\nTable 4: Tax arrears\\n\\n| Nature of Tax | Total Amount written off (UGX) |  \\n|---|---|  \\n| Value Added tax (VAT) | 348,986,568,013 |  \\n| Stamp Duty 8,460,910,000 |<|  \\n| Pay As You Earn (PAYE) | 158,293,699,210 |  \\n| Import Duty 98,569,989,826 |<|  \\n| Excise Duty | 52,685,114,511 |  \\n| Income Tax 114,133,374,978 |<|  \\n| Withholding Tax | 28,604,598,593 |  \\n| Total  809,734,255,131 |<|  \\n\\n\\nIt has however been noted, that one year later, a total of UGX.212.747Bn has already been accumulated at the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in tax arrears as 30 th June 2021. The occurrence is a manifestation that a tax write off is not the solution for the issue at hand. The tax arrears build up continues to negatively affect the revenue collection efforts of Uganda Revenue Authority.\\n\\nManagement responded that the writing off of tax arrears by the minister was consistent with the law, specifically Article 152 (1) of the Constitution and Section 40 of the Tax procedures Code Act. This discretionary power is useful because it addresses strategic circumstances which merit government interventions that were not provided for in the tax acts. Exercise of this discretion by the minister is reported to parliament every end of the quarter.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to review the practice and come up with a lasting solution in respect of companies to which tax incentives and other benefits a granted.\\n\\n2.1.5.  \\nAudit of public debt\\n\\na) Public Debt Portfolio Analysis\\n\\nThe reported total public debt as at 30 th June, 2021 stood at UGX.69,600 Bn, of which Domestic Debt Stock was UGX.25,288 Bn and the External Debt Stock was valued at UGX.44,312 Bn. This is an increase of UGX.13,429 Bn, equivalent to 23.9% when compared to the debt stock of UGX.56,892 Bn reported as at 30 th June 2020. The table below shows the details;\\n\\n19\\n\\n---\\n\\nTable 5: Debt portfolio analysis\\n\\n| Financial year | Domestic debt (UGX Bn) | Foreign debt (UGX | Total (UGX Bn) | % |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| ended |<| Bn) |<| change |  \\n| June 21 | 25,288 | 44,312 | 69,600 | 23.90% |  \\n| June 20 17,975 38,196 56,171 23.50% |<|<|<|<|  \\n| June 19 | 15,221 | 30,905 | 46,126 | 11.10% |  \\n| June 18 13,059 28,386 41,445 23.60% |<|<|<|<|  \\n| June 17 | 11,407 | 22,102 | 33,509 ||  \\n\\n\\nSource: Audited financial statements of Vote 130\\n\\nFrom the above, I noted that there was a consistent increase in the total debt and from financial year 19/20 to 20/21, there was an increment of UGX. 13,429Bn (23.90%). The net increase in the debt is due to increased borrowing from both the domestic and external sources, with domestic debt accounting for a higher increase.\\n\\nPublic debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. The graph below illustrates the trend of public debt stock by type over the past five years;\\n\\nFigure 2: The trend of public debt 80,000  \\n70,000  \\n60,000\\n\\n50,000  \\nDomestic debt (UGX Bn) 40,000  \\nForeign debt (UGX Bn)\\n\\n30,000  \\nTotal (UGX Bn)\\n\\n20,000 10,000\\n\\n0  \\nJun-17 Jun-18 Jun-19 Jun-20 Jun-21\\n\\nAlthough government has developed a domestic revenue mobilisation strategy, this appears not to be in harmony with the spending, raising concerns of sustainability.\\n\\nManagement indicated that revenue Mobilization had recently been affected by reduced economic activity as a result of restrictions imposed to slowdown the spread of COVID 19. COVID 19 has also led to additional expenditure pressures, which necessitated increased borrowing. Going forward, Government will focus on reducing expenditure and increasing revenues in a bid to bridge the fiscal gap and reduce the rate of debt accumulation. These commitments have been clearly spelt out in the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility, which is\\n\\n20\\n\\n---\\n\\nawaiting Parliamentary approval. Further to the above, Government is finalising the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) that will improve alignment of government programmes and projects to suitable financing options. The Strategy will in turn enhance the efforts in resources allocation, utilisation and address issues on debt sustainability.\\n\\nI await implementation of the Charter for Fiscal Responsibility. b) Assessment of debt sustainability\\n\\n- Debt to GDP Ratio\\n\\nDebt to GDP ratios is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a country to pay both internal and external debts and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates when lending due to the low credit rating of the country that pushes its lending risk high.\\n\\nThough the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, the developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold.\\n\\nA review of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a 6% increase from 41% last year to 47% in the year under review. The graph below illustrates the movement;\\n\\nFigure 3: Debt to GDP ratio 160  \\n140  \\n120\\n\\n100  \\nTotal Debt(UGX Bn)\\n\\n80\\n\\n60  \\n40 29.0 31.0 34.0 35.0\\n\\n20\\n\\n-\\n\\nGDP\\n\\n47.0\\n\\nDebt to GDP Ratio 41.0\\n\\nJun 2016 Jun 2017 Jun 2018 Jun 2019 Jun 2020 Jun 2021\\n\\nFrom the above, it can be seen that though Uganda’s GDP has been increasing over the years since 2013/14, its debt position has also increased. The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk of reaching unsustainable levels in the future.\\n\\nManagement attributed the increased debt levels to Government’s ambitious infrastructure program under National Development Plans I and II that were particularly focused on the energy (dams and power lines) and transport sectors. In addition, the need to expedite\\n\\n21\\n\\n---\\n\\ncommercial production of our oil resources has also necessitated the development of infrastructure which will aid the production process.  \\nIt was also indicated that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a contraction in economic activity and shortfalls in domestic revenue collections while at the same time creating additional spending areas to mitigate the pandemic impact. To maintain debt at sustainable levels, Government had embarked on a fiscal consolidation strategy aimed at accelerating implementation of the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation Strategy and expenditure rationalisation.\\n\\nI advised the PSST to consider exploring ways of reducing dependence on debt and expediting the implementation of strategies to enhance revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures.\\n\\n- Interest to Total revenue ratio\\n\\nThis benchmark shows the proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestically-raised component of the budget only. Government set the ceiling to be 12.5% in its debt strategy. The table 6 below shows the assessment of the benchmark over the years;\\n\\nTable 6: Total revenue ratio\\n\\n| Financial year | Total domestic | Total Interest - UGX | % of Interest to | Benchmark |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| Revenue - UGX |<| revenue |<|  \\n| 2020/21 | 20,199,013,110,066 | 3,118,535,556,062 | 15.4 | < 12.5 |  \\n| 2019/20 17,453,981,414,553 2,475,531,497,733 14.2 < 12.5 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 2018/19 | 17,128,743,726,614 | 2,005,380,900,988 | 11.71 | < 12.5 |  \\n| 2017/18 15,219,588,786,381 1,937,371,886,367 12.73 < 12.5 |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nIt has been established that the interest to revenue benchmark has been breached as evidenced above. Almost 15% of the revenue being collected is going into servicing interest payments. This is gradually reducing the funds available for funding other critical government expenditures, given that 25% goes to salaries and wages.\\n\\nManagement indicated that efforts were being made to reduce the interest to revenue ratio by taking steps to reduce the level of domestic borrowing a view to attaining the operational ceiling of 1% of GDP and also working to increase domestic revenues through the operationalization of the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy (DRMS). The implementation of the DRMS had stalled in the last two years due to the pandemic-induced shocks. The DRMS aims to increase to tax to GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage points every year largely through the improvement of revenue administration.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to implement strategies of reducing the growth of interest expenditures at the same time increasing revenue mobilisation.\\n\\n- Low Tax to GDP ratio\\n\\nSection 2.1 (i) Public Debt and other Financial Liabilities Management Framework for the FY2018/19 to FY2022/23 provides that the Government of Uganda shall work towards 22\\n\\n---\\n\\nraising its tax-to-GDP ratio to the Sub-Sahara Africa’s (SSA) average of 15.1% as part of Uganda’s Financing Strategy to limit on borrowing.\\n\\nAudit reviewed the Country’s tax collections and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and noted that from the start of the implementation of the framework in the FY2018/19, Uganda had made an improvement and currently stands at 13%; however, more strides have to be made to make it to 15% and more. Refer to the table 7 below;\\n\\nTable 7: Tax to GDP ratio\\n\\n| Financial year | GDP at Current Prices | TAX collections | Tax/GDP |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| (UGX) Billions | (UGX) Billions |<|  \\n| 2020/21 | 147,962 | 18,594 | 13% |  \\n| 2019/20 139,689 16,042 11% |<|<|<|  \\n| 2018/19 | 132,090 | 16,146 | 12% |  \\n\\n\\nThe continued failure to collect sufficient revenue will imply more borrowing and creates a risk that the Country may not achieve the World Bank Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\\n\\nManagement indicated that the Ministry’s tax expenditure analysis revealed that government was losing up to 1 to 2 percentage points of GDP per year, besides the fact that Government of Uganda informal economy is close to 50% of GDP. In addition, a VAT gap analysis carried out discovered a 40% compliance gap. The Ministry is implementing tax administration measures as part of the measures within the Domestic revenue mobilization strategy to improve tax to GDP ratio that include Automation of URA revenue collection systems through EFRIS, Digital Tax Stamps, Enhancement of ICT infrastructure, Installation of scanners at all customers border entry points, Improved Tax payer education, Implementation of a project to improve record-keeping by SMEs for improving compliance.\\n\\nManagement through URA also committed to ensuring increased tax compliance.\\n\\nI advised the PSST to formulate policies that will further enhance domestic revenue mobilization. In the meantime, government should consider limiting its expenditure to within the limits of sustainable financing.\\n\\nc)  \\nContinued securing of High cost Temporary advance from Bank of Uganda\\n\\nSection 36 (3) of the PFMA 2015, stipulates that the Minister of Finance may raise a loan by issuing Government bills, bonds or stock or using any other method the Minister may deem expedient, including a fluctuating overdraft.\\n\\nMinistry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development requested for a temporary advance of UGX.2.1 Trillion from Bank of Uganda in line with the Public finance Management Act, 2015. The advance was granted on 1 st October 2020, the Bank of Uganda granted the request based on an average interest rate of the 272 day Treasury bill rate of 9.999%. Government paid an amount of UGX.98,770,218,774 as interest for the temporary advance due to delayed pay back.\\n\\n23\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer indicated that the Ministry had embarked on negotiation with the central bank to adjust the interest rate to a fairer benchmark, though this still has to be in line with the Bank of Uganda Act which stipulates use of a market rate.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the negotiations.\\n\\nd)  \\nAbsence of Policy to manage Interest rate risk\\n\\nA Policy Framework serves as the guiding policy document for institutional development. The Policy Framework translates goals and objectives into attainable targets with outreaching impacts. Audit noted that the Treasury did not have a policy to manage interest rate risk. Without a Policy, there are no streamlined and institutionalized interventions that foster proper safe guards of public resources.\\n\\nIt was noted that the country continues to engage in the acquisition of debt with floating interest rates from Bilateral countries and Commercial Banks that use the ‘Libor’ and ‘Eurobor’ interest rates and thus the need for safeguards to be imposed.\\n\\nIt was further noted that the Government debt management policy on external debt does not give sufficient guidance on the use of instruments such as ‘SWAPs’ in risk management. As a result, most products are market-driven which is exposing Government further to new risks.\\n\\nI noted that Government entered into a SWAP arrangement with two commercial banks towards the repayment a loan. A review of interest movements on the LIBOR revealed that Government has since made a financial loss of UGX.65,627,696,205 and has not yet benefited from the SWAP agreements with the two banks.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer responded that the conclusion of the 15-year Interest Rate Swap transaction in June 2016 was a risk mitigating action against possible increases in US$ LIBOR which was made on the basis of historical US$ LIBOR rates. It could not take into account the ramifications of the CoVID-19 pandemic and the associated interventionist changes in US Monetary policy; as they were not evident in 2016. Current Indications are that restoration of market based interest rates will occur in the near future and hence pointing to the necessity to keep the SWAP in place as insurance against likely future interest rate increases. Government is currently undertaking a midterm review of the Public Debt Management Framework (PDMF) 2018. The proposed measure will therefore be considered and appropriate policy actions will be instituted for the remaining period of the framework and the longer term.\\n\\nI advised management is to develop a policy on management of interest rate risk to minimise the exposure.\\n\\ne) Failed on-lending scheme\\n\\nG overnment of Uganda has over the years, secured funds for on-lending to various ministries, departments and agencies to undertake various projects. Whereas MDAs signed the on-lent loan agreements, there was an inability by some of the MDA’s to actually re-pay the on-lent loans. It was oserved that only Four(4) out of the Thirteen(13) MDA’s were found to be compliant with the repayment of the loans.\\n\\n24\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt was further noted that;\\n\\n- There were no criteria in place to assess which MDAs to lend to.\\n- There was no record of assessment/ feasibility studies undertaken to establish whether the choice of on-lent financing was the best modality to finance the infrastructure projects.\\n- I noted that Government used non-concessional loans for on-lending, which attracted higher interest rates and shorter grace periods for the loan repayments as compared to the concessional loans which made it very costly. Some MDAs have had challenges with absorption and thus repayment.\\n\\nWithout a clear policy in place, the above shortcomings will continue to occur. This is causing a strain on government as funds are diverted to pay the loan obligations.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer noted the observation and indicated that some of the beneficiary agencies that were not servicing the loans were taking various steps to have the issues resolved including seeking cancellations, write off loans by Government, and conversion of loan into equity among others.\\n\\nG overnment should develop a clear on-lending policy if it continues to use the above option as a channel for funding projects.\\n\\n2.1.6.  \\nManagement of ICT in government\\n\\na) Failure to rationalize IT investments\\n\\nAudit observed that there is massive duplication of IT systems and projects by the different MDAs attributable to implementation of IT initiatives in silos by the different MDAs. This has the effect of resulting into wastage of resources.\\n\\nThe isolated implementation of ICT initiatives also has the effect of compromising the standard of ICT infrastructure used by Government, which has the effect of compromising service delivery and wasteful expenditure on ICT systems that are not to be used.\\n\\nAudit noted that several MDAs have procured several systems with the same functionality, established data centers, server rooms and disaster recovery sites to which the government has spent billions of shillings and the same continue claiming an annual maintenance fee. The major challenges, however, are that due to rapid technological changes, the investments require frequent upgrade infrastructure.\\n\\nAudit noted that whereas the ICT strategy gives guidelines on the budgeting and acquisition of ICT systems including the involvement of the Ministry of ICT and NITA in ensuring standardization of systems and prevention of duplication of government systems, the continued individual actions by some MDAs has resulted in uncoordinated budgets and procurements of systems.\\n\\nIt is important to standardize, streamline and harmonize the budgeting, acquisition, deployment and disposal of IT services in Government to eliminate duplication; enhance information sharing and interoperability of e-government applications.\\n\\n25\\n\\n---\\n\\nManagement explained that rationalization of IT investments has been an ongoing activity spearheaded by NITAU. This activity resulted in a report which is still under discussion. Despite the desire by NITAU to rationalize IT investments, it is true that some Government Ministries, Departments and other Agencies have continued to procure own systems and Infrastructure. However, with the ongoing discussion, it is expected that rationalization of government’s investments in IT systems will be achieved.\\n\\nI advised Government to expedite the ongoing rationalization and also streamline the budgeting and procurement of different ICT systems through seeking concurrence of the Ministry responsible for ICT and NITAU before funds for system acquisition are included in the budgets of MDAs.\\n\\nb) Weaknesses in management of recoveries arising out of anti-corruption cases\\n\\nSection 10(4) of the Anti-corruption Act, provides that in addition to any other penalty imposed upon conviction on a person order that person to make good the loss occasioned to the property; and the value of the property or damage to the property shall constitute a civil debt from the person to the Government or public body concerned and shall be recoverable from that person.\\n\\nA review of decisions from the Anti-corruption Division of the High Court revealed that on several instances, the court has made orders as to refund of proceeds of corrupt practices by persons convicted. The following were observed;\\n\\n- A sample of the cases reviewed revealed that a total of UGX.24,734,116,888 is outstanding as a result of decisions of the courts for refund of proceeds of corrupt practices but these are not provided for in the consolidated accounts as receivable.\\n\\n- In my 2019/20 report for the DPP, I also observed that a total of UGX.18,940,206,109 remained uncollected in spite of the setup of a department within the Office of the DPP responsible for enforcing the recovery of compensation orders.\\n\\n- The gaps in the collection were partly attributed to the lack of a clear mandate to the DPP, especially in so far as recoveries of compensation would require civil processes which are outside the mandate of the criminal mandate of the Office of the DPP.\\n\\n- Whereas the mandate of recovery would be a reserve of the Attorney General who is vested with the mandate to litigate civil matters, it was noted that the ODDP has in place a unit for recovery of funds arising out of prosecutions in DPP while IGG also has another.\\n\\nFailure to enforce the recovery of court orders, denies government the funds that should have been generated and undermine the objective of recovering losses incurred by the government due to corrupt practices.\\n\\nIt is therefore important that the Government comes up with a regulatory framework that addresses the inadequate legislation on recovery of proceeds of crime, provide for: civil asset recovery, detailed procedures in conviction based recovery, asset management and\\n\\n26\\n\\n---\\n\\ndisposal, recovery of consequential benefits, and how to apply the recovered proceeds, among others.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer responded that the Ministry had initiated consultations with the Office of DPP, IGG and Attorney General for establishment of comprehensive procedures for recovery of proceeds of crime, provide for civil asset recovery, provide for detailed guidelines in conviction based recovery, provide for asset management and disposal, recovery of consequential benefits including application of the recovered proceeds.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the consultations.\\n\\n2.1.7.  \\nAudit of public investments\\n\\na) Failure to Appraise Projects before funding - UGX.643,434Bn\\n\\nSection 3.18 of the Development Committee Guidelines provides that assessment of the project viability shall be measured by the following key indicators including: The Financial Cost Benefit Ratio (CBR), the financial Net Present Value (NPV) and the financial Internal Rate of Return (IRR).\\n\\nThe guide further requires that all new Projects requiring funding should undergo four levels of approvals before they can be admitted into the Public Investment Plan (PIP). The four levels include; preparing a project concept in line with NDP (II), preparing a Project Profile demonstrating Key results, undertaking a prefeasibility study and undertaking feasibility study.\\n\\nReview of the Public Investment Plan for the year ended 30 th /06/2021, revealed that out of a sample of 371 projects, 245 projects (66%) with total Project values of UGX.643,434 Bn did not have feasibility studies undertaken.\\n\\nFailure to conduct feasibility studies may lead to the projects failing to achieve the desired project output, duplication or conflicting Government interventions thus causing wasteful expenditure.\\n\\nManagement committed that going forward all projects will be appraised before inclusion in the PIP. In addition, the DC guidelines were being revised to take into consideration other exceptions, such as social projects, IT solutions among others.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the commitment.  \\nb) Non-compliance with the 70% Capital Threshold\\n\\nSection 2.2: Scope and Institutional arrangements of the Development Committee guidelines requires that Public investments admissible into the PIP shall be limited to public spending to acquire or establish physical assets necessary to facilitate production and delivery of economic, social and administrative services. Interventions that can be undertaken in the recurrent budget shall not be accommodated in the PIP. In this regard, for a project to be admitted into the PIP, its capital component shall account for at least 70% of the total project cost. It further states that interventions that can be undertaken in the recurrent budget shall not be accommodated in the PIP.\\n\\n27\\n\\n---\\n\\nAudit reviewed the Public Investment Plan for the year ending 30 th June 2021 and noted that 125 projects in the PIP with total budgets of UGX.4,410Bn did not meet the requirement of 70% capital intervention. The aggregate project expenditure on administrative functions was 75% while the aggregate capital expenditure requirements were only 25% of the entire total budget. I noted that some projects had 100% administrative expenditure. Refer to the table 8 below;\\n\\nTable 8: Noncompliance with the 70% capital threshold\\n\\n| No. of projects | Total Budget - | Capital | Administrative | % of |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| UGX | Expenditure - UGX | expenditure - UGX | administrative |  \\n|^||<|<| expenditure |  \\n| 125 | 4,410,809,884 | 1,087,332,424 | 3,323,477,460 | 75% |  \\n\\n\\nIf this remains unchecked by the development committee, the government runs a risk of spending project funds on recurrent expenditure and thus failing to meet the targets set in the National Development Plan III.\\n\\nIn addition, it was noted that the Development Committee does not consider software and intellectual properties as assets. This implies that any innovations in the ICT sector will continue to be unfunded, despite their potential to generative substantial returns.\\n\\nManagement explained that Section 2.2 applies to new projects to be admitted into the PIP and the budget. This requirement is fully adhered to by the DC but as projects continue into execution, recurrent costs can go higher, depending on the requirements between OPEX and CAPEX. The current DC guidelines are currently under review to provide for among others social projects, Grants, software investments and intangible assets, among others.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to review the guidelines taking into account the project lifecycle and classification of assets to include intangible assets.\\n\\nc) Overstay of projects in the PIP - UGX.39,011Bn\\n\\nThe Public Investment Management Reform Strategy provides that projects are supposed to be delivered on budget and on time in order to achieve the desired goals and objectives.\\n\\nAudit observed that in the sample of 371 projects, 342 projects (92.2%) with budgets totalling to UGX.39,011Bn had gone past their planned exit periods, that date as far back as the FY2010/11, with some projects having been extended for more than 12 years. Audit noted that the projects continued to receive DC approval for continued stay on the PIP It was noted that only 40% of the projects in the Public Investment Plan (PIP) were still within their expected time period.\\n\\nThis was attributed to lack of adequate planning and readiness, delays in procurements, late acquisition of right of way, poor contract management and inadequate capacity to implement and evaluate ongoing projects, and unauthorized change in the scope, among others.\\n\\n28\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis has caused delays in the completion of key projects, cost overruns and high commitment fees on foreign debt on account of low absorption and failure to complete projects on time.\\n\\nManagement attributed the overstay to implementation challenges which often lead to extensions in the PIP. Management also informed me that the Ministry had now adopted the resolution not to admit any project into the PIP and budget before completion of all required feasibility studies and ensuring that challenges that often lead to project extensions such as delays in acquisition of right of way, Environmental and Social impact assessment, among others are fulfilled before project commencement. In addition, the Ministry’s leadership had directed that all old projects which continue to face implementation challenges either be cancelled and or renegotiated with the respective funders.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to devise a mechanism to improve the efficiency with which projects are implemented by ensuring that the causes identified above are addressed.\\n\\nd) Under absorption of funds by projects\\n\\nAccording to the approved Budget estimates of the FY2020/21, the Resource Envelope of Financial year 2020/21 approved by Parliament totals UGX.45,493.7Bn of which External Financing consists of Project Support of UGX.9,515.3Bn and General Budget Support UGX.2,906.7Bn.\\n\\nAudit obtained and reviewed cash inflows and expenditures of externally funded projects and noted poor absorption/performance of externally funded projects. Out of UGX.9,515.3Bn that was appropriated by Parliament, only UGX.4,516.5Bn (47%) was released. Relatedly, absorption of externally funded projects further declined in the year under audit. Out of the UGX.4,516.5Bn Disbursed for donor-funded projects, only UGX.2,937Bn was spent, representing 65.0% as compared to the 71% observed in the FY2019/20. The table 9 refers to;  \\nTable 9: Absorption of fund\\n\\n| External | Release | Expenditure | Release | Expenditure | %of funds | %of funds |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| financing | (UGX) Bn | (UGX)Bn | Variance | Variance | not | not |  \\n| Budget |<|<| (UGX) Bn | (UGX) Bn | released | Absorbed |  \\n| (UGX)Bn |<|<|<|<| (UGX) Bn | (UGX) Bn |  \\n| 9,515.30 | 4,516.50 | 2,937 | 4,998.80 | 1,579.50 | 53% | 35% |  \\n\\n\\nThe under absorption of externally funded projects in the FY2020/21 was mainly due to the following;\\n\\n- Implementation of unready projects, unrealistic conditions precedent to disbursements of funds which constrains decision making during project execution;\\n- Covid-19 restrictions that affected implementation of projects\\n- Delayed land acquisition;\\n- Failure to quantify counterpart funding requirements at the time of project appraisal and;\\n- Cumbersome procurement processes as well as failure to undertake a comprehensive appraisal of projects.\\n\\nContinued underutilization of external financing may lead to an increase in commitment charges and disadvantage other projects that could have utilized those resources efficiently. 29\\n\\n---\\n\\nManagement explained that a number of measures have been introduced to improve project absorption as follows;\\n\\ni)  \\nAll projects to have feasibility studies before commencement and entry into the PIP, ii)  \\nOnly sign loan agreements when conditions precedent have been fulfilled.  \\niii)  \\nAll readiness conditions including acquisition of right of way, availability of adequate financing etc. as stipulated in the Project Selection criteria should be met before admission into the PIP and budget,  \\niv)  \\nEnforce and enhance contract management through adhering to procurement regulations and training of contract managers.  \\nv)  \\nA project management module in the Integrated Bank of Projects has been developed that will flag delay in a milestone and remind project managers on the required steps to facilitate expenditure.\\n\\nvi)  \\nThe Ministry is encouraging that Project management and implementation is undertaken by certified Project Management Professionals (PMP) who have the right skills, professionals and belong to a body that updates management knowledge. In this way project managers will be charged for underperformance which leads to low absorption.  \\nvii)  \\nTraining of staff involved in loan and contract negotiations,  \\nviii)  \\nUndertake continuous training of staff in project appraisal, selection, execution, and ex-post evaluation,  \\nix)  \\nEstablish a Project Preparation Fund to support preparation of feasibility studies and provide resources for preliminary activities.  \\nx)  \\nEnforce the use of the Integrated Bank of Projects (IBP) for submission, preparation, execution and ex-post evaluation of projects,  \\nxi)  \\nAdjusting to alternative strategies and approaches for project execution in light of Covid -19 restrictions and protocols e.g. virtual platforms, shifts for workers, embracing mass vaccination among others,  \\nxii)  \\nFast track approval of the revised PPDA regulations, train staff on timely initiation of procurement processes and execution of contracts,  \\nxiii) Applying sanctions and rewards to efficient and inefficient Accounting Officers, respectively.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the above measures.\\n\\n2.1.8.  \\nContinued expenditure off the IFMS – UGX. 695,372,792,876\\n\\nThe government of Uganda introduced the IFMS with a core objective of ensuring accurate, reliable and complete financial information for Government Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities as well as an increase in the transparency of public spending.\\n\\nFrom a sample of ministries, it was observed that several entities which are already on the IFMS system, continue to send huge block figures outside the system after charging expenditure codes on the system; however, the ultimate expenditure cannot be restricted to what was charged. It was also noted that a number of entities post these funds to commercial bank accounts a practice that was stopped many years back.\\n\\n30\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt was also noted that a number of projects run by the various Ministries, departments and agencies are all spending off the IFMS. Although some of the bank accounts are held at Bank of Uganda, there are challenges of monitoring expenditure.\\n\\nManagement explained that whereas a significant amount of projects and subventions have been set up on IFMS either directly through being converted into Votes, the remaining subventions and Institutions are undergoing rationalization which will reduce the number of agencies off the IFMS. As explained, GoU is also undertaking a re-implementation of the IFMS which will have all projects aligned to departments under the parent Ministry.\\n\\nThe Ministry was to progressively set up the remaining agencies and stations as the exercise is ongoing coupled with resource availability to finance the IFMS rollout.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to ensure that all government expenditure is made on the IFMS and also provide a road map to ensure integration of all projects onto the IFMS.\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities, a statement from the Hon. Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, a statement from the Secretary to the Treasury, a statement from the Accountant General, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.\\n\\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda.\\n\\nThe Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\n31\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also;\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the government’s internal control.\\n\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to fail to deliver its mandate.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other\\n\\n32\\n\\n---\\n\\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\nOther Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19(1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of the GoU Consolidated Financial Statements that; except for the matters raised in the compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the GoU consolidated financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the consolidated financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\nReport on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of Government, with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.\\n\\nThe material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;\\n\\n2.1.9.  \\nUse of prior financial years unspent funds\\n\\nArticle 154(1)(b) of the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended), provides that no monies shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund except where the issue of those monies has been authorised by an Appropriation Act, a Supplementary Appropriation Act or as provided under clause (4) of this article. The Article further provides that no monies shall be withdrawn from any public fund of Uganda other than the Consolidated Fund, unless the issue of those monies has been authorised by law.\\n\\nSection 17(3) of the Public Finance Management Act requires Votes which return funds to consolidated fund to revise their annual work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to take into account the unexpended money and the Minister responsible for the vote shall submit, as part of the budget for the preceding year, the revised work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan.\\n\\nIn the FY 20/21, it was observed that a total of UGX.26,098,586,831 was repaid into the consolidated funds from unspent monies from different votes. The said funds were however consequently utilized by the GOU without any form of appropriation.\\n\\nThe spending of funds by the GOU without appropriation of the said funds is irregular.\\n\\n33\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the PSST to always seek supplementary approval from Parliament before using returned funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn F. S. Muwanga AUDITOR GENERAL\\n\\n31 st December, 2021\\n\\n34\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2 REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021\\n\\nTHE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\\n\\nOpinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Local Governments, which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying Consolidated statements for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments for the year ended 30 th June, 2021 are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with Section 52(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Local Governments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\nKey Audit Matters\\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\n\\n2.2.1.  \\nPayroll management in Local Governments\\n\\nOver the years, several reforms have been implemented in payroll management including salary, pension and gratuity payroll management decentralisation. Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the management of payroll in the Local Governments (LGs).  \\nAs a result, I considered payroll management in Local Governments as a Key Audit Matter and identified crosscutting risks including; unrealistic budgeting for employees and pension costs, under absorption of wage funds, delayed access\\n\\n---\\n\\nto the payroll, over payment of salaries, non-payment of salary and pension arrears, among others.\\n\\nThe wage and Pension Payrolls of UGX.2,586.47 Bn constituted 46.1% of the overall Local Governments budget for 2020/2021 of UGX.5,615.86 Bn.\\n\\nI am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of payroll management activities. A number of Local Governments did not carry out planned recruitments resulting into huge unspent balances.\\n\\nConsequently, I designed procedures to address the risks in the payroll management in Local Governments. (Detailed findings are provided in individual entity reports)\\n\\nBased on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;\\n\\n| No Observations |<|<|<|<|<|<| Recommendations |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| a) Payroll management in Local Governments |<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the |  \\n| Absorption of the released funds for payroll  I reviewed funds absorption in 100 LGs and noted an under absorption of UGX79.62Bn.

The extreme delays were noted in Mbarara MC, Kaberamaido DLG, Buyende DLG and Buhweju DLG of 8, 9, 8 and 11 months respectively.\\n\\nDelayed/ non remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA could lead to delays in up-dating loan status with the various financial institutions causing un-necessary default charges on employees while delayed remittance of PAYE attracts fines and penalties from the Revenue Authority.

For the under payments, the Accounting Officers attributed it mainly to suspension of staff salaries due to disciplinary issues, delayed removal of staff from the payroll and delays in resolving issues such as abscondment where payments were withheld. For delays in remittance of deductions, the Accounting Officers attributed it to delays in reconciliation of interface deduction files. ii) Un-authorized loans deductions  I noted that 48 LGs made unauthorised loans deductions totaling UGX 11.10 Bn. The deductions were from 6,835 employees that lacked letters of consent/ undertaking. I further noted that out of the 48 LGs, 23 LGs (48%) registered 1,916 employees with deductions totaling to UGX 3.77 Bn that did not exist in the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS), operated by PCA-Payroll Consults Africa. There is a risk of making deductions from staff that have no loans, which deprives them of their earnings. The inconsistencies in the PDMS undermine the relevance of the system and affect the integrity of the data therein. The Accounting Officers acknowledged the shortcoming and explained that letters of undertaking were being signed although file copies were not being retained for future reference. They further explained that the inconsistencies in the PDMS data were attributed to PCA who largely control and manage the system. |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| the urged I advised the Accounting Officers to sensitise  newly recruited employees on the timely submission of the key documents.

I further noted that 407 employees in 17 LGs had not yet accessed the payroll by the close of the financial year. Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears. The Accounting Officers attributed the shortcoming mainly to delayed submission of key personnel documents and data mismatch between IPPS & NIRA. |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|| ii) Delayed access to pension payroll  noted that 780 pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll, |<|<|<|<| I advised the |  \\n| I |^|<|<|<|<| Accounting Officers to liaise with MoPS to initiate strategies of rectifying  the inconsistencies  with |  \\n|^| delays ranging from 1 to 24 months in 83 LGs (78%) out of |<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^| Local Governments. There were instances of extreme delays in LGs extending over two years to 26 years.

MoPS d) Delayed deletion of staff from the salary payroll  I noted that in 78 LGs, a total of UGX 1.13 Bn was paid to 635 staff who had either retired, transferred, absconded or died.  These were payment for services that were not rendered to the LGs, hence loss of funds to Government. This was mainly attributed to delayed communication from supervisors of the affected staff as well as failure to delete affected staff due to lack of validation on the MoPS/ NID interface. |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| e) | Misclassification of salary, pension and gratuity expenditure  3.60 Bn in 33 LGs was charged on account codes other than |<|<|<| I advised the |  \\n||^|<|<|<| Accounting Officers to ensure that wage, pension and gratuity expenditure is charged on  appropriate codes. the |  \\n|^| those prescribed for salary, pension and gratuity. |<|<|<|^|  \\n|^||<|<|<|^|  \\n|^| Misclassification of monitoring as well as the credibility of the financial statements. funds distorts budget performance and Accounting Officers attributed the misclassification to |<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<||  \\n|^| insufficient budget provisions for pensions and gratuity.

The total expenditure for the year was UGX 4,147.90 Bn out of which UGX 2,853.55Bn was spent on employee costs and transfers to other units implying that only UGX.1,294.35 Bn was available for implementation of service delivery outputs.\\n\\nFrom the procedures undertaken, I noted the following significant observations\\n\\n| No Observations Recommendations |<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1.0 | Existence of Strategic plans that are aligned to NDP-III Paragraph 5 of the budget execution circular for the financial | I advised the |  \\n||^| Accounting Officers to |  \\n|^| year 2020/2021 cites poor alignment of Government Budgets | follow up the matter |  \\n|^| with the National Development Plans.

The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was remitted back to the consolidated fund account. Under absorption of released funds results in non- implementation of planned activities and negates the purpose for which funds were disbursed, thereby affecting the achievement of the objectives in the NDPIII. For example, implementation of USMID projects in Municipal Councils and UgIFT projects in DLGs was not undertaken. The Accounting Officers attributed failure to utilise funds to COVID-19 which affected the recruitment exercise, late release of USMID funds and delays in the procurement process and lotting policy of contract works under UgIFT. 2.1 |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|| b) Revenue Performance  i)  The local governments budgeted to receive UGX 217.38 Bn Local Revenue performance |<|<|<|<| I await the outcome of |  \\n||^|<|<|<|<| the  interventions |  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<| instituted by GoU to |  \\n|^| (revised) as total revenue for the year.

The Accounting Officer attributed this to the fact that the Local governments did not receive indicative planning figures from the donors for proper and realistic budgeting for the Financial Year under review. |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\niii) Off Budget Financing/Receipts  \\nI advise Government through the Ministry of Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015 states that all expenditure Finance to negotiate incurred by the government on externally financed projects and mainstream Donor in a financial year shall be appropriated by parliament. funding in the Local Paragraph 29 of the Budget Execution Circular for the Governments Budgeting Financial year states that if an external agency provides Process.  \\nfunds in the course of implementation of the budget or any  \\nfunds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation,  \\nthese must be declared and a supplementary issued in line  \\nwith the Public Finance Management Act 2015.\\n\\nI noted that 17 of the 86 LGs sampled received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX 14.20 Bn, which was never declared to the PS/ST and was also not appropriated by parliament. As such, no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PS/ST. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities, contrary to Section 43(1) of the PFMA 2015 and the budget execution guidelines issued by the PS/ST.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained this was due to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such receipts and in some cases funds are received during the year which were not expected at the time of planning.\\n\\n---\\n\\niv) Quantification of activities and Implementation of I advised the planned outputs  \\nAccounting Officers to ensure that work plans Section 13 (15, b) of the PFMA 2015 states that a policy and budgets are fully statement submitted by a vote shall contain the annual and quantified and ensure three months’ work plans, outputs, targets and performance that  \\nun-implemented indicators of the work plans. Regulation 11 (3) of PFMR 2016  \\nactivities are rolled over requires that a vote prepares a work plan that indicates the to the subsequent outputs of the vote for the financial year; the indicators to periods  \\nfor be used to gauge the performance of the outputs and funds  \\nimplementation. allocated to each activity.\\n\\nI sampled 86 entities for purposes assessing the extent of quantification and implementation of planned outputs I noted that out of the 850 outputs worth UGX 254 Bn sampled for review, 675 outputs (79%) worth UGX 182 Bn were fully quantified, 58 outputs (7%) worth UGX 34 Bn were partially quantified while 117 out puts (14%) worth UGX 38 Bn were not quantified at all.\\n\\nOut of a total of 675 quantified out-puts worth UGX.182 Bn assessed, 475 (70.4%) output worth UGX 90.10 Bn were fully implemented, 172 outputs (25.5%) worth UGX 86.70 Bn were partially implemented, while 28 (4%) out-puts worth UGX 4.90 Bn were not implemented at all. The graph below shows the extent of implementation;\\n\\n**Extent of implementation of quantified out- puts**\\n\\n4% 26%\\n\\n70%\\n\\nFully Implemented  \\nPartially Implemented\\n\\nNot implemented\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that implementation of activities was affected by the restrictions in movement imposed by government to curb the spread of Covid-19 and the fact that staff at the entities were working at 30% staffing levels. Failure to fully quantify the planned activities makes the assessment of implementation difficult while failure to implement planned activities denies citizens services.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2.3.  \\nOperationalization of New Cities\\n\\nDuring the FY 2019/20 Government made a pronouncement upgrading ten (10) Municipal Councils (MCs) to City status effective 1 st July 2020. These include; Arua, Mbarara, Gulu, Jinja Fort portal, Mbale, Masaka, Soroti, Hoima and Lira\\n\\nDuring my audit of the above cities for the F/Year 2020/21, I noted the following;\\n\\ni) Government did not provide funding in the budgets of the newly created entities to enable them operate as cities. I noted that they continued to operate using the budgets of MCs.  \\nii) The High Court in Masaka was petitioned by some individuals to review the guidelines issued by the Minister of Local Governments for the new cities on grounds that they contravened the procedures set out in the Local Government Act.  \\niii) The cities lacked establishment structures against which the recruitment of the required human resource could be undertaken.  \\niv) There was no guidance on the allocation/sharing of assets. This has become a contentious matter between the councils of the newly created cities and those of the hosting districts.\\n\\nAs a result of the above, the high expectations of both the local political leadership and the general public have not been met.\\n\\nI advise Government to ensure that the new cities are fully operationalised.\\n\\n2.2.4.  \\nCapitation Grant for Printing of Home Study Materials\\n\\nThe Government through MoES released UGX 23 Bn for printing of home study materials to facilitate home learning during the COVID 19 lockdown.\\n\\nHowever, I noted that the study materials were not procured and the districts were advised to send the money to the school bank accounts with a condition that they should not spend until instructed to do so.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this report, the home study materials had not been printed and the funds were either used or lying idle on the schools’ bank accounts. Consequently, the objective of ensuring that learners continued to learn during the lockdown was not achieved.  \\nThe Accounting Officers explained that no instructions were given as indicated by the MoES.\\n\\nI advise Government through MoES to always provide timely guidance and coordination in such events that require urgent government interventions.\\n\\nI also recommend that schools are given guidance on the utilization of the funds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2.5. Un-Accounted for Funds\\n\\nSection 43(2) of the of the Local Governments Financial and Accounting Regulations, 2007 require administrative advances to council employees to be authorized by the executive and accounted for within a month.\\n\\nI noted expenditure of UGX 3.37 Bn paid out for implementation of various activities in the LGs remained unaccounted at year-end as shown below\\n\\nTable 11: Entities with unsupported expenditure\\n\\n| Sn | Entity | Amount (UGX) Bn |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1. | ABIM DLG | 1.41 |  \\n| 2\\\\.

The amounts were irregularly expended leading to the overstatement of salary expenditure.\\n\\nI observed that much as there were no payroll deductions made for Apac Municipal Council, Apac Sub County, Chegere Sub County, Ibuje Sub County and Akokoro Sub County, the district transferred a total UGX 0.06 Bn from the wage provisions to the same entities with no justification.\\n\\nAn interview with the Human Resource Officer revealed that these payments were not generated by the Human Resource Department.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that investigations were going on by CID Headquarters.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I have instituted a forensic audit on the matter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2.7.  \\nFailure to submit Financial Statements for consolidation\\n\\nSection 52(1)(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires that the Accountant General shall within three months after the end of each financial year prepare and submit to the Minister and the Auditor General the consolidated annual accounts of the local governments.\\n\\nA review of the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments revealed that 3 District Local Governments and 6 Municipal Councils with a total actual expenditure of UGX 163.08 Bn were not submitted for consolidation by the respective Accounting Officers as shown table below:\\n\\nTable 12 un-consolidated local governmentsSn\\n\\n| SN | Entity | Category | Approved/revised Budget(UGX) Bn | Actual Expenditure (UGX) Bn |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|^|^||^|  \\n| 1 | Arua | DLG | 71.71 | 52.29 |  \\n| 2 Butaleja DLG 31.68 29.84 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 3 | Bududa | DLG | 25.82 | 24.61 |  \\n| 4 Arua MC 23.50 21.85 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 5 | Ntungamo | MC | 8.41 | 6.68 |  \\n| 6 Mityana MC 8.38 8.10 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 7 | Kumi | MC | 6.11 | 5.72 |  \\n| 8 Ibanda MC 11.00 10.25 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 9 | Nebbi | MC | 6.08 | 3.74 |  \\n| Total 192.69 163.08 |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nSource: Consolidated financial statements and schedules\\n\\nThe Accountant General explained that without any justification, the above entities failed to submit the financial statements contrary section 51 of the PFMA, 2015. These accounts were therefore not quality checked for compliance by the Accountant General.\\n\\nFailure to include all individual local government votes in the consolidated financial statements means that the consolidated balances of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities do not represent the actual Local Government consolidated position.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to identify and address the specific challenges that prevented the entities from submitting their Financial Statements for consolidation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2.8.  \\nImplementation of UgIFT project activities\\n\\n**a)**  \\nStatus of completion of projects\\n\\nI undertook audit inspections of civil works in 24 Seed Schools and 41 Health Centre IIs located in a sample of 62 Districts and Municipal Councils and noted that 53 projects (80%) had not been completed, 11 projects (17%) had been completed while 01 project (2%) was not implemented. Notably, Amolatar, Oyam, Luwero, Sironko, Kamwenge and Kanungu Districts completed the construction of the seed schools and Health Centres.\\n\\nThe inspection results are summarised in the table below; Table 13: Status of implementation of UgIFT projects\\n\\n| SN. | Sector | Status of | No. of | %age | Commencement period |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n||<| implementation | projects | Status |<|  \\n| 1 | Education | Completed | 2 | 8.3% | Previous financial year(s) |  \\n| Subtotal Completed and handed over Incomplete 1 20 1 24 4.2% Previous financial year(s) 83.3% Previous financial year(s) 4.2% 2020/2021  100% |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| 2 Health Completed Completed and handed over Incomplete Not implemented Subtotal 3 3 1 1 19 13 1 41 7.3% Previous financial year(s) 7.3% 2020/2021  2.4% Previous financial year(s) 2.4% 2020/2021  46 % Previous financial year(s) 32% 2020/2021  2.4% Not started  100% |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| Grand Total 65 |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nSource: OAG analysis\\n\\nI further noted that out of the 53 incomplete projects, 36projects had exceeded their planned completion dates by an average of 11 months.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the delays in project completion to;\\n\\na) The Covid-19 lockdown measures which limited the movement of materials and labour,  \\nb) The contractors abandoning the sites,  \\nc) Funds not being re-voted to the entities in time,  \\nd) Delayed hybrid procurements,  \\ne) Late release of funds,  \\nf) Poor terrain leading to impassable roads to some projects sites,  \\ng) Low capacity of the contractor in terms of manpower, machinery, and multiple projects.\\n\\nConsequently, the projects planned to be completed within the year were not completed, and as such the intended beneficiaries were denied services.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with the sector Ministries to ensure that the implementation bottlenecks identified above are addressed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**b)** Land Ownership  \\nThe Circular issued by the MoFPED in May 2018 requested all Local Governments to ensure that all Government projects are constructed on land with proof of ownership or a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with landowners;\\n\\nI observed 4 projects that did not have titles or MOUs for the land on which the seed schools and health centers were constructed as shown in the table below:\\n\\nTable 14: UgIFT projects without land titles\\n\\n| SN | District/ | Name  of | Contract price | Amount spent | Status |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| Municipal | project | (UGX) Bn | (UGX) Bn |<|  \\n|^| Council |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 1 | Kamwenge | Construction | 2.02 | 1.92 | Completed |  \\n|| DLG | of Bwizi Seed |<|<| and handed |  \\n|^|| school |<|<| over |  \\n| Mityana 0.66 Incomplete DLG Upgrade of Busunjju HC II to HC III 2 |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| 3 | Kyotera | Upgrade of | 0.66 | 0.28 | Incomplete |  \\n|| DLG | Nyangoma HC |<|<|<|  \\n|^|| II to HC III |<|<|<|  \\n| Moroto DLG Construction 1.94 1.70 Incomplete of Rupa Seed  secondary  school 4 |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| Total |<|<| 5.28 | 3.90 ||  \\n\\n\\nSource: OAG analysis  \\nLack of land titles exposes the projects to disputes.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to acquire land titles or MoUs for all the UgIFT projects.\\n\\n**c)**  \\nProcurement of ICT equipment, Laboratory kits, and chemical reagents  \\nThe guidance on procurement of ICT equipment, science kits, and chemical reagents for seed schools by the Ministry of Education and Sports to all Accounting Officers on 28 th August 2020 referenced EPD 192/335/01; which required the procurement to be conducted after successful completion and handover of the facilities.\\n\\nI noted that ICT equipment, Science kits and chemicals were procured for seed schools that had not been completed. The equipment were instead being kept in inappropriate storage facilities exposing them to a risk of obsolescence.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers pledged to engage the contractors to ensure that construction works on the laboratories are completed.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that procurements for the equipment are only effected when the construction works have been\\n\\n---\\n\\ncompleted. I also urged the Accounting Officer to ensure that items are properly stored.\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer; the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer; and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.\\n\\nI have nothing to report in this regard.  \\nManagement Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the local governments.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the local government’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the local governments’ financial reporting process.\\n\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also;\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the local governments’ internal control.\\n\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the local government’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the local government to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOther Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\nReport on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation  \\nThere were no material findings in respect of the compliance with legislation.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn F.S. Muwanga AUDITOR GENERAL\\n\\n19 th December, 2021\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.3  \\nREPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2021\\n\\n2.3.1. Review of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises\\n\\nAccording to Section 3 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended); “A Public Corporation means an authority established by an Act of Parliament other than a local Government which receives a contribution from public funds, and any public body which in a financial year receives any income from public funds”. Similarly, “A State Enterprise means a body established under any Act other than the Company’s Act or a local Government council, and a company registered under the company’s Act in which the Government or a state enterprise has controlling interest”.\\n\\nIn line with the PFMA, 2015, I reviewed the Consolidated Summary Statement of the Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises for the year ended 30 th June 2021, and noted the following;\\n\\n**a)**  \\nCompleteness of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Performance\\n\\nSection 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires the Accountant General, within three months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Minister responsible for Finance and the Auditor General the consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of Public Corporations, State Enterprises and Companies where Government has controlling interest.\\n\\nI noted that 46 public corporations and state enterprises were supposed to be consolidated in accordance with Section 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015. However, I noted that seven (7) entities were not consolidated in the consolidated summary statement submitted by the Accountant General.\\n\\nFurthermore, Government shareholding in twelve (12) Public Corporations and State Enterprises was not disclosed in the consolidated summary statement of performance. This was caused by the absence of a comprehensive register of Public Corporations and State Enterprises.\\n\\nIn the absence of a complete register of all consolidating public corporations and state enterprises, I was not able to ascertain the completeness of the submitted consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporation and state enterprises.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to establish a comprehensive register of all Public Corporations and State Enterprises with detailed information required for consolidation.\\n\\n**b)**  \\nFailure to submit financial statements for consolidation\\n\\n---\\n\\nSection 51(2) of PFMA, 2015 provides that, the Accounting Officer of a public corporation shall, within two months after the end of each financial year, using the format prescribed by the Accountant-General, prepare and submit to the AccountantGeneral, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury.\\n\\nA review of the consolidated summary statement of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises revealed that two (2) entities did not submit performance returns to the Accountant General for consolidation as indicated in the table 15 below;\\n\\nTable 15: Entities not Consolidated, but Disclosed in summary statement\\n\\n| S/N | Enterprise | Government Holding |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1. | Uganda Air Cargo Corporation | Not ascertained |  \\n| 2\\\\. Uganda Refinery Holding Co  Not ascertained |<|<|  \\n\\n\\n**c)**  \\nMissing Entities in the consolidated summary statement\\n\\nSection 52(1) c of PFMA 2015 as amended requires the Accountant General within three months after the end of each financial year to prepare and submit to the Minister and the Auditor General a consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises and Companies where Government has a controlling interest.\\n\\nI noted that three (3) entities were neither reported nor disclosed in the consolidated summary statement of performance. (Table 16 below refers).\\n\\nTable 16: Entities neither reported nor Disclosed in the consolidated summary statement\\n\\n| S/N | Enterprise | Remarks |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | Uganda National Oil Company Limited | Not reported in the previous year |  \\n| 2  Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium  Not reported in the previous year |<|<|  \\n| 3 | Uganda Crane Industries Ltd. | Not reported in the previous year |  \\n\\n\\nThis implies that the consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises does not reflect the accurate status of government ownership and interest and as such I was unable to assess and conclude on their performance.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to issue comprehensive guidelines in respect of all Public Corporations and state Enterprises to be consolidated to enable assessment of financial performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.4.1 Review of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda (GoU) owns shares in a number of Public Corporations and State Enterprises. These enterprises, which are independently managed, are supposed to operate efficiently, make profits and pay dividends to Government. Their financial performance is therefore of interest to Government.\\n\\nAs noted in my previous reports, the Government Consolidated Summary Statement of financial performance of public corporations and State enterprises only reports on; government shareholding, total income, total expenditure, dividends declared, retained earnings, and net worth of entities. However, key performance assessment parameters, such as; profitability, return on assets, liquidity assessment, long-term debt, and interest cover are not reported on. As a result, I computed these ratios using audited financial statements for further analysis of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises, where applicable.\\n\\nOut of the 46 Public Corporations and State Enterprises, seven (7) entities were not assessed because they had not submitted audited accounts at the time of writing my report. Table 17 below refers;\\n\\nTable 17: Entities not assessed\\n\\n| S/N | Entity | Government Stake |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1. | Uganda National Oil Company Limited | 100% |  \\n| 2\\\\.

This was mainly attributed to government efforts to ease several COVID-19 restrictions, allowing certain businesses to reopen and government intervention of revamping the economy.\\n\\nI further noted that entities including Uganda Railways Corporation, Kilembe Mines Limited, Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) and Uganda National Airlines Company Limited made losses as at the end of the financial year. However, it should be noted that this is the second year of operation of Uganda National Airlines in a highly competitive industry.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the entities to develop clear strategies to improve operations and adopt efficient financial management practices to lower operating costs and increase revenue generation. Government should also consider recapitalizing the most affected entities to revamp their operations.\\n\\nb) Return on Assets\\n\\nThe Return on Assets (ROA) shows the percentage of how a company’s assets are generating revenue. It measures management’s efficiency in using the enterprise’s assets to generate earnings. Although companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets, ROAs below 5% are generally considered inadequate.\\n\\nApart from eleven (11) companies, which include; Uganda Wildlife Conservation education Centre, Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited, Kira Motors Corporation, Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation, Insurance Training College, NEC Constructions Construction Works and Engineering Limited, NEC Uzima, NEC Luwero, Insurance Regulatory Authority of Uganda and National Drug Authority which posted a favourable ROA, the rest of the entities where the ratio is applicable, registered a poor performance on ROA of below 5%.\\n\\nTable 19: Returns on Assets\\n\\n| No. | Entity | Return on Asset (%) |<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|^| 2019/20 | 2020/21 |  \\n| 1\\\\.

Generally, the ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities between 1.5 and 2 is desirable, although acceptable current ratios vary between different industries or sectors.\\n\\nI noted that eighteen (18) entities were above the ideal threshold, implying that they are able to meet their liabilities as they fall due. three (3) entities had ratios below 1.0 and may have a challenge of paying their obligations as and when they fall due. The table 20 below refers.\\n\\nTable 20: Enterprise Liquidity\\n\\n||| Current Ratio |<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| No | Entity | 2020/21 26.24 | 2019/20 9.9 |  \\n| 1\\\\.

Relatedly, the loan to deposit ratio averaged to 66% up from 64% which is still desirable at individual bank rating.

Interest cover looks at how many times a Company’s operating profits exceed its interest payable. A cover of two (2) times and above is usually considered to be safe, depending on the nature of industry. The implication is that a company is most likely to meet its interest payments.\\n\\nI noted that of the 3 companies/enterprises which were financing loans, two (2) (NWSC and the Insurance Training College) were better placed to meet their interest obligations, while the New Vision Printing and Publishing Company Limited was not. The Table 23 below refers.\\n\\nTable 23: Enterprises\\' ability to service loan obligations\\n\\n| No. Entity Profit Before Interest Interest (Financing cost) Interest Cover (No. of times) (2020/21 Interest Cover (No. of times) (2019/20 |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | National Water and | 18.68 | 6.95 | 2.7 | 28.3 |  \\n|| Sewerage |<|<|<|<|  \\n|^| Corporation |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 2 New Vision Printing and  Publishing Company Limited (0.34) 0.59 -0.6 28.2 |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| 3 | Insurance Training | 2.42 | 1.06 | 2.30 | 0.001 |  \\n|| college |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nOverall Conclusion/Recommendation\\n\\nWhereas government policy to invest in critical sectors of the economy is commendable, it is important to ensure that such investments are operating efficiently and effectively to meet sector objectives. There is need for government to strengthen the supervision and monitoring of these entities.\\n\\nAlthough government efforts to ease several COVID-19 restrictions, allowing certain businesses to reopen improved performance of certain enterprises, the COVID 19 pandemic affected operations of a number of entities, and Government needs to assess its impact on the critical enterprises and corporations and provide the necessary guidance and assistance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPART 3: SECTORAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CROSS CUTTING FINDINGS\\n\\nThis part contains cross cutting key findings noted in the respective sectors and cross cutting service delivery issues in Local Governments.\\n\\n3.0. Sectoral Key Findings  \\n3.1. PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT  \\n3.1.1. Government readiness to implement the programmatic approach\\n\\nGovernment with effect from 1 st July 2020 started the implementation of NDP III as a successor plan to the NDP II. The overall objective of the NDP III is to increase household income and improving the quality of life of Ugandans. This plan is implemented using the programme approach to planning, budgeting, implementation and results reporting. This programme was also designed to address challenges faced in implementation of prior national development programmes which included uncoordinated planning, weak harmonization, limited sequencing of programmes, and poor linkages between outcomes and outputs.\\n\\nI reviewed the readiness of government to effectively implement the NDP III in order to achieve the desired outcomes. From the procedures undertaken, I noted that significant strides have been made towards effective implementation of the plan.\\n\\nAreas of commendable performance include; provision of guidelines to entities to facilitate transitioning to programme approach, development of the Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) for all programmes, development of strategic plans that are aligned to the NDP III by a number of entities in government, operationalization of Programme Working Groups (PWGs) to coordinate programme activities and development of guidelines for the programme working groups.\\n\\nDespite these achievements, there are a number of areas that need government attention if the NDP III overall objective is to be achieved. These include;\\n\\na) The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting requires tracking progress towards attainment of results. This therefore implies that accountability and oversight processes should be re-aligned towards achievement of results as defined in the NDP III framework. This realignment has however not been fully attained.\\n\\nb)  \\nThe shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also requires a shift of the current government statistical processes to processes that are capable of delivering outcome statistics as defined in the NDP III. The current data systems therefore have to be revised so that they produce results data rather than output data. In addition, surveys and production of key results statistics need to be aligned to the NDP III M&E processes to enable real time capture of data and monitoring of the achievement of programme results.\\n\\nc)  \\nThe shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also implies that government annual performance reporting will now be based on programmes rather than sectors. The challenge however is that a number of programme\\n\\n---\\n\\nworking groups are still struggling to constitute themselves in order to do effective programme reporting which is likely to affect effective coordination and supervision of programme activities.\\n\\nd) The shift from sector to programme planning and budgeting also implies that budgets of MDAs and LGs are now developed and approved at programme level although appropriation and spending remain at vote level. However, a number of MDAs are grappling with understanding the new system.\\n\\nWith 2 years into the implementation of NDP III, a number of MDAs and LGs have not fully transitioned their operations to the new programme based planning and budgeting and this is likely to affect the achievements of the NDP III objectives.\\n\\nGovernment should support the National Planning Authority in capacity building of MDAs and LGs staff such as planners, monitoring and evaluation officers among others to equip them with the necessary skills to track and evaluate the implementation of entity plans in line with the NDP III PIAPs.\\n\\n3.1.2. Limited efforts to build the capacity of planning units within Government\\n\\nSection 7 (2) (d) provides that in pursuance of its primary planning functions, the Authority shall support local capacity development for national planning and, in particular, provide support and guidance to the national and local bodies responsible for the decentralized planning process.\\n\\nI have noted over the years that MDAs and Local Governments face significant challenges in planning, implementing, monitoring and reporting performance due to low capacity of their planning units. I however noted that although the mandate of the Authority provides for supporting the development of local capacity in planning, the Authority had not effectively executed this mandate. No trainings for planners had been undertaken by the Authority in the past three (3) years as a deliberate strategy to build planning capacity both at national and local levels.\\n\\nFailure to build planning capacity within the Government implies that there will be persistent challenges in the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of performance in relation to the approved budgets, which affects service delivery and the credibility of the budgets both at entity and government-wide level.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Authority developed a National Capacity Enhancement Project for strengthening planning capacity at decentralized level in 2017 however no funds were availed and the activity has persistently remained as an unfunded priority.\\n\\nI advised Government to have this critical activity funded, especially with the implementation of the roll out of the new NDP III which has taken effect.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.2. SECURITY SECTOR\\n\\n3.2.1.  \\nMonitoring and Supervision of Government Programmes under Office of the President\\n\\nThe Office of the President is mandated to follow up implementation of government programmes across the Country. However, the Office has staffing as well as office accommodation challenges which has limited adequate monitoring and supervision of the implementation of the programmes. The Office has a staffing gap of 80 positions of Senior Presidential Advisors, Resident District Commissioners and Deputy Resident District Commissioners.\\n\\nIn addition to the staffing gap, the RDCs lack enough accommodation. During the year under review, the Office of the President had a deployment of 146 RDCs in Districts and 10 RCCs in newly created cities out of which 107 are renting and 24 lack offices.\\n\\nIn order to address the above challenge, the Office envisioned an idea of constructing at least 10 RDC offices per annum in a phased approach starting with FY 2008/09. This idea was not fulfilled because government could not fund the capital budget as anticipated. This has necessitated the Office of the President to revert to constructing only one RDC office per annum as the case is currently and renting office space for the rest. Under this approach, the Office will take 107 years to construct offices for all RDCs and spend approximately UGX.445Million on rent annually.\\n\\nI have advised Government to ensure that the RDCs and RCCs are recruited and also develop an action plan for construction of offices in a phased manner to minimise the high operation costs.\\n\\n3.3. AGRICULTURE SECTOR  \\n3.3.1. Mainstreaming of Agriculture Sector agencies\\n\\nGovernment is still in the process of rationalizing agencies and public expenditure (RAPEX) under the Agricultural Sector which include Cotton Development Organisation, Uganda Coffee Development Authority, Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis and Diary Development Authority. These entities have had challenges of attracting staff to undertake activities. The respective Accounting Officers attributed this challenge to the following:\\n\\n- Some successful candidates did not take up the job offers because the contract period was limited to only 18 months as recommended by Ministry of Public Service.\\n\\n- The Ministry of Public Service and Solicitor General guided that recruitment of staff for the agencies affected by rationalization should only be for a period up to June 2023.\\n\\n- The employment contracts should contain a disclaimer clause to the effect that the employment can be terminated any time without recourse.\\n\\n- There is no guarantee of retention of the workforce.\\n\\nThe above situation has affected the agencies also in other areas of planning, execution of activities and implementation of the new NDP III strategic plans.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised Government to fast-track implementation of the policy with a view of ensuring that the on-going rationalization activities are finalized in the shortest time possible to avoid further disruptions in the operations.\\n\\n3.3.2. Over dependence on the Public Private Partnership in the Cotton sector\\n\\nSection 5 (i) of the Cotton Development Organisation Act, vests the duty to facilitate cotton production, cotton research and extension through the Ministry responsible for agriculture to CDO. CDO’s mandate is to promote production, monitor marketing and processing of cotton and represent all aspects of the cotton subsector.\\n\\nOver the last 11 years, the Private Sector (Ginners) under their umbrella body Uganda Ginners and Cotton Exporters Association (UGCEA), have been supporting cotton production activities under the Cotton Production Support Program through a Memorandum of Understanding that is signed annually between CDO and UGCEA. The Program, using funds pooled voluntarily by UGCEA members into the Cotton Development Fund (CDF), supports a variety of activities which aim to assist cotton farmers in Uganda to increase cotton production and productivity through; provision of inputs, farmer mobilization and sensitization, extension services and agricultural mechanization.\\n\\nIt was noted that UGX.19.649Bn was budgeted to cater for the cotton marketing season 2020/21 out of which, UGX.15.154Bn was budgeted towards provision of planting seed and production inputs. Government was able to contribute only UGX.8.6Bn leaving the balance for the private partner intervention. This is an indication that government is relying more on the ginners to fund the cotton sector.\\n\\nDespite the intervention by the private sector, there were shortages in provision of inputs to farmers. From table below, 866 Mt of planting seed, 374.6 Mt of fertilizers and 2,260 spray pumps were not provided as projected in the strategic plan despite the support from the Ginners which directly affected the performance of the sector in achieving the desired cotton production targets.\\n\\nTable 24: Comparison of consolidated quantities of production inputs\\n\\n|| Planting | Pesticides | Fertilizers | Spray | Herbicides |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| seed |<|<| pumps |<|  \\n| Production needed(Strategic Plan) A inputs 3,200 Mt 222,000 415 Mt 7,000 0 liters |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| Planned Quantities (MOU- | 2,500Mt | 224,000 | 746 Mt | 3,000 | 7,500 liters |  \\n| Ginners) B |<| liters |<|<|<|  \\n| Actual (Reports) C Quantities provided 2,334 Mt 287,102 40.4 Mt 4,740 6,616 liters liters |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| Difference A - C | 866 Mt | (65,102) | 374.6 Mt | 2,260 | (6,616) |  \\n||<|<|<|<| Liters |  \\n\\n\\nSource: OAG analysis of CDO Strategic Plan 2020/21-20, MOU, quarterly reports\\n\\n---\\n\\nDependency on the Private sector for a key production activity such as provision of seed for planting and production inputs, risks the sustainability of the sector and enables the private sector to exercise influence over farmers through paying of low prices for the farmers’ crops. Further, inadequate Government funding limits CDO’s interventions in key aspects such as targeted extension services for mobilizing farmers and training them on cotton agronomical practices using demonstration gardens established at village/parish level.\\n\\nManagement explained that limited government has affected the cotton production in the past 2 years. There was a drop in cotton production from 173,457 bales of lint in FY 2019/20 to 50,709 bales in the year under review largely as a result of heavy rains, meagre funds for procurement and distribution of production inputs as well as provision of extension services. The calamity of drop in the cotton production was brought to the attention of both the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry & Fisheries and the Ministry of Finance, Planning & Economic Development and a request for a supplementary budget of UGX.5 billion was made.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting officer to continue liaising with the line Ministry and MoFPED to forge a way forward for the sector.\\n\\n3.3.3. Management of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Outbreaks in the Country\\n\\nIt is the Mandate of MAAIF to regulate and control the prevalence of FMD within the country. Accordingly, Government intervened by procuring FMD vaccines from Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute (KEVEVAPI) and Botswana Vaccines Institute (BVI) which were distributed to farmers across the country especially in the areas where FMD has been reported previously.\\n\\nIn June 2021, the country was informed of unprecedented outbreaks of FMD along the cattle corridor. A review of management of the outbreak revealed failure of timely interventions as a result of challenges faced in the procurement of vaccines despite the availability of funds. Furthermore, the following shortcomings were noted;\\n\\na) During the financial year 2019/2020, 700,000 doses of FMD were procured in November 2019, however, only 500,000 (70%) of the consignment was delivered and significantly late by 4 months.\\n\\nb) 2,311,000 doses were planned to be procured in 2019/2020 however the supplier failed to deliver despite emergency situation and sensitivity of the disease.\\n\\nc) Although the supplier later delivered 1,700,000 doses (52%) during the year 2020/2021, and 2021/2022 financial year, the balance of 611,000 doses (24%) were still outstanding at the time of writing this report. The deliveries have not been made even after several delivery extensions to the supplier.\\n\\nThe continued presence of the FMD and the inadequate response in terms of vaccine availability has denied Ugandans opportunities to export livestock and livestock products to the international market and significantly curtails the Ministry’s ability to achieve its mandate.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to effectively and efficiently monitor such disease outbreaks within the Country so as to curb the spread and prevent further loss to the Community. Further, research collaborations with NARO should be enhanced for development of a local intervention.\\n\\n3.4.  \\nJUSTICE LAW AND ORDER SECTOR\\n\\n3.4.1.  \\nManagement of cases and Case backlog\\n\\nVarious stakeholders in the Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS) have implemented a number of management information systems as indicated in the table 25 below.\\n\\nTable 25: Information Systems within the JLOS Sector\\n\\n| SN | Information system | Purpose | Entity | Cost (Bn) |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | Prosecution  Case | Record and collect information | ODPP | 26.188 |  \\n|| Management | pertaining to cases, and rapidly transfer |<|<|  \\n|^| Information  System | case details from law enforcement |<|<|  \\n|^| (PROCAMIS) | across the DPP offices. |<|<|  \\n| Case System Court Administration (CCAS) Receiving and allocating cases to different Judicial officers for further management.

In pursuance on the goals of criminal justice, various entities within the sector have acquired computerised information management systems to enable them attain their mandate.\\n\\nAlthough Government has invested a sum of UGX.36.46Bn in four of the systems for the administration of Justice across the JLOS sector, I noted that the systems are stand- alone and decentralized without being integrated to enable information sharing across the sector.\\n\\nThe lack of systems’ integration inter-linking the various entities such as the Police, Directorate of Prosecution, Judiciary and Prisons implies that the transfer of case details between stakeholders for the quick resolution of cases in the pursuit of Justice cannot be achieved. The absence of shared or integrated management systems may also result in inefficient allocation of resources, higher costs of procurement for IT hardware, network equipment and application software as well as duplications in the nature of service support from the suppliers/vendors of the applications and the hardware.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI also observed that the implementation or setup of some of the systems is still ongoing in various entities. For instance, the Crime Records Management System in Uganda Police, the Prisoner’s Information Management System in the Uganda Prisons, the Electronic Court Case Management Information System in Judiciary, the Suspect Profiling System in Uganda Police were still at the pilot testing stage or were yet to be fully rolled out and operationalised across all the regional offices countrywide.\\n\\nThis may have resulted in the non-optimal use of the information assets held on the systems.\\n\\nThe JLOS sector should review the existing systems and their functionality vis-à-vis the sector-wide needs with a view of achieving an integrated approach to information management within the sector, in order to avoid the duplication of data, delays in processing cases, and achieving efficiency in resource allocation across the sector so as to attain the goals of criminal justice administration.\\n\\n3.4.2.  \\nOperationalisation of the Joint Venture Agreement\\n\\nIn 2017 the Government of Uganda entered into a Joint Venture Agreement resulting in the formulation of the Uganda Securities Printing Company (USPC) for the exclusive production and supply of all security documents for the Government of Uganda, including National Identity Cards and Birth and Deaths Certificates. This venture had delayed to be operationalised and as a result a number of challenges were identified;\\n\\na) NIRA was expected to order a minimum of 4,500,000 national ID cards annually, starting with the financial year 2020/2021. However, no order was placed for the financial year under review due to lack of budget provisions for this activity. This is a breach of the contract agreement, which may result in the payment of fines for breach of contract.\\n\\nb) USPC was yet to supply IT systems and equipment to support the National ID system and the birth and death registration system. The system in use for Identification Information was supplied by M/S Mühlbauer Uganda Limited, whose contract had expired and was not renewed. There is a risk that NIRA will operate without system support from the system vendor of the legacy (existing) system for an unspecified time.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Authority has been engaging USPC to resolve all the issues relating to the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and an Adhoc committee had been put in place comprising of all Permanent secretaries, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose objective is to review the status of implementation of the JVA every quarter.\\n\\nI advised Government to design a clear road map and strategy to ensure compliance with the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, including developing support systems to avoid the stalling of operations of the entity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.5. INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR\\n\\n3.5.1.  \\nAbsence of a National IT Governance/Oversight System\\n\\nI noted that Government did not have a national IT governance framework that establishes a proper IT governance structure and system.\\n\\nThe objective of an IT Governance system is to enable Government to; provide for strategic direction for ICT investments; prioritise and ensure strategic alignment of IT and e-government investments across Government; mitigate risks associated with the use and/or investments in ICT such as duplication of IT systems and wasteful expenditure; and optimise the use of ICT and e-government services, among others.\\n\\nAs a result, there is a lack of strategic insight in IT investments, and the Government may fail to optimise the use of existing ICT infrastructure. In addition, the Country lacks competitiveness in harnessing opportunities in ICT.\\n\\nI advised Government to consider establishing a national IT Governance Framework and structure to oversee investments in information and communication technologies.\\n\\n3.5.2.  \\nFailure by MDAs to Pay for National Backbone Infrastructure Services\\n\\nNITA-U provides NBI/EGI services to MDAs and Local Governments whose ICT budgets have been either consolidated or not consolidated under NITA-U\\'s ICT budget. Currently, fifty-four (54) entities whose ICT budget is consolidated under the ICT sector budget, while the ICT budget for 72 entities are not consolidated. Out of seventy-two (72) entities, only ten (10) entities have honoured their obligations. This has led to the accumulation of domestic arrears totalling UGX.22.96Bn as of 30th June 2021.\\n\\nThe arrears largely relate to the costs of expanding the national backbone/e- Government infrastructure (NBI/EGI). Notably, domestic arrears accounted for 14% of the annual GoU budget for the Authority, which is not only unsustainable but may lead to difficulties in the provision and extension of e-government services throughout the Country.\\n\\nI advised management to liaise with MoFPED in consultation with MDAs to ensure that the ICT budgets are consolidated under the ICT Sector budget.\\n\\n3.5.3.  \\nUncollected Revenue from Media Operators\\n\\nI noted that UCC stopped invoicing government bodies, namely: Uganda Telecom Limited (in-Administration), Uganda Broadcasting Corporation and Uganda Post Limited, for licensing and other charges. A review of the financial statements of these Government agencies revealed an un-invoiced amount of UGX.50.9 Bn. Management attributed it to the financial distress of these companies and the URA\\'s tax policy of invoicing for VAT based on invoices raised by taxpayers, whether paid or not.\\n\\nI noted that UCC did not issue invoices worth UGX.421.9Million to 15 operators (4 television operators and 11 FM broadcasting stations) during the period under review, contrary to its financial regulations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nRelatedly, UCC has not enforced the payment of a 2% gross annual levy on the licensed Television and FM radio operators gazetted in 2017, contrary to Section 68(1) of the UCC Act 2013. Management explained that the operators had appealed to the Minister of Information, Communication Technology & National Guidance.\\n\\nI advised management to engage all stakeholders and collect the levies due.\\n\\n3.5.4.  \\nLack of a Communications Tribunal\\n\\nDuring the audit, I observed that the Commission does not have a Tribunal contrary to Sections 60(1 & 2) and 64(1) of the Uganda Communications Act, 2013. The tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters relating to communications services arising from decisions made by the Commission or the Minister under this Act.\\n\\nIn the absence of the tribunal, the Commission lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine matters arising from decisions made by the Commission or the Minister under this Act. Currently, the matters are being heard by the Minister and the Commission, which creates a conflict of interest.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the responsibility to appoint the tribunal does not reside with the Commission and that the tribunal is to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, and that the matter had been brought to the attention of the Minister of ICT and National Guidance.\\n\\nI advised management and the Board of Directors to liaise with the relevant authorities to constitute the Communications Tribunal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.6. ACCOUNTABILITY SECTOR\\n\\n3.6.1.  \\nApproval of supplementary funding without matching revenue\\n\\nIt was established that during the financial year ended 30 th June 2021, supplementary funding totalling UGX.6.13Tn was granted by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. It was however, noted that the source of funding for the supplementary expenditure was not clearly shown before approval was granted.\\n\\nAs a result, the supplementary expenditure was instead financed by internal budget cuts from various votes, thus affecting the implementation of plans/activities by the affected votes. Although the budget was raised from UGX.45.495Tn to UGX.51.625Tn, only UGX.46.6Tn was realised, resulting in unfunded activities worth UGX.4.98Tn.\\n\\n3.6.2.  \\nUnderperformance in Revenue Collection\\n\\nI observed that, URA had a total revenue collection target of UGX.22.04Tn for the financial year 2020/21 and collected total gross revenue of UGX.19.65Tn (89%) hence a shortfall of UGX.2.39Tn (11%). Under collection of revenue affects cash flow performance of Government and realisation of the planned service delivery targets. In addition, it may increase the national debt burden as the Country may fail to honour its obligations and borrow more to address revenue shortfalls. Management attributed the performance to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nI advised management to continue implementing strategies to enhance revenue collection.\\n\\n3.6.3.  \\nPerformance of the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP)\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2020/2021, the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP) registered only 167,211 taxpayers against a target of 436,869 taxpayers representing 38.27% registration success a shortfall of 61.7%. In revenue terms, although TREP had a revenue target of UGX.124.58 Bn in FY 2020/21, it had only collected UGX.49.93Bn by 30th June 2021, representing a 40% performance rate. In addition, the Ministry of Local Government had planned to implement activities worth UGX.4.4Bn under TREP activities but only implemented activities worth UGX.3.3Bn, leaving un-implemented activities worth UGX.1.1Bn despite receiving full funding. As a result, the e-LogRev objective of simplifying and strengthening the local revenue collection systems for Local Governments may not be achieved in time.  \\nThe paltry performance was attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that has set back many businesses, political riots and limited staff at the various stations because URA TREP officers had been laid off, thus resulting in limited staff capacity to conduct enforcement.\\n\\nI advised the project management to review their strategies to enhance performance by agreeing on improvement plans to meet the project target.\\n\\n3.6.4.  \\nOverstay of projects in the Public Investment Plan (PIP)-UGX.39.01Tn\\n\\nThe Public Investment Management Reform Strategy provides that projects are supposed to be delivered on budget and on time in order to achieve the desired goals and objectives.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAudit observed that in the sample of 371 projects, 342 projects with budgets totalling to UGX.39Tn had gone past their planned exit periods that date as far back as the FY2010/11, with some projects having been extended for more than 12 years. The audit noted that the projects continued to receive Development Committee approval for a continued stay on the PIP. It was noted that only 40% of the projects in the PIP were still within their expected time period.\\n\\nAs a result, this has caused delays in the completion of key projects, cost overruns and high commitment fees on foreign debt on account of low Absorption and failure to complete projects on time. It should also be noted that the effectiveness of some projects dwindles as time goes by.\\n\\nThe PS/ST was advised to critically review the justification for maintaining certain projects within the Country\\'s Public Investment Plan.\\n\\n3.6.5.  \\nUn recovered Advances; UGX.2,819,193,074\\n\\nMoFPED introduced a policy to advance funds to entities before actual collection of Appropriation in Aid on the condition that these funds will be recovered after collection. The policy failed in the FY2018/19 and 2019/20 due to failure to recover funds fully.\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2018/19, entities were advanced Appropriation in Aid, of which UGX.22.16Bn remained outstanding as at year-end. During the year 19/20, UGX.21.31Bn was recovered, leaving UGX.849 million outstanding.\\n\\nIt was also noted that during the financial year 2020/21, a total of UGX.116.9Bn was again advanced in disregard of what had happened earlier to various Local Governments. Out of the funds advanced, UGX.114.07Bn was recovered, leaving UGX.2.81Bn outstanding.\\n\\n3.6.6.  \\nAbsence of a monitoring and evaluation framework for impact assessment for tax exemptions\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda has offered many beneficiaries\\' tax benefits, including tax holidays, waivers for tax payments, and refunding of various taxes as stipulated in various agreements and memorandum of understanding. The benefits are granted based on intended objectives that include promotion of economic growth, increasing employment, facilitation for extension of social services by Non-Government Organisations, among others.\\n\\nIt was, however, noted that there is no mechanism in place for evaluating and or assessing the impact of the benefits granted. Analysis revealed that a number of beneficiaries have since had their benefit period expired without any follow up.\\n\\nIn the absence of a monitoring framework, Government is not in a position to assess the impact of the tax benefits granted to the various beneficiaries.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer was advised to review the tax exemption Policy and set up a monitoring mechanism to follow up all tax incentive beneficiaries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.7. ENERGY SECTOR\\n\\n3.7.1.  \\nCapitalization of Uganda National Oil Company and its Subsidiary Companies\\n\\nUganda National Oil Company (UNOC) is charged with a mandate of representing Government of Uganda’s Commercial interests in Oil and Gas Sector. The Company is strategically positioned to participate in the down-stream, middle-stream and the up- stream of the oil and gas value chain, thereby engaging in the exploration, production and commercialization activities. The Company is anticipated to fully participate in the exploration and production in the Albertine Graben; the oil refinery and the oil pipeline. As a result, UNOC has registered two flag ship Subsidiary Companies to champion its commercial interests. These include; the Uganda Refinery Holding Company for the refinery business, and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline Company to lead in the pipeline business.\\n\\nI noted that despite the significant initial investment requirements by UNOC and its subsidiary companies, the government has not fully capitalized the companies to enable their full participation in the sector. The companies are consistently facing funding constraints. For the period under review, I noted that out of the Budget of UGX.76.38Bn for UNOC, only UGX.34.4Bn was availed, resulting in a funding gap of UGX41.98Bn, which is 54.96% of the budget.\\n\\nAfter the Final Investment Decision for the Upstream and EACOP Project, which is envisaged to be undertaken in February 2022, there will be a rapid increase of oil and gas activities which will cause an exponential growth in the financing needs of the Companies.  \\nUNOC has proposed a capitalization plan to MOFPED in its annual work programme and budget for the FY 2021/22 of UGX.914.18Bn comprising Capital expenditure (UGX.304.08Bn) and Operating expenditure (UGX.129.10Bn).\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that he was engaging MOFPED and other stakeholders to secure finances to that magnitude, and a plan has been agreed with government on a phased approach towards capitalizing UNOC and its subsidiary companies.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to fast-track their discussions with MoFPED to ensure adequate capitalization of the companies to enable government commercial participation in the strategic oil and gas sector.\\n\\n3.7.2.  \\nImplementation of the Electricity Connection Policy(ECP)\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda established the Electricity Connections Policy (ECP), 2018 which is expected to run from 2018 to 2027. The primary objective of the policy is to increase electricity access, and provide cleaner energy to Ugandans. The policy aims at achieving the 26% rural access target by 2022, 30% national coverage target by 2020 and accelerating access after 2020 in order to achieve 60% access rate by the year 2027.\\n\\nI noted from the review of the Connections Department work plans and progress reports for the year under review that out of the 97,000 annual planned connections, only 3,683 (3.7%) connections were undertaken. The dismal performance may frustrate the Government’s initiatives under the Policy and NDP III of increasing electricity access to the population to 60% by 2027.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI further noted that the ECP was facing challenges in delayed procurement of connection materials, under funding of compensations for the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), vandalism of the distribution network, among others.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the funding for the Connection Policy got exhausted and the Policy was first suspended by Government. However, it resumed in March 2021 to facilitate connections by utilizing materials procured with funding from African Development Bank (ADB). He further explained, that Rural Electrification Program (REP) had secured approval from AFD to utilize the grant for connections intended to benefit 45,000 customers under the result-based implementation arrangement with the expected implementation to start by March 2022, and the connection materials are expected under the TBEA/Exim Bank contract which will benefit over 172,000 customers by June 2022.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the relevant stakeholders such as MoFPED and MEMD, to devise Sustainable funding strategies and ensure that implementation of the ECP is fast tracked for the achievement of policy objectives and service delivery.\\n\\n3.7.3.  \\nVandalism and Theft of UETCL Grid Assets\\n\\nUganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UECTCL is charged with bulk evacuation of power using High Voltage (220Kv and 132Kv). The Company majorly uses steel Towers for the construction of the Transmission Lines. During the year it incurred UGX.0.5Bn in purchase of Galvanized Angle bars to replace vandalized tower members. Further analysis revealed that the Company incurred UGX 1.56Bn in replacement costs on assorted transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that this was a nationwide vice that has been brought to the attention of Cabinet and Security Agencies. In addition, Management installed a pilot security system on transmission lines, however the system was itself vandalized. Nevertheless, management continues to engage security agencies and also community policing to protect UETCL installations.\\n\\nVandalism impedes continuity and reliability of electricity supply to the country and strains company resources used to replace vandalized items and associated works. In addition, energy not transmitted due to infrastructure breakdown translates into loss in revenue to the company.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to continue engaging the MoFPED and MEMD in order to obtain funding for Implementation of Key Projects and follow up with the relevant stakeholders to fast-track amendment of the relevant legislation and promotion of Joint Ventures and negotiation of Commercial Partnerships.\\n\\n3.7.4.  \\nDeemed Energy Purchases: UGX.87.7 Billion and Power Evacuation Losses UGX.15.29 Billion\\n\\nDeemed energy refers to the electric power that is available for dispatch by an Independent Power Producer (IPP), but due to; non-existent or a weak grid infrastructure, and/ or insufficient demand, the power is not dispatched. This effectively transfers the market risk from the investors to Government, especially when the Power Purchase Agreement states so.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAccording to several Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and other implementation agreements signed between the IPPs, GOU, and UETCL; GOU committed to construct power evacuation infrastructure from the IPP’s generation facilities to the distribution network upon commencement of generation and dispatch of power by IPPs. The failure to dispatch generated power constitutes deemed energy, and UETCL shall make payments to IPPs for such energy generated and not dispatched in accordance with the power purchase agreement.\\n\\nI noted that UETCL continues to pay significant amounts relating to deemed energy purchases. As a result, deemed energy costs of UGX.87.7 billion in regard to thirteen (13) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), save for one Hydro Power Plant (HPP), were financed through the electricity tariff system, hence negatively impacting on the electricity price to the final consumer.\\n\\nSimilarly, I noted that UEDCL incurred an amount UGX.15.20Bn from power evacuation losses payable to UETCL for bulk power purchases. The amount is due to power evacuation losses stemming from absence of transmission lines to evacuate electricity from PA Technical, Siti 1 and Arpe Power Plants which resulted into wheeling power over a lower capacity and weaker distribution lines operated by UEDCL. These are significant losses for which the Company did not generate economic value. Payment of this amount would significantly affect the Company’s cash flows.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to continue engaging the Regulator and other sector players to address the infrastructural constraints in the transmission network to ensure efficient evacuation of generated power.\\n\\n3.7.5.  \\nDelayed Commissioning of Karuma HPP\\n\\nAccording to the 4th Quarter Progress Report, I noted that the completion date for Karuma Dam was further extended to 15th June 2022, resulting in a delay of 3 years and 6 months from the initial planned completion date due to unfinished works such as the spillway rehabilitation and other minor defects.\\n\\nI noted that the completion of land acquisition process or the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the 132kV Karuma-Lira Transmission Line and Karuma Dam Reservoir by UTECL and MEMD, respectively, remain outstanding. These when not completed will affect the commissioning of the Karuma Dam and is a breach of the employer’s obligations under the EPC Contract with significant risk to the overall project completion.\\n\\nThe delays in Project completion are likely to result in increased supervision costs, by the supervising consultant, and increased commitment fees payable on undrawn balances of the loan, of which GoU had already paid commitment fees amounting to UGX.2.9Bn as at 30th June 2021. It also reduces the period between commissioning, commercialization and payback which may have implications on the electricity tariff structure.\\n\\nI further noted Key Non-conformities by the EPC Contractor which included; 11kV switchgears installation, Units 1 to 6 ring gate leakage oil sump control box, severe damages on the various 400kV cables, damaged conic sealing surfaces, repair of the oil water separator unit, prolonged spillway operation, Outgoing Line Yard – cracks in the Control Building and absence of a Floating Boom.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere is a risk that the non-conformities will result into damages, malfunction of equipment, unreliable plant components, and significant impact on working life duration and high operation and maintenance costs, as well as, negative environmental impact. This is likely to further affect the timely and successful commissioning of the Karuma Dam.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the rectification of pending works under the Karuma Dam is expedited to enable project completion and commissioning without further delay.\\n\\n3.7.6.  \\nBottlenecks in the Compensation of Project Affected Persons(PAPs) under Transmission Line Projects\\n\\nThe Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (UETCL) is mandated to augment government’s efforts of increasing electricity coverage and expanding the national power transmission line network. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Seven (7) and Nine (9) both aim at increased electricity access by 2030.The electricity transmission sector has been affected by delayed construction and energizing of transmission lines. The delay has contributed to the low electricity consumption rates in the country of 215 KWh per capita per year, which is below the Sub-Saharan Africa’s average of 552Kwh per capita per year. The delayed construction has further more resulted into low uptake of borrowed funds, leading to increased costs, such as commitment fees paid.\\n\\nThe delays in undertaking the construction of the transmission lines have been majorly attributed to inadequacies in the compensation process of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), thus leading to challenges faced in “Acquisition of the Right of Way” (ROW). This has in turn led to delayed implementation of a number of projects in the Energy Sector. A review of the compensation process under UETCL revealed the following irregularities;\\n\\ni)  \\nThe budgeting, disbursement, and absorption of compensation funds were not properly managed which resulted into over budgeting to the tune of UGX.111.3Bn on GERP and Mputa projects.\\n\\nii)  \\nThe valuation process was marred with a number of irregularities, which included the use of un-updated district compensation rates; and unverified legal interests in the land; which resulted into unnecessary revaluations and ligation.\\n\\niii)  \\nAbout 56% of the PAPs for GERP and Mputa projects were not properly identified, and this resulted into a mismatch between the number of PAPs appearing on the Payment files, Survey reports and Valuation Reports.\\n\\niv)  \\nOf the released compensation amount of UGX.21.5Bn for both GERP and Mputa Projects, only UGX.5.86Bn was paid to PAPs, thus resulting into unspent funds to the tune of UGX.15.64Bn. This mostly affected the GERP Project which alone had UGX.13.17Bn not utilized, while Mputa had only UGX.1.66Bn.\\n\\nv)  \\nThere were significant delays in compensation of PAPs. 1,109 PAPs (52.2%) for Mputa and 821 (35%) for the GERP Transmission Line remained unpaid by the time of concluding the audit (November, 2021). Relatedly, Compensations in kind also delayed whereby out of 149 PAPs identified, only 93 were resettled, leaving 56 PAPs not resettled.\\n\\n---\\n\\nvi) There were inadequacies in the construction of the resettlement houses which included; irregular payments to contractors, delayed progress of works, discrepancies in drawing specifications and BOQs, poor materials used for construction, and a number of defects which were not rectified.\\n\\nTimely compensations of project affected persons (PAPs) and acquisition of the right of way for electricity transmission lines would enable increased access to electricity by the citizens as envisaged in the sustainable development goals; 7 and 9. This would have a multiplier effect on industrialization which is critical for creation of employment and ultimately poverty reduction in the country.\\n\\nI advised management to streamline its RAP processes, including proper identification of PAPs, clear valuation processes, proper budgeting and release of funds, timely submission of PAP documentation and proper supervision of RAP activities.\\n\\n3.8.  \\nGENDER AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR\\n\\n3.8.1. Labour Externalization Inadequacies\\n\\nLabour externalization is a process whereby government undertakes to regulate the export of labour to foreign countries. This role is under the mandate of the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD). This activity involves the signing of Bi-lateral Migrant Agreements (BLMA) with destination countries. I noted that the country has only 3 BLMAs with destination countries namely; Saudi Arabia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. However, a review of the ministry records indicated that the country was exporting labour to more than 3 countries, such as; Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, among others.\\n\\nI noted that the Ministry had no mechanism in place to monitor the implementation of the BLMAs. Furthermore, pre-externalization checks on the working conditions, safety and health perspectives of the importing labour organizations had not been undertaken. I observed that 246 female migrant workers returned between June and December 2019 without completing their contract period of two years due to human abuse related challenges, according to the Uganda Association of External Recruitment Agencies reception Centre report on Returnee Migrant workers.\\n\\nFurthermore, 548 external labour cases were registered, out of which, 48 (9%) cases remained unresolved at year end.\\n\\nAccordingly, the gender equality, labour and human rights of over 103,935 Ugandan workers who have migrated to various countries to provide labour, from July 2016 to June 2021, may not be guaranteed without duly signed BLMAs.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the finalization of bilateral migrant agreements with all the destination countries as this would provide clear international protocols for protection of migrant workers. In addition, the Ministry should liaise with Ugandan Missions in the destination countries and register all the Ugandan migrants for ease of follow up.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.8.2.  \\nImplementation of the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme\\n\\nThe Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) is an initiative of the Government for empowering women to improve their income levels and their contribution to economic development; by improving their access to financial services and equipping them with skills for enterprise growth, value addition and marketing of their products and services. The Programme has disbursed UGX.107 billion to 11,256 women groups, covering approximately 135,000 women, over the five-year period from financial year 2015/16 to 2019/20.\\n\\nI carried out a Value for Money audit to assess the extent to which the Programme achieved its intended objectives, and noted a number of key improvement areas as follows;\\n\\ni)  \\nI noted that only 4,185 women had benefited from the Programme under the capacity and skills development component, which translates into 42% of the desired target (10,000 women) according to the UWEP Programme document.\\n\\nii)  \\nThere were delays in disbursement of funds to the women groups. In some cases, the delays were more than 12 months from time of approval of the applications to receipt of the funds which affected the performance and success of enterprises, specifically those in the agricultural sector, which depend on the rainy seasons for planting.\\n\\niii)  \\nDespite the UGX.16Bn sitting on the recovery account with Bank of Uganda from the loan repayments over the five years, only UGX.963 million (6%) of the amount had been revolved. This denied the qualifying women groups timely access to funds, which were otherwise available for disbursement.\\n\\niv) The Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development through the UWEP Technical Support Unit did not effectively plan and coordinate implementation of the objectives of facilitating women to access markets for their product, as well as promoting access to appropriate technologies which were not allocated funds in the budgets for the entire 5-year period. Consequently, these objectives were not fully achieved.\\n\\nv) There was underfunding of monitoring and supervision activities at the local government level which affected the frequency of monitoring of beneficiary women groups. The programme gaps at enterprise level could not be adequately identified and corrected on time. At the National level, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) undertook only 13 (43%) of the planned 30 monitoring and supervision visits to the regions throughout the five-year period. This resulted in delayed identification of performance gaps and timely remedial actions.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer, prioritize the capacity and skills development component of the Programme and ensure women groups are given funds after attaining the requisite skills in management of the approved enterprises. In addition, the Ministry and Local Authorities should iron out all the bottlenecks in the application approval process to ensure timely revolving of the funds to women groups.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.9. LAND SECTOR  \\n3.9.1. Management of Government Land Matters\\n\\nThe Uganda Land Commission is mandated to manage public land acquired by government both abroad and locally. I noted that the Commission does not have an inventory for all government land and properties that are either occupied by tenants, vacant, acquired under compensation (but not yet re-distributed to the bona fide occupants), or acquired and owned by other government institutions and missions abroad. This inadequacy has contributed to government losing land to fraudsters, squatters and also inadequate revenue collections from the untimely collection of the property premiums and leases.\\n\\nI further noted an increase of UGX. 118.Bn (81.5%) in land compensation payables during the year, of which UGX 105.5Bn related to new compensations for land, while UGX.12.5Bn related to revaluations of land that had been previously fully compensated or had an outstanding payment. Furthermore, UGX.8.93Bn (15%) was paid to eight (8) persons out of the eight four (84) ranchers who had not been paid in the previous years. The delay to pay other ranch claimants may result into litigation and court awards that would further increase the domestic arrears. As at 30th June, 2021, the outstanding claim from ranchers was UGX.61.5Bn, and compensations to other claimants stood at UGX.188.0Bn, thus bringing total outstanding compensations in the Ministry of Lands alone to UGX.249.5Bn.  \\nSimilarly, the current landlord claims under the Uganda Land Fund, at the Uganda Land Commission, stand at UGX 194.7Bn. These also increased by UGX.7.2Bn during the current year. However, this amount is not supported by complete and appropriate documentation. The claims have been outstanding for a while due to the limited budget allocation to the Commission and the delay to fully operationalize the Land Fund which has remained operating as a budget support line in the Commission’s appropriated budget.\\n\\nI advised government to fully operationalize the Land Fund under the Commission and consider decentralizing all government land compensation payment claims to the Fund for proper management of government compensation processes, including mobilization of funds.\\n\\n3.10. EDUCATION SECTOR  \\n3.10.1. Management of Bilateral Scholarships\\n\\nSection 42(1) of the Higher Education Students Financing Act provides that all scholarships offered by the Government of Uganda (GOU), including bilateral scholarships, existing immediately before the commencement of this Act shall vest in the Board.\\n\\nSubsection (2) further provides that the central scholarship committee of the Ministry of education and Sports existing immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to exist on such a date as the Minister may by Statutory Instrument publish in the gazette.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOver the years, Uganda has received scholarships through various schemes from several Countries. The various types of awards include offers through bilateral cooperation, offers through multilateral cooperation and direct offers to individuals through Embassies of awarding Governments, Institutions and Agencies.\\n\\nScholarships awarded to Ugandans through Embassies of awarding Government are in most cases received on an annual basis, most of them routed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The major and regular donors are; United Kingdom, India, Egypt, China, Cuba, Turkey, Algeria, New Zealand and Hungary, among others.\\n\\nA review was undertaken with the objective of establishing the effectiveness in management of Bi-lateral scholarships, identifying the challenges and providing recommendations for improvement. During the analysis, a number of aspects were considered including; the extent of awareness of the scholarship programmes by Ugandans, absorption of Bilateral Scholarships, and the transparency and effectiveness of the award process. The following matters anomalies were identified;\\n\\n- Management of scholarships at the Ministry of Education and Sports is not supported by a Scholarship Policy, thus the country lacks policy direction in regard to sourcing, accepting, allocation and monitoring of scholarships.\\n\\n- The Ministry of Education and Sports still holds the mandate of managing Government scholarships contrary to Section 42(1) of the Higher Education Students Financing Act which revoked the Committee’s mandate.\\n\\n- Information on Scholarship offered at the different Missions and other Government organizations was not readily available at the Secretariat.\\n\\n- Low uptake of scholarships was noted whereby out of a total of 280 scholarships offered to government in the previous three years, only 162 were filled resulting into an under absorption of 118 (42%) scholarships.\\n\\nThe above outlined weaknesses have resulted into the process of accessing information on scholarships not being properly streamlined and consequently leading to low utilization/absorption of the scholarships available to the Country.\\n\\nI advised the Ministry of Education and Sports to ensure that the administration of scholarships in the country is streamlined for efficient and effective management.\\n\\n3.10.2. Management of Research Grants by Public Universities in Uganda\\n\\nOwing to the different challenges faced by public Universities in the management of research grants I undertook a value for money audit and independently assessed the management of research grants by Public Universities in 4 out of the 9 Public Universities in Uganda, these included; Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), Kyambogo University and Busitema University. I noted the following;\\n\\ni)  \\nThere is no framework to ensure collective planning, coordination and follow-up of research efforts for the different Public Universities to ensure equitable allocation of resources, efficient utilization of academic staff, and that research results contribute to National development.\\n\\n---\\n\\nii)  \\nI noted that key research and grant management policies/guidelines were missing at a number of Universities to guide on the efficient and effective management of research activities. Furthermore, the country lacks national regulations and guidelines for research and innovation activities including; sourcing of external grants, development and uptake of technologies and, management and commercialization of intellectual properties.\\n\\niii)  \\nI noted inadequate administration structures for management of university grants, for example, out of the 4 Universities, only MUST had a grants office with dedicated staff to support grant activities. Busitema and Kyambogo universities did not have grants administrators at college/faculty level, while at Makerere and Mbarara only the college of Health Sciences and the faculty of medicine, respectively, had grant administrators to undertake the tasks.\\n\\niv)  \\nI noted that the country does not have a clear research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy matters regarding research in the Country. Some Universities lacked research agenda. For example, Mbarara and Busitema Universities did not have an approved research agenda.\\n\\nv) I noted that resource mobilization initiatives for public universities were inadequate. Out of the 4 universities, only MUK had a consolidated Research Innovation Fund (RIF) for research funds from government the other universities have not explored this initiative. All the universities have not raised any resources internally into a separate fund for research. This was attributed to government policy of remitting all internally generated revenue into the consolidated fund.\\n\\nvi)  \\nI noted monitoring and evaluation of research projects was inadequate in all the four Universities. M&E was not carried out by the university management on external research grants for the period 2017/18-2019/20. I further noted that even where M&E was undertaken by donors, recommendations were not fully implemented by the Universities.\\n\\nvii) I noted significant delays in completion of research projects. For example, 450 (88%) out of 512 Government funded Grants from MUK, Kyambogo and Busitema, were not completed in time during the period under review. Similarly, 218 (62.3%) out of 350 Donor funded Grants from the 4 universities were not completed in time.\\n\\nI advised government through its various entities to consider establishing a National research agenda which should be supported by a comprehensive research management framework streamlined throughout the entities. In addition, Government should consider establishing a research fund at each public university in which both government and donor research funds could be collected and effectively managed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.11. WATER & ENVIRONMENT SECTOR\\n\\n3.11.1.  \\nAfforestation and Restoration of Selected Central Forest Reserves (CFRS) by the National Forest Authority (NFA)\\n\\nThe National Forestry Authority (NFA) was established under section 52 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 (NFTPA) with an objective of managing the Central Forest reserves. The country’s forest cover reduced from 24% (4,933,271ha) in 1990 to 9% (1,956,664ha) in 2015, with a slight increase of up to 12.3% (2,025,192ha) in 2017. The forest cover loss over the years from 1990 to the last biomass study in 2017 was estimated at 58.9%. Similarly, the CFR forest cover under NFA’s jurisdiction alone dropped from 62.5% (791,240ha) of the NFA forest cover to 45.8% (579,257ha) in the same period. This trend was contrary to Sustainable Development Goal 15 which required governments to ensure the restoration of forests and increase forest cover in line with obligations under international agreements by 2020.\\n\\nI carried a value for money audit to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place by the NFA towards the restoration and establishment of new plantations in the central forest reserves, between the period of 2016 and 2020, and noted the following;\\n\\ni) Although management achieved 11,173ha (78%) of their planned outputs (14,277ha) for both restoration planting and establishment of new tree plantations, this only contributed a total of only 0.88% to the NFA forest cover (1,265,742ha) over the four-year period. This dismal performance was attributed to a number of inadequacies in the Planning; Budgeting; Land management; Monitoring and Inspections; and Collaboration management, resulting into the failure by NFA to meet its desired targets towards increasing the national forest cover.\\n\\nii) A number of stakeholders in the forest sector, with different projects across MDAs supporting forestry restoration activities, were not adequately coordinated under a single mandate. In addition, there are; inconsistencies in the national, sector and NFA strategic plans, there is a lack of specific outputs per stakeholder in the plan together with matching funding for the activities met to achieve the planned outputs. These inadequacies in coordination and planning at NFA, the Forest sector and national level have contributed to the limited National forest coverage of 12.3% and NFA forest cover of 45.8%.\\n\\niii) I that out of the expected 16 monitoring reports in the four-year period ending 30 th June, 2020, only 4 (25%) were prepared in the entire four-year period. In addition, NFA budgeted to receive UGX.320m for monitoring in the four years under review, but only UGX.91.8million (29%) was released, and the entity spent UGX 88.8million over the period on monitoring activity. Furthermore, there were limitations in discussing and implementing monitoring report recommendations, and as a result, there were instances in which management did not demarcate the area as recommended by the M&E report before restoring the forest. This led to destruction of the newly restored forests by encroachers.\\n\\nI established that seventeen (17) MOUs were signed with different government agencies, out of the planned twenty (20), representing an 85% performance. Although these collaborations contributed to the restoration and establishment of new plantations, there were inadequacies in providing the planned quantity of seedlings. In addition, twenty (20) out twenty-eight (28) Collaborative Forest management (CFM) agreements were signed with forest edge communities.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to improve on the Planning, Budgeting, Coordination and Collaborations, Monitoring aspects, and prioritization of fixed resources required in the restoration and establishment of forest cover in the country.\\n\\n3.12. WORKS SECTOR\\n\\n3.12.1.  \\nUganda National Roads Authority\\n\\na)  \\nLoss of funds in interest on delayed payment of contractors\\n\\nThe Authority incurred wasteful expenditure to a tune of UGX.17Bn in form of interest and penalties due to delayed settlement of invoices from contractors. This was a loss to Government. The Accounting Officer explained that interest costs arise due to inadequate funding for the road development and maintenance projects that UNRA is managing. I advised the Accounting Officer to enhance the Authority cash flow management by rationalizing available resources, especially reduction of advances payments to settle outstanding claims and to improve the Authority’s budgeting process and liaison with relevant authorities such Parliament and Ministry of Finance for adequate financial resource allocation.\\n\\nb)  \\nDelayed road projects and accumulation of commitment fees\\n\\nBy 30 th June 2021, 35 road projects under UNRA with a total contract value of USD.398,427,063.99 and UGX.149,739,813,845 had been delayed. These 35 projects were to be completed during the year were behind schedule as per their work programme still on-going by the close of the year. The delays which ranged from 64 days (about two months) to 1,072 days (about two months three years) days were majorly attributed to: inadequate mobilization by some contractors, abnormal rains, delayed acquisition of Right of Way and the effects of COVID-19 that resulted into nationwide lockdown. I computed commitment fees on only two projects (Busega-Mpigi- UGX.7,1140,345,245) and RSSPV (UGX.3,079,241,588) and observed an accumulation of total commitment fees amounting to UGX.10,219,586,833 in only one year alone.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the delay to complete the projects was due to a number of factors that included; inadequate mobilization by some contractors, abnormal rains, delayed acquisition of Right of Way and the effects of COVID-19 that resulted into nationwide lockdown. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that projects are completed within the agreed timelines.\\n\\nc)  \\nDelayed compensation for Project Affected Persons and Acquisition of Right of Way for Road Projects (Projects- Kampala Jinja Expressway, Hoima Wanseko)\\n\\nI observed delays in compensation of Project Affected Persons and hence Acquisition of the Right of Way. The majority of Project Affected Persons are compensated beyond the stipulated six-month period after approval of the Valuation Reports by the Chief Government Valuer. For the KJE Project, the construction works are planned to commence in January 2022. However, 21% of the approved compensation amount worth UGX.92,571,144,970 has not yet been paid, with less than 6 months to the scheduled commencement date which is likely to impede timely handover of the project corridor and timely commencement of works. In addition, compensation for properties within volume 5 comprising Kasokoso area had not yet been assessed.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that a number of issues caused the delays for compensations, such as; lack of proper ownership documents, for example; sales agreements, letters of administration, ownership disputes especially for untitled interests like Kibanja or customary land, absentee landlords, and; rejection of compensation awards by PAPs that lead to review of the complaint to ascertain validity. I advised the Accounting Officer to consider using escrow accounts with district local governments for the absentee landlords and PAPs where funds may be deposited so as to aid fast land acquisition.\\n\\n3.12.2.  \\nMinistry of Works and Transport\\n\\na) Failure to maintain district road equipment\\n\\nThe inspection of the Ministry’s Regional Mechanical Workshops during August and September 2021 revealed that 21 units of district road equipment which are key in opening and maintaining district roads were left unused in the workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair. The equipment included: thirteen (13) motor graders of different models; four (4) bulldozers; One (1) pickup; two (2) dump trucks, and one (1) wheel loader. This means that the districts that own the said equipment could not maintain their roads and deliver such critical service to the country as planned. In addition, the cost of repair may escalate as other parts also become faulty when the equipment is grounded for a long time.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the amount budgeted and received to maintain road equipment represents 30% of the total funds required for equipment maintenance. I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the responsible authorities to obtain the necessary funding for the full maintenance of the equipment so that the equipment operates and serves the Districts.\\n\\nb) Delayed acquisition of land for the Right of Way for the Standard Gauge Railway project (Ministry of Works and Transport)\\n\\nThe SGR project was to acquire 5,200 acres of land free of encumbrances at an estimated cost of UGX 534.6 bn for the Right of Way (ROW) for the construction of the Kampala – Malaba SGR route by October 2016. However, by September 2021 only 1,296 acres (25%) had been acquired at a cost of UGX 95.3 bn. Additionally, the project had not obtained titles for the acquired land. There are risks of subsequent compensation for the land already paid for and failure to acquire all the land needed for the full realization of the project.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that currently, land acquisition is one of the core activities of the project. He further explained that the releases however have been going down in comparison to the annual budgets. I advised the Accounting Officer to obtain and transfer land titles to Government for the land paid for and expedite the acquisition of all the land needed for the project.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.12.3. Uganda Railways Corporation\\n\\na) Procurement, supply, delivery, training and commissioning of four (4) used locomotives\\n\\nURC contracted M/S GRP Leasing Africa for the supply, delivery, training and commissioning of four (4) used locomotives under procurement reference; URC/SUPLS/2020-11/0001 at UGX.41,323,768,935. However, I noted that the bidder did not comply with some requirements within the bid document which were supposed to be the basis of evaluation. Despite the non-compliance, the bid was evaluated without following the evaluation criteria for Technical stage contrary to the regulations. Non-compliance with the evaluation criteria may have led to delivery of unsuitable locomotives at an inflated cost. Important to note was that the locomotives could not turn at the existing turning points in the country. Therefore, the Corporation will incur un-planned costs of providing turning points for the locomotives.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer further explained that the limiting turning curvature for the 98 class locomotives is 26 degrees whereas the existing railway triangle had some sections with sharper curvature of less than 26 degrees presumably because the existing triangle design considered the existing locomotive fleet prior to purchase of the new locomotives with different design specifications to safely change direction at the triangle. The physical constraints of the triangle including 2 bridges over Nakivubo channel, high voltage electricity transmission line pylon and the Kampala Flyover Project Right of Way have limited any possible improvements in the triangle alignment to relax the limiting curvature. I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that Evaluation Committees check for bids’ responsiveness to the criteria set in the bid documents and recommend only fully responsive bids for award of contracts.\\n\\nb) Lack of Land titles - UGX 91,832,636,500\\n\\nI noted that Uganda Railways Corporation land worth UGX.91,832,636,500 lacked land titles as evidence of URC’s rights to own and use the property. Management’s efforts to secure the land titles appear remote. Lack of land titles led to the Corporation’s land to have been heavily encroached upon and grabbed as was observed during field inspection.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that Management was pursuing the titling of land in various locations. I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the completion of Management interventions and processing of titles for all URC land.\\n\\n3.12.4.  \\nUganda Civil Aviation Authority\\n\\na) Delayed revision of the Financing Agreement for the Exim Bank loan for Upgrading and Expansion of the Entebbe International Airport (EIA) Phase I Project\\n\\nUCAA entered into an agreement with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) on 8 th October 2014 for the upgrading and expansion of the EIA Phase I. To obtain funding for this project, the Government of Uganda (GoU) represented by Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) entered into a 20 years’ concessional loan agreement not exceeding Japanese Yuan One Billion, two hundred and sixty million (¥ 1,260,000,000), equivalent to USD Two Hundred Million ($200,000,000) with the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China on 31 st March 2015.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSubsequently, MoFPED entered into an on-lending agreement with the UCAA which transferred the following loan obligations to the Authority: -\\n\\na) Semi-annual loan repayment within 13 years after the grace period of 7 years at an interest rate of 2% p.a on the principal amount drawn for the actual number of days elapsed from a 360-day year.\\n\\nb)  \\nPayment of a management fee on the aggregate amount of the facility equal to ¥ 3,150,000 (USD 500,000) in one lump sum within 30 days after the effective date of the agreement with EXIM Bank but not later than the first disbursement.\\n\\nc) Semi-annual payment of commitment fees calculated at 0.25% per annum during the loan availability period.\\n\\nOther terms of the agreements relating to the loan included:  \\na) The Repayment Reserve account shall be used to maintain the minimum amount of balance as a debt service reserve required by the lender.\\n\\nb) Banking of Revenue collections on Escrow Accounts, and ensuring that withdrawals are based on approvals of the lender.\\n\\nc)  \\nBudgeting and Approval of Annual budgets by the lender for funds on Escrow Accounts.\\n\\nd)  \\nPaying semi-annually to the lender a commitment fee calculated at the rate set forth in concessional loan agreement (which is 0.25%) on the undrawn and un-cancelled balance of the facility.\\n\\nBecause UCAA was not prepared to meet the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, several meetings were held with the MoFPED and the MoWT and a resolution was made to have a Ugandan team headed by Uganda’s Ambassador to China, to engage Exim bank for a renegotiation of the loan terms and conditions. At the time, the Exim Bank had halted payments to the Contractor.\\n\\nThe Accounting officer explained that as per the Attorney Generals guidance dated 5th November 2021, in his opinion none of the clauses in the agreement require amendment.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage the relevant authorities on the clarity of the consequences of non-compliance with the terms and conditions that directly affect UCAA’s operations, and on the possibility of transferring the loan liability from UCAA’s books to MoFPED.\\n\\nb) Ratio analysis and financial performance of Uganda Civil Aviation Authority  \\nThe Authority made a loss for the year under review amounting to UGX 29,321,645,000. On review of the operating margin, I observed that the costs before considering interest and taxes exceeded revenue for the year. I also observed that due to the loss incurred, the Authority generated a negative return on assets of 5%. Further, the Authority could not cover interest accrued on its long-term loans in view of its earnings. Along with the lack of potential to cover loan interest, the Authority had a significant long term liabilities portfolio on its balance sheet, which majorly comprised of the loan from Exim of China to finance the upgrading and expansion of Entebbe International Airport.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Authority’s loss and the ratios computed are an indication that Uganda Civil Aviation Authority did not perform well in terms of profitability and ability to sustain provision of services without further Government intervention for funding and Management strategies to improve revenue generation. The Accounting Officer explained that the performance results during the period were severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation that affected the airport operations of the Authority.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting officer to ensure that strategies are devised to improve the revenue generating potential of the Authority, while putting in place cost cutting mechanisms. I also advised the Accounting Officer to engage Government on further financing including clearance of the debt held by Government agencies, to be able to cover the current operating costs as they devise strategies to improve the earning potential of the Authority.\\n\\n3.13. HEALTH SECTOR\\n\\n3.13.1.  \\nMulago National Referral Hospital\\n\\na)  \\nStatus of key medical equipment\\n\\nI carried out an assessment of key medical equipment in the hospital. The assessment focused on the functionality and availability of medical equipment in seven key hospital departments, that is; CSSD, radiology, nuclear medicine, ICU, Laundry, clinical laboratories and accidents and emergencies. I noted that some vital medical equipment was in poor working condition, while others were fully not functional and required replacement. The equipment included: autoclaves in the central sterile service department; patient monitors in the accident and emergency surgical unit; blood coagulation machine in the clinical laboratory unit; ICU beds in the intensive care unit, and CT machine in the Radiology department.\\n\\nManagement attributed the poor state of medical equipment in the Hospital to the limited funding provided under the capital development budget of the Hospitals. Absence of such essential medical equipment presents a daunting task for the medical workers in the effective execution of their duties. The efficiency of the medical workers is compromised.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the MoFPED and development partners to ensure that the funding gaps are covered to have the essential medical equipment provided to the hospital units.\\n\\nb)  \\nDelayed Construction of 150 housing units\\n\\nI observed delays in the construction 150 housing units at Mulago Hospital. The contract was awarded on 20 th June 2020 at UGX.30,228,600,856 for a duration of thirty-six (36) months. One year and half down the road, the contractor had not yet completed the foundation of the first block out of the three blocks expected.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer indicated that the UGX. 4bn cap on the hospital capital expenditure budget creates challenges in undertaking high value capital projects since the absence of funding leads to delays in achievement of project milestones leading to project cost overruns. The Accounting Officer further explained that they have received funds in this Financial Year Budget to pay the contractor and it is expected that by the end of June 2022, the progress of construction shall be at a desirable level.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with contractor to ensure that the construction of the above staff houses is expedited.\\n\\n3.13.2. National Drug Authority  \\na) Delayed Construction of the Laboratory Tower\\n\\nNDA is undertaking a Laboratory Tower Construction project at a total contract sum of UGX. 35,849,057,474. The start for the works was 11 th October 2019 and the original completion date was 11 th October 2021. The completion was revised to 07 th March 2022 because of delays. By the time of inspection, UGX 11,847,043,442 had been paid to the contractors. The implementation of the contract was not sufficiently managed leading to delayed works.\\n\\nI also noted that changes were made to the original building plans to cater for the adjustments to the outdoor and building basement parking and though the Contract Management Team and the Authority (NDA) had approved the adjustments and works had commenced by the time of audit in August 2021, the amended building plans had not yet been approved by the Metropolitan Physical Planning Authority. Implementation of unapproved building plans poses a risk of loss of the NDA funds in case the responsible Authority (Metropolitan Authority /KCCA) rejects the plans and directs demolition of the works.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the delays in the completion of works were due to the COVID-19 lockdown that took two phases in 2020 and 2021 which interrupted staff movement, manufacturing of inputs globally and transportation. The Accounting Officer also explained that the consultant submitted the revised drawings on 3rd August 2020 and no response had come through despite numerous follow-ups including that of 15th April 2021. Management promised to continue reminding KCCA to approve the submitted adjusted plans.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the contractors to scale up project works to ensure that the project is completed within reasonable timelines. I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the Physical Planning Authority/KCCA to ensure that the building plans are approved as soon as possible.\\n\\n3.14. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION SECTOR\\n\\n3.14.1.  \\nClosure of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation\\n\\nThe GoU established the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation in 2016, and it started its operations in 2017/2018 as Vote 023, with a mandate to oversee the overall contribution of the Science Technology and Innovation Sector towards attaining key objectives focused on mainstreaming Science, Technology, and Innovation in the development process of Uganda.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt the time of the transfer, the Ministry had the following subventions and independent projects in pursuit of its objectives;\\n\\ni)  \\nUganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST);  \\nii)  \\nThe Presidential Initiative on Banana Industrial Development (PIBID); and  \\niii) Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC).  \\niv)  \\nUganda Industrial Research Institute (Vote 110), an agency under the ST&I Sector and self-accounting.  \\nv)  \\nThe commercialisation of sericulture Technologies and Innovations(TRIDI)  \\nvi) Presidential Scientific initiative on Epidemics (PRESIDE) is an umbrella organisation for multiple scientific research organisations.\\n\\nThe Ministry was later abolished effective 1st July 2021, and its operations were transferred to the President\\'s Office. The Ministry\\'s closure may slow down the developments in the above entities during re-organisation.\\n\\nI noted that there were also no transition plans for the merger and continuity of operations of the subventions. Lack of transition arrangements could delay research projects, loss of assets and critical human resources.\\n\\n3.14.2.  \\nUn-deployed Staff upon the abolition of the Ministry\\n\\nThe Ministry had a structure with a total staff establishment of 154 positions, of which 136 positions had been filled and had a recruitment plan for another fifteen (15) staff of different cadres.\\n\\nAs a result of the closure of the Ministry, the staff were rendered redundant and had not received their emoluments by the end of November 2021. In addition, 48 common cadre staff had been transferred back to the Ministry of Public Service, as the technical and support staff employed by the Ministry await their fate.\\n\\nI noted that some staff were living under uncertainty, which may lead to redundancy escalation and high costs to the Government.\\n\\nManagement explained that the Ministry of Public Service is reviewing the structure, and once it is approved, a validation exercise will be undertaken to determine those who fit in. Those that will not be absorbed will be handled in line with the public service standing orders.\\n\\n3.14.3.  \\nProgress on the COVID-19 Vaccine, Diagnostics and Treatment Projects\\n\\nThe Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) was appropriated supplementary funding of UGX.31.033Bn, which was meant to support 23 selected projects of scientists and innovators engaged in CoVID-I9 scientific research, including the procurement of specialised machinery and equipment, development of vaccines, drug diagnostics and other operational costs. The funds were divided into the purchase of Equipment (UGX.15.787Bn) and Operational Costs (UGX.15.787Bn).\\n\\nAs of 30th June 2021, the Ministry had received 86.5% of the Operational funds and 100% of the Equipment Funds.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOf the 23 projects, five were for Diagnostics, four for the development of Vaccines, nine for the development of treatments, and five for material support to existing projects.  \\nOf the 23 projects initially selected and funded, 19 progressed while others stalled. Their progress was slowed down by the merger of the Ministry without transition plans and subsequent delays in funding.\\n\\nThese delays affect the overall intention of the emergency initiative of averting the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the population.\\n\\n3.15. TRADE SECTOR\\n\\n3.15.1.  \\nUnder Absorption of funds by UDC\\n\\nUDC received UGX 263.47Bn, from the Government of Uganda, of which only UGX 119.29Bn, (45.3%), was spent by the entity during the year resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 144.18Bn, (46%)\\n\\nOut of the total funds received, UGX.126.2Bn was for Covid-19related interventions, and only UGX.55.9Bn (44.3%) was spent.\\n\\nThis may be partly attributed to the release of funds before completion of feasibility studies, the release of funds tagged to specific projects in disregard of UDC project appraisals and the un-timely release of funds, among others.\\n\\nUnder-absorption undermines the intention of Government funding for import substitution and export promotion strategies spearheaded by the Corporation and averting the effects of Covid-19.\\n\\n3.15.2.  \\nExtent of Implementation of Planned Development Projects by UDC:\\n\\nI noted that out of the 17 development project activities planned to be implemented over the year, 15 were funded under the Covid-19 supplementary budget. Two development projects, namely: Soroti Fruit Factory and Feasibility studies & Business Plans, were funded under the normal budget.\\n\\nA review of the extent of implementation revealed that;\\n\\n- Only (3) three development projects were fully implemented, i.e., shareholder\\'s loan to Atiak Sugar Factory; Acquisition of shares in Mabale Tea Factory; and Acquisition of shares in Bukoona Agro Processors Limited.\\n- Five (5) development projects were partially implemented.\\n- Eleven (11) projects were not implemented at all.\\n\\nThis was attributed to the conditional release of funds tied to specified development projects and inadequate institutional capacity to appraise and implement investment projects.\\n\\nUnder-absorption undermines government effort in attaining its goals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.15.3.  \\nUNBS Inadequate Capacity in Testing and Enforcing Commodity Standards\\n\\nSection 3(1) of the UNBS Act spells out the functions of the Bureau which, among others, include providing for the testing of locally manufactured or imported commodities with a view to determining whether the commodities conform to the standard specification as well as making arrangements or provide facilities for the examination, testing or analysis of commodities and any material or substance from which or with which and how they may be manufactured, produced, processed or treated. However, I noted;\\n\\n- UNBS released 633 consignments due to the absence of standards to test these commodities for conformity.\\n\\n- The Bureau also released 366 consignments without testing product standards due to lack of capacity, which may lead to sub-standard products on the market.\\n\\n- The Bureau had staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. This was attributed to understaffing at the Bureau.\\n\\nAlthough management explained that it had since developed the capacity to test the majority of commodities but it lacked some product standards.\\n\\n3.16. TOURISM SECTOR\\n\\n3.16.1.  \\nDecreasing Tourism Revenue due to Covid-19\\n\\nOver the last two years, the tourism sector has been greatly hit by the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that has greatly affected all sectors of the economy, including the tourism sector.\\n\\nI observed a significant fall in tourism revenue collections for all of the entities in the Sector whose revenue is entirely dependent on tourism. This was attributed to the countrywide restrictions on the movement of persons, including tourists, due to the Covid-19 lockdown. As a result, tourist visitor numbers reduced from 255,711 to 103,812 (40.6%)\\n\\nThe reduction in revenue collection has been significant and has directly affected the implementation of the planned activities across the Sector.\\n\\n3.16.2.  \\nInvasive species removal in the Wildlife Conservation Areas in Uganda\\n\\nI noted that most of the Protected Areas in Uganda are currently undergoing ecosystem changes as rangeland infestation by invasive and exotic plant species limits the grazing land. These plant species include; Dichrostachys cinerea, Lantana camara, Parthenium hysterophorus, Opuntia vulgaris, Imperata cylindrica, Maeruade cumbens, Caesalepina decaputala, Acacia hockii, Tecoma Stan, Senna siamea and Thevetia peruviana.\\n\\n---\\n\\nDuring my inspection of Queen Elizabeth, Lake Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks, I noted that these plant species continue to cover large expanses of grazing land despite the Uganda Wildlife Authority\\'s effort to eliminate them. This is reducing the populations of specific grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda kobs.\\n\\nThis is attributed to climate change and inadequate funding to remove invasive species from the national parks.\\n\\n3.16.3.  \\nMerger of entities within the Sector\\n\\nOn 22nd February 2021, Cabinet under minute No. 43 (CT 2021), a decision to merge Uganda Wildlife Authority with Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre was undertaken. However, there were no transitional arrangements and plans to facilitate a smooth merger by the time of the audit.\\n\\nDelays in mergers create uncertainties among staff, reduce sector performance and subsequently lead to misappropriation of entity assets by disgruntled staff.\\n\\n3.17.  \\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE AUDIT OF LOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE PERIOD 2019/2020\\n\\nI undertook an audit of a total of 2,048 Lower Local Governments (Sub-counties, Town Councils and Divisions), covering two financial years 2018/2019 (762 LLGs) and 2019/2020 (1,286 LLGs).  \\nI noted the following cross cutting issues;\\n\\n3.17.1. Under staffing\\n\\nI noted that 217 LLGs in FY 2018/2019 and 175 in FY 2019/2020 had significant staffing gaps averaging 48% and 60% shortages respectively. Details are in the table 26 below.\\n\\nTable 26: Understaffing in Lower Local Government\\n\\n| Financial Year | Approved | Filled up | Shortage | Percentage shortage |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| positions |<|<|<|  \\n| 2018/2019 | 3,847 | 2,008 | 1,842 | 48% |  \\n| 2019/2020 6,797 2,713 3,823 60% |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nSource: OAG analysis\\n\\nUnderstaffing overstretches the available staff beyond their capacity, creates jobrelated stress to the fewer staff and negatively affects the level of public service delivery to the community.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that staffing at LLG level is a responsibility of the respective Districts and Municipal Councils.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to follow up on the matter with the relevant authorities and ensure that most of the vacancies are filled.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.17.2.  \\nBudget implementation in sample LLGs for FY 2018/2019 and 2019/2020\\n\\nI sampled 627 LLGs for FY 2018/19 and 250 LLGs for FY 2019/20 to assess the implementation of the budget and noted the following significant audit findings:\\n\\n3.17.2.1. Performance of Central Government Grants\\n\\nThe LLGs sampled budgeted to receive UGX.146,160,919,043 for FY 2018/2019 and 2019/2010 (revised) as Central Government Grants). However, UGX.134,095,135,622(92%) was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.12,065,783,421(8%) majorly attributed to budget cuts as shown in the table below.\\n\\nThis affected service delivery in Lower Local Governments Table 27: Performance of Central Government Grant\\n\\n| Financial Year | Revised Budget | Actual Receipts | Variance | Percentage |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n||<|<|<| Perfomance |  \\n| 2018/2019 | 92,214,094,491 | 87,717,635,886 | 4,496,458,605 | 95% |  \\n| 2019/2020 53,946,824,552 46,377,499,736 7,569,324,816 86% |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nSource: Financial Statements\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always engage the PS/ST through their respective higher local governments to ensure that all revenue is availed to the entity as planned.\\n\\n3.17.2.2. Local Revenue Performance\\n\\nThe LLGs sampled had approved budgeted total local revenue for the 2 financial years amounting to UGX.91,399,324,016 (revised) out of which UGX.74,615,525,633(82%) was collected resulting into a shortfall of UGX.16,783,798,383(18%), as shown in the table below:\\n\\nTable 28: Performance of Local Revenue\\n\\n| Financial Year | Revised Budget | Actual Receipts | Variance | Percentage |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 2018/2019 68,424,052,397 57,321,631,217 11,102,421,180 |<|<|<| Perfomance |  \\n|^|<|<|<| 84% |  \\n| 2019/2020 22,975,271,619 17,293,894,416 5,681,377,203 75% |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nSource: OAG analysis\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers mainly attributed the underperformance of local revenue in the financial year 2019/2020 to the Covid19 lock down which affected several of their major sources of local revenue.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that local revenue is collected as budgeted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.17.3.  \\nQuality of Financial Statements\\n\\nIn my previous year’s reports, I noted that there was still a problem with the presentation of financial statements in the Lower Local Governments. In the financial years under review, I noted that there was an improvement in the quality of financial statements with only 37 (6%) LLGs out of 627 and 22 (9%) out of 250 LLGs in financial years 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 respectively having qualified audit opinions.\\n\\nI however noted the following matters; UGX 202, 282,811 was improperly accounted for in FY 2018/2019 and UGX 80,259,257 remained Un accounted for in FY 2019/2020.\\n\\nThe most common shortcomings were; Inconsistences in the amounts in the financial statement, Errors in Financial Statements, Incomplete financial statements and notes, wrong presentation of figures in financial statement, failure to prepare financial statements and unsupported figures in the financial statements.\\n\\nPreparation of financial statements is a stewardship role in which accountability for application of resources entrusted to Accounting Officers is reported to the stakeholders. Failure to present financial statements properly impairs interpretation and analysis of entity performances.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to staff changes that were made in the middle of the financial year, difficulty in acquiring books of accounts from district stores and lack of training. I advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with responsible authorities to ensure that the staffing gaps are addressed and the necessary trainings undertaken.\\n\\n3.17.4.  \\nLand Management in Local Governments\\n\\nI noted that 331 (53%) Lower Local Governments out of the 627 in FY 2018/19 and 188 (75%) Lower Local Governments out of 250 in FY 2019/20 sampled respectively had land management challenges such as:\\n\\n- 41 LLGs in FY 2018/19 and 24 LLGs in FY 2019/20 respectively lacked land titles, including where their headquarters are located.\\n- 41 LLGs in FY 2018/19 and 24 LLGs in FY 2019/20 respectively lacked Area Lands Committees or the committees were non-functional.\\n- In the circumstances, there is risk of persons trespassing, disputes and litigation.\\n\\nMajority of Accounting Officers explained that it was the responsibility of the Districts or Municipal Councils to obtain these land titles. A number of other Accounting Officers cited insufficient funding as a cause for failure to have fully functional land committees\\n\\nGovernment should consider taking deliberate steps to fund the survey and titling of all government land at the Local Governments. I also advised the Accounting Officers to constitute the Area land Committees.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.17.5.  \\nLack of Urban Physical Planning Committees\\n\\nI noted that 32 Town Councils in the two financial years had no Urban Physical Planning Committees in place or the Committees were not fully functional.\\n\\nConsequently, physical developments undertaken within the physical planning areas may not have been well determined and managed by the respective LLGs. This was mainly attributed to lack of sufficient funds to operationalize the physical planning committees.\\n\\nI advised Government to engage the relevant stakeholders to nominate members and ensure that the committees are fully instituted and are functional.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPART 4: INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, VALUE FOR MONEY AND SPECIAL AUDITS\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2020/2021, I undertook three Information Systems audits, three Engineering audits covering 90 projects, eight Value for money audits. In addition, I undertook special and forensic audits which are reported on separately.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of the key findings I noted in each category, the details of which are included in individual reports issued separately.\\n\\n**4.0.**  \\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ENGINEERING AUDITS\\n\\n**4.1.** Value for Money Audit and Assessment of Urban Infrastructure projects implemented by 22 Municipal Councils under the USMID-AF Program for projects started in the Financial year 2018/2019\\n\\nFor the financial year 2020/21 a total of 14 infrastructure projects procured in 2018/2019 under the World Bank funded Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development-Additional Financing (USMID-AF) Program implemented by 22 Municipal Councils namely Arua, Gulu, Kitgum, Lira, Apac, Soroti, Moroto, Mbale, Tororo, Busia, Kamuli, Jinja, Lugazi, Entebbe, Hoima, Mubende, Fort Portal, Kasese, Mbarara, Ntungamo, Kabale and Masaka were audited and assessment of the performance of these projects across the 22 municipalities carried out including a selected sample of non-USMID i.e. Uganda Road Fund (URF) funded projects, and Schools Facilities Grant (SFG)/Transitional Development Grant (TDG)/Discretional Development Equalisation Grant (DDEG) funded projects implemented in the participating municipalities.\\n\\nThe total contract value of the projects assessed was UGX 192,742,021,942. Below is a summary of the Key findings I noted, the details of which are included in the consolidated audit report for the 22 Municipal Councils and the 22 Individual reports issued separately;\\n\\n- Overpayments and irregular expenditure on USMID and Non USMID projects were noted during the audit. This comprised of overpayments of UGX. 214,862,488 and UGX 459,323,494 on USMID projects and Non-USMID projects respectively. The audit assessment also revealed various questionable expenditures, irregular payments, and potential financial losses attributable to different contractual irregularities totaling to UGX. 817,571,137 on the USMID funded projects in Arua, Jinja and Mbale Municipalities.\\n\\n- All the municipalities had completed their projects by the time of the audit and the entire infrastructure in the municipalities was in use with the exception of Entebbe whose project was phased. Although the projects were finally completed there were delays in completion of the projects within the stipulated contract timelines.\\n\\n- During physical inspection of the municipalities of Mbale, Moroto and Lira, major defects were noted such as missing draining/emptying pipe on the\\n\\n---\\n\\nsoaking tank (leads to poor drainage), Clogged manholes and missing manhole covers, potholes on roads and poor drainage leading to ponding.\\n\\n- All the participating municipalities implemented environmental protection measures with the exception of Arua Municipality. Further, all the participating municipalities implemented social/safety measures except Soroti and Tororo Municipalities.\\n\\n- Inadequate allocation of funds in the budget for operation and maintenance of USMID infrastructure was noted in the municipalities except for the municipalities of Lira, Hoima, Fort Portal, Masaka and Gulu.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting officers of the Municipal Councils to ensure that;\\n\\n- All amounts overpaid are recovered by the respective municipalities.\\n- Contractors have updated work programs and delays in delivery of projects within stipulated contract timelines should be penalized by invoking liquidated damages clauses\\n- Inspections are carried out during the DLP as some defects can only surface while the structure is in use and report on the progress of the structure during the period and have all the identified major defects rectified.\\n- All municipalities should plan, budget and implement operation and maintenance activities to avoid early deterioration of the facilities.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOwing to the challenges faced by the Municipal Councils during the delivery of USMID- AF Urban infrastructure as highlighted in this report, audit observed that these challenges notable improvements have been noted in planning, cost control enforcement of internal controls for certification, supervision and monitoring, and general contract management for the USMID Infrastructure projects, however these gains have not been translated to the Non USMID projects as URF, SFG,DDEG accordingly the Town Clerks must ensure that Non USMID projects are equally effectively monitored and supervised to ensure delivery of the works within the planned cost, quality and time requirements\\n\\n**4.2.**  \\nValue for Money audit and assessment of Infrastructure projects implemented by 60 Local Governments under the UgIFT Program for Construction of Seed Schools and Health Facilities in the Education and Health Sectors\\n\\nFor the financial year 2020/21 a total of 109 infrastructure projects implemented by 60 Local Governments involving the construction of seed schools and Health centre IIs under the World Bank funded Uganda Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) Programme for Results was audited and assessment of the performance of these projects across the 60 Local Governments municipalities carried out for the Education Sector and Health Sector.\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnder the UgIFT programme, the World Bank committed the total of US$500m over the period FY 2018/19 to FY 2023/24 to support decentralized services in Education, Health, Water and Environment, and Agriculture (micro-scale irrigation) as well as support I  \\nnterventions in Refugee host communities, With this financial support, Government committed to construct Seed Secondary Schools and Upgrade Health Centre IIs to IIIs in Sub-Counties, extend rural water to underserved communities including the newly constructed seed Secondary Schools and Health Centre IIIs, and also provide Small Scale Irrigation equipment to farmers to enhance their productivity.\\n\\nThe scope of the audit and assessment covered 53 seed secondary schools’ construction projects with an overall total contract sum of UGX 111,860,803,846 and 57 health centre construction projects with an overall total contract sum of UGX 33,743,610,012.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of the Key findings noted, the details of which are included in the consolidated audit report for the 60 Local Governments and the 60 Individual reports issued separately;\\n\\n- In assessing the adequacy of the design process for the buildings, evidence of needs assessment, presence of geotechnical investigations report, design report, drawings and specifications were considered as key requirements, it was observed that detailed design reports were not availed to all local governments by the Ministry of Education.\\n\\n- Overpayments and irregular expenditure amounting to UGX 3,153,351,606 was noted during payment for construction works in some of the seed schools. Furthermore, UGX 3,588,640,939 were made without providing the breakdown of work items being certified.\\n\\n- During physical inspection of the Seed school infrastructure works, the participating LGs with exception of 3 LGs had defects such as honeycombing in concrete, absence of anti-sag rods, cracks in the ceilings, absence of expansion joint in the ICT blocks, exposed steel reinforcement, inadequate painting in the roof structures.\\n\\nThe observed defects, if not addressed, will result in increased maintenance costs for the local governments.\\n\\n- In assessing the adequacy of the design process for the buildings, evidence of needs assessment, presence of geotechnical investigations report, design report, drawings and specifications were considered as key requirements. It was observed that 39 local governments did not carry out needs assessment, geotechnical investigations, produce design reports in addition work specifications were also omitted.\\n\\n- Overpayments and irregular expenditure totalling to UGX 920,905,442 were noted during payment for construction works of the Health Centre IIs in LGs and municipalities. Furthermore, UGX 209,175,652 were made without providing the breakdown of work items being certified.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Review of the status of the contractors’ equipment mobilization under construction of HCs revealed that out of the 56 local governments, only the 4 local governments had evidence that the contractors mobilized all required equipment. Further, only 13 local governments had evidence that the contractors mobilized all required equipment under the construction of seed schools.\\n\\n- Review of land ownership revealed that 7 local governments did not avail any evidence of acquisition or ownership of the land on which the Seed schools and health centres were constructed.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting officers of the Local Governments to ensure that;\\n\\n- Prior to implementation of any infrastructural projects of similar nature; all due design procedures such as needs assessment, geotechnical investigations are undertaken and documented by the local governments to facilitate adequate designs.\\n\\n- Overpayments in respect of quantities certified in excess of the actual works executed worth UGX. 3,153,351,606 in the Education Sector and UGX. 920,905,442 in the Health Sector should be recovered. In addition, the technical officers should review the other items that were not part of the audit sample and have additional checks in the certification process to minimise the errors in quantification.\\n\\n- Investigate the basis of payment of the questionable amounts totalling to UGX.3,588,640,939 in the Education Sector and UGX.209,175,652 in the Health Sector and take appropriate action.\\n\\n- Enforce the requirement for contractors to fully mobilize adequate equipment to undertake the works. In addition, any demobilization during contract implementation should be with the written approval of the project manager/supervisor.\\n\\n- All the defects/omissions observed should be corrected. Furthermore, additional inspection of the contractor’s works should be undertaken and any defects identified remedied immediately.\\n\\n- Fast track the process of obtaining formal ownership of the land on which the infrastructure is being constructed. Going forward, Accounting Officers should ensure that projects of similar nature are constructed on land that is formally owned by the respective local government.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOwing to the challenges faced by the various local governments during the delivery of UgIFT infrastructure projects in the education and health sectors as highlighted in this report, audit observed that these challenges are a result of gaps/weaknesses in the planning and costing of works, enforcement of internal controls for certification, supervision and monitoring, and general contract management.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAccordingly, the relevant stakeholders should enhance the capacities of the local governments through involvement of local governments in the planning for future projects of similar nature, organizing tailor made trainings for technical staff, review of the staff structure in the engineering department and ensure that it is adequate and appropriately staffed. The relevant ministries should develop standardized guidelines for costing of civil works and strengthen the monitoring and supervision role in local governments.\\n\\n**4.3.**  \\nEngineering Audit of Selected Road and Building Projects in Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA)\\n\\nFor the financial year 2020/21, a total of 24 public works projects (Road upgrade/rehabilitation, signalization of road junctions, and building projects) with a total contract sum/value of UGX.333.72tn were implemented by KCCA. A sample of Eight (8) projects (road, signalization and building projects) with a contract value of UGX. 276.92tn. were selected for audit. This sample represents 82.98% of the value of the 24 projects.\\n\\nEight (8) of the KCCA projects were sampled for audit comprising of three (3) road projects funded by the World Bank under the Second Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (KIIDP 2) and five (5) projects funded by the Government of Uganda (GoU). The five projects funded by GoU comprised of three (3) road upgrading/ rehabilitation projects and two (2) building projects, the following key observations were noted on these projects\\n\\ni.  \\nDelayed relocation of existing services\\n\\nDelayed relocation of existing utilities for water and power for the three KIIDP road projects of Kulambira ring road 4.82Km, spur to Najjera road 0.7Km, Nakawa Ntinda road 2.8Km, Kabuusu –Bunamwaya – Lweza road 8.06Km and Lukuli road 7.71Km resulted in significant delays in execution of road works by up to 17 months. The Accounting Officer explained that public utility services by Statutory Undertakers (UMEME, NITA, UG POLICE, NWSC and UTL) in particular Kampala City are so complex that even the owners/operators do not know the exact location of their infrastructure, In addition, obtaining of shut-down permits from UMEME was always delayed as UMEME had to fit request within their planned shutdown programme.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that relocation of services is implemented in time, and works executed as per the approved work programme.\\n\\nii.  \\nUnjustified and overpayments amounting to UGX 1.355Bn\\n\\nIt was noted that on some of the projects, payments equivalent to UGX.1.355Bn had been made for quantities of works in excess of those executed, not backed up by the necessary payment supporting documentation or contrary to the contract conditions as follows;\\n\\n---\\n\\nTable 29: Unjustified Payments and Overpayments\\n\\n| S/No | Project Name | Payment (UGX) | Remarks |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | Upgrading to Paved Standards of | 80,849,062 | Payment of Unverified |  \\n|| Kulambiro Ring Road (4.82km) |<| NITA Relocations |  \\n|^| including Spur to Najjera Road  503,716,979.38 Unaccounted for Payments |<|<|  \\n|^| (0.7km), Reconstruction and  of for relocation of |<|<|  \\n|^| Dualling of Nakawa Ntinda Road  services |<|<|  \\n|^| (2.8km) (Including Signalization of | 215,992,827.81 | Payments for quantities of |  \\n|^| Four Junctions) and Reconstruction |<| works in excess of those |  \\n|^| and Widening of Acacia Avenue |<| executed |  \\n|^| (1.45km) (including Signalization of |<|<|  \\n|^| Six Junctions) – Lot 1 |<|<|  \\n| Upgrading to paved standard of Kabuusu –Bunamwaya – Lweza road (8.06Km) – Lot 2 56,860,150 348,214,079.83 Irregular Payment for Costs due to Extension of Time  Payments for quantities of works in excess of those executed 2 |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| Payments for quantities of works in excess of those executed 3 Upgrading of Cecila Road (1.3Km)  14,074,910 |<|<|<|  \\n| 4 | Construction of Kitintale Market – | 119,717,000 | Payments for quantities of |  \\n|| Phase I |<| steel reinforcement in |  \\n|^||<| excess of those in the bar |  \\n|^|^|<| bending schedule |  \\n| Payments for quantities of works in excess of those executed 5 Reconstruction of Ntinda II Road  16,213,200 |<|<|<|  \\n| TOTAL |<| 1,355,638,209 ||  \\n||<||<|  \\n\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the amounts certified and paid in excess of the quantities executed, unaccounted for payments and irregular/unjustified payments are recovered from the contractors prior to concluding the contracts.\\n\\niii.  \\nDelayed Land Acquisitions for the KIIDP Road projects\\n\\nThere was delayed acquisition of land by the Authority for the two KIIDP road projects of Kulambiro ring road 4.82 Km, Spur to Najjera road 0.7 Km, Nakawa Ntinda road 2.8 km and Acacia Avenue 1.45 Km under Lot 1, and Kabuusu – Bunamwaya – Lweza road 8.06Km for Lot 2 resulting in delays of more than 12 months significantly affected the progress and timely completion of the works on these projects. The Accounting Officer explained that it has always been the plan of KCCA to expedite land expropriation in time and issue commencement orders for sites that are free of any encumbrances, however the delayed land acquisition was caused by absentee land lords, and unwillingness by some PAPs to accept the Chief government Valuers value of compensation.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer that for future projects, the entity should ensure that contractors are issued with commencement orders when the site for construction is fully accessible.\\n\\n---\\n\\niv.  \\nFailure to undertake Ground Investigations for Building Projects\\n\\nDetailed ground investigations to inform the foundation designs were not undertaken during the design of Kitintatle Market and the Maternity ward at Kiswa Health Center. Such omissions can lead to inadequate designs which may compromise the safety of the buildings during usage. The Accounting Officer explained that for the Kitintale Market and Kiswa Health Center Projects, no funds were availed for geotechnical investigations\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that detailed ground investigations are undertaken to ensure that the constructed buildings can safely be put to usage when completed and going forward, the Accounting Officer should ensure that for projects of similar nature, detailed ground investigations are undertaken during the design phase.\\n\\n5.0. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AUDITS\\n\\nIn accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act (NAA) 2008, I am mandated to audit all the government investments and carry out special audit engagements that include information technology (IT) Audits. Accordingly, I planned and executed my audits following ISSAI 200: Fundamental Principles of Public-Sector Auditing and INTOSAI 5100 guidance.\\n\\nI conducted three (2) audits namely; Information Systems Audit of Civil Aviation Authority; the Academic Information Management System (AIMS) and Uganda National Land Information System (Ug-NLIS). Below are redacted version of my key findings.\\n\\n5.1.  \\nInformation Systems Audit of Civil Aviation Authority\\n\\n**i.** Disintegrated Systems/Manual Interfaces\\n\\nThe entity has twelve independent IT systems which are not integrated to share information. As such, information sharing was purely manual despite being explicitly provided for in the respective system requirements and contracts. This increases the risk of human errors and abuse during data extraction and re- entry. This was attributed to lack of integrated planning for IT interventions.\\n\\nFailure to automate sharing of information between systems compromises the data integrity, creates opportunities for fraudulent falsification of records. In addition, maintaining multiple systems increases maintenance costs and increases man hours because of manual extraction and entry of data which would otherwise be used for other productive activities.\\n\\nI advised management to comprehensively plan for IT projects. In the meantime, management may explore interfacing the systems as they plan to implement an Enterprise Resource System to ensure that various departments share data seamlessly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ii.**  \\nLack of Integrated Revenue Systems at CAA\\n\\nDespite a big shift to digitalisation and the Authority spending UGX.1.13Bn in acquiring a Passenger Tracking System with the aim of ascertaining the number and identity of passengers on a given flight, two years later, the system was not being used consistently and by-passed from time to time. As a result, the Authority has no independent mechanism to ascertain the number of passengers on each flight, but entirely depends on manual submissions from airlines to bill for revenues. There is a risk of under declaration of passengers which can lead to revenue loss. In addition, the system produces incomplete information.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, there is a risk that the amounts disclosed in the financial statements were not accurate and the system does not provide reliable information.\\n\\nI advised management to explore possibilities of enforcing the use of the system.\\n\\n**iii.** Failure to capitalise Information System Intangible Assets in the Financial Statements\\n\\nDespite spending UGX.4.723Bn on system development, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has not capitalised intangible assets. These include licenses, software, operating systems, subscriptions.\\n\\nAs a result, the assets value is understated in financial statements.\\n\\nManagement explained that they have engaged a consultant to carry out verification of all UCAA Assets; ICT Assets inclusive.\\n\\nI advised management to ensure that such assets are properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements.\\n\\n**iv.**  \\nFailure to implement Cargo Handling IT Systems\\n\\nOne of the major revenue streams of CAA is cargo handling fees levied on the airline operators. Although CAA contracted two companies through concession agreements where 5% is charged on cash exports, 10% on general handling and 10% on standard charge related to aircraft and passenger handling. The Authority does not have an independent system to track and reconcile the revenue collected before charging the percentage as per the concession agreements. The information is not shared in real-time due to lack of appropriate IT systems and they rely on information provided by the contractors.\\n\\nThis situation poses a risk of loss of revenue as a result of under-declaration of income from cargo handling operations by the handling companies.\\n\\nManagement explained that they have initiated procurement for extension of the Point of Sale (POS) system to new concessionaires. The Specifications include provision for interface with the existing Cargo Management systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised management to expedite the procurement and installation of the system. Meanwhile, CAA should engage the contractors to gain read-only access to the systems and extract accurate information for monitoring and reconciliation.\\n\\n**v.**  \\nTenants/Concessionaires without Point of Sale (POS) machines\\n\\nThe Point of Sale (POS) system is being used to track sales of airport tenants to inform the rental charges, which are a percentage of the sales. However, it was noted that after ten years of implementation, only 7 out of the 18 concessioners have POS terminals installed which creates a risk of revenue loss. I also noted that even for those using the POS system, were using them selectively, hence under-declaration of sales.\\n\\nIn addition, there is a risk that tax-free goods are being sold to non-passengers compounding revenue losses. This results into loss of revenue both to CAA and URA.\\n\\nManagement explained that they had 14 concessionaire locations at the deployment of the POS system in 2013. In addition, CAA will deploy a new system to cover the new locations and the procurement has been initiated.\\n\\nI advised management to fast-track the procurement and deployment of the new system.\\n\\n5.2. Information Systems Audit of the Academic Management Information System (AIMS)\\n\\n**i.**  \\nContested Ownership of the AIMS (Source Code)\\n\\nThe Ministry of ICT and National Guidance through its rationalization policy of promoting locally developed information systems agreed with Kyambogo University (KYU) to enhance its E-Kampus for sharing with other Public Universities and Self Accounting Tertiary Institutions (PUSATIs). Subsequently the user requirements were reviewed, functionalities improved and the system was rebranded to AIMS.\\n\\nA review of the framework contract between The Ministry of ICT and National Guidance and the supplier (Zeenode Uganda Limited) states that; the purchaser (MoICT&NG) acknowledges and agrees that the supplier and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights in the services and the documentation. It was brought to my attention during my review that there is a disagreement of ownership of the source code and the parties are in court.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the court decision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ii.**  \\nUnclear Ownership of the system\\n\\nThe Ministry of ICT & NG undertook the enhancement and deployment at the Public Universities and Self Accounting Tertiary Institutions (PUSATIs) of the E- Kampus into the AIMS under the innovation fund at a cost of UGX 2.1 Bn. Subsequently, the Ministry of ICT & NG procured technical support and maintenance services of the same system.\\n\\nHowever, I noted that the “vendor” (Zeenode) was charging UGX. 30,000 per student for use of the system.\\n\\nThis casts doubt on the ownership of the system. I further noted that the system was switched off for two weeks December 2020 over non-payment of service and maintenance fees.\\n\\nAs earlier noted, the case is before Court. I await Court’s decision.\\n\\n**iii.**  \\nNo right to audit provided in the contract\\n\\nThe contract between Ministry of ICT & NG and the supplier did not include any \"right to audit by third party\" clause. As a result, during the execution of the audit, I was denied access to key components of the Information system and I cannot provide assurance on their adequacy.\\n\\nManagement explained that it will consider including the clause on Right to Audit software, systems, data, in Contracts in collaboration with MoFPED and PPDA.\\n\\nI advised management to engage all stakeholders to make a provision for providing audit assurance in the contract.\\n\\n**iv.**  \\nFailure to update the Source Code held in Escrow\\n\\nThe contract between Ministry of ICT & NG and the supplier provides that any additions and inventions added by the purchaser and those that are unique to the purchaser will be documented and copyrighted to the purchaser upon installation and development.\\n\\nI noted, however, that even though the AIMS has been in continuous development for the last three years, there is no evidence that the original source code held in Escrow has been updated and neither was copyrighting of all changes to the AIMS after the contract signing.\\n\\nManagement acknowledged the omission and stated that the source code was not periodically updated. The Ministry committed to ensure continuous periodic updates to all source code held in Escrow.\\n\\nI advised management to keep the code updated in real time.\\n\\n**v.**  \\nData Ownership of the AIMS\\n\\nA review of the AIMS operations revealed that there is no clear data owner of the universities\\' data. The system vendor;\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Has unlimited access to the application that is used to process the PUSATI information.\\n- Has control over the AIMS database and operating system environment\\n- Has the only Administrator privileges on the AIMS for all the PUSATIs.\\n- Issues access rights to the AIMS system users.\\n\\nThis presents a conflict of interest as well as data integrity risk when the system developer has continuous access to the production environment.\\n\\nManagement explained that Clause 19 (ii) of the Framework contract specifies that each PUSATI shall own its individual data and processes that they run on the System. The Ministry shall ensure that remedial action is taken as per recommendation as part of the new Policy under development.\\n\\nI advised management to consider remedial action that would limit the risk of unlimited access and manipulation to both privileged and critical information of the PUSATIs\\n\\n**vi.**  \\nNo data protection after contract termination\\n\\nI noted that in the framework contract signed between the MoICT & NG and the supplier, there is no provision for how the PUSATI data is to be handled at the end of the contract. Without such a provision, the PUSATIs have no way to require the third party to return institutional data or otherwise dispose of such data in a way that does not jeopardise the information security and reputation of the institutions or their affiliated institutions.\\n\\nManagement committed to address the matter as part of the Policy on System development for Government.\\n\\nI advised management to devise means of ensuring that the data will be safely returned or destroyed in order to avoid the associated risks.\\n\\n**vii.**  \\nDeviation from the Contract terms by ZUL\\n\\nAlthough the Framework Contract between MoICT and the suppler stipulates that the supplier shall ensure uninterrupted and error-free services, on 12th December 2020, the supplier without consequence, denied services to all PUSATIs for a period of two weeks citing alleged non-payment by MoICT & NG. This led to loss of revenue, critical time and information loss thus delaying decision making.\\n\\nManagement promised to engage the vendor and ensure future contracts guard against such occurrences.\\n\\nI advised management to engage the Attorney General and devise means of protecting data as they wait for the disposal of the court case.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**viii.** Sustainability of the AIMS\\n\\nThe maintenance contract with the supplier expired in December 2020 and MoICT&NG had to pay the vendor an additional UGX.1Bn to guarantee continued support and maintenance until the 30th June 2021. It was proposed that beyond that period, PUSATIs would meet their own costs at UGX.30,000 per student per year, but there was no agreement or MOU with the system provider to ensure compliance by the PUSATIs. There is a risk of non-continued use of the system despite such investments by government.\\n\\nI advised management to ensure that all foreseeable costs of the system are analysed and evaluate sustainability of the project. In future, GoU should aim at outright acquisition or ownership and development of any public information system to avoid escalation of costs and ensure sustainability.\\n\\n**ix.**  \\nLack of Change Management Procedures\\n\\nAccording to Section A.12.1.2 of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Changes to the organisation, business processes, information processing, facilities and systems that affect information security shall be controlled. I established that no change management policies were in place at either MoICT&NG or the universities in regard to the AIMS and as such, Change Requests from users and other changes deemed fit by the supplier were implemented on the live environment without any documented authorisation from either MoICT or PUSATIs management.\\n\\nI advised management to integrate change management policies/procedures in project design and implementation.\\n\\n5.3. Information Systems Audit of Uganda National Land Information System (Ug- NLIS)\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda sought assistance from the World Bank to make reforms in the Lands Sector through the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP). The Modernizing of the land administration activity was implemented through a project named the \"Design, Supply, Installation and Implementation of the National Land Information System Infrastructure (DeSINLISI) by the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development (MLHUD). The main objective of the DeSINLISI) project was to establish a National Land Information System Infrastructure for the entire country to foster efficiency and transparency in land transactions processing as well as uphold the land tenure security.\\n\\nI undertook an audit of the system with the aim of assessing it effectiveness in supporting the land registration process to achieve intended objectives.\\n\\nBelow are the key findings: **i.** Land Registration Process\\n\\nI reviewed the land registration process and noted the following gaps that have led to poor service delivery:\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Despite investing substantial amounts of money in the land system, the land registration processes are largely still manual and no transactions take place without a manual file.\\n\\n- The system encourages rampant use of agents; sometimes, titles change hands four times before getting to the registrar.\\n\\n- Currently, changes on land titles are effected using manual typewriters, which are prone to error and waste time due to a requirement of scanning out to capture the manual changes.\\n\\n- There is no mechanism of communication to clients whose titles are ready; I noted that there are a number of duplicate copies of titles that have not been picked by clients, some as far back as 1997.\\n\\n- The system does not provide for functionality to perform electronic printing and sealing of land titles as a security feature in the certificate of titles.\\n\\nThe above gaps have led to unjustified delays in processing of land transactions, frustrating the public.\\n\\nI advised management to automate the land registration process; enhance system functionality to enable registered proprietors to create accounts to eliminate land agents (brokers) and an SMS alert system for the public to keep track of submitted applications.\\n\\n**ii.** Subdivision of plots\\n\\nThe workflow process is so lengthy as it has seventeen levels of approval with duplicated roles. District physical planners as key technical players were left out of the system workflow process. The system workflow process is not flexible to allow queries at different approval levels without cancellation of the transaction. In addition, the applications involving surveys are submitted physically at the Zonal office, despite the investment in the surveyor\\'s portal to aid the process.\\n\\nThe public frustration has led to unethical ways of quickening the process, thus creating fertile ground for corruption.\\n\\nManagement explained that it will enhance the land system functionality and workflow process to improve service delivery.\\n\\nI advised management to consider a review of the subdivision and workflow process to create efficiency.\\n\\n**iii.**  \\nFailure to Operationalise the Approved IT Staff Structure\\n\\nI noted that Ug-NLIS structure has not been operationalized with all senior positions still vacant despite the criticality of system to the country. Notably, system is largely supported by temporary short term contract staff who have not been recruited into main stream public service but continue to perform critical system roles such as database administration.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe use of temporary staff to oversee and support critical IT system exposes the entire investment to high risk. Management explained that they have made submission to the Public Service Commission (PSC).\\n\\nI advised management to follow up with the PSC to expedite the process.\\n\\n**iv.**  \\nFailure by Uganda Lands Commission (ULC) to Utilise the UG-NLIS\\n\\nI reviewed the Land information system and noted that Uganda Land Commission (ULC) does not utilize the Ug-NLIS to process land transactions (leases of public land). I noted that lease transactions were manually processed outside the system.\\n\\nIt should be noted that ULC was involved in the development of system and user requirements and acceptance of Ug-NLIS as a solution that meets the Commission’s business needs. Further, I noted that ULC acquired another system which duplicates the functionality of the Ug-NLIS at a cost of UGX.500 million.\\n\\nThe investment by ULC in a duplicate land registration system is deemed a wasteful expenditure. Management informed me that the Commission has commenced processing of public leases using the Ug-NLIS.\\n\\nI have advised Management to ensure that all public leases processed outside the Ug-NLIS should be captured into the system as a backlog.\\n\\n**v.** Overlapping Land Parcels\\n\\nThere are a number of parcels in the system whose geo-referenced coordinates were erroneously captured which created distortions in the cadastral data of the Ug-NLIS.\\n\\nThe errors manifest where parcels on the system stretch beyond the boundaries and overreach neighbouring parcels such as road reserves, protected areas and neighbouring plots. Where overlaps exist, the system may create delays in processing of deed plans or titles.\\n\\nManagement informed me that it has prioritised cadastral data cleaning.\\n\\nI advised Management to institute mechanisms to ensure quality control of survey data from surveyors and input validation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n6.0. SPECIAL VERIFICATIONS\\n\\nIn accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act, 2008, I undertook two special verifications in the telecom sector, and below is a summary of my findings;\\n\\n6.1.  \\nVerification of Assets and Liabilities for Uganda Telecom (In-Administration)\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 13(2) and 22 of the National Audit Act 2008, I undertook a special audit, for verification of liabilities of UTL comprising preferred taxes, UCC liability, UCECPS, administration costs, creditor payments and TDB Loan and assets on a request by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.\\n\\nBelow are the findings of the verification;\\n\\n**i.**  \\nVerification of Trade Development Bank Loan\\n\\nOut of the claimed USD.16.51 Million by Trade Development Bank, the verified and approved outstanding loan amounted to USD.9.31 Million The balance of USD.7.24 Million which relates to default interest charged during the period from 22 nd May 2017 to 31 st May 2021 when UTL was under administration, could not be verified, as it appears to be contrary to the Ugandan Insolvency Act 2011 and the attendant regulations, which provide that interest payable in respect of any period after the commencement of a liquidation and/or insolvency shall be suspended.\\n\\nGovernment was advised to seek the opinion of the Attorney General, before the amount relating to default interest is allowed.\\n\\n**ii.** Verification of Other Creditors\\n\\nI verified claims from the creditors as at 30 th June 2021 totalling to UGX. 302.74Bn as summarised in the table 30 below;\\n\\nTable 30: Creditors Verified\\n\\n| SN | Item | Amount - UGX |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | Consolidated Tax Liability (PAYE, Local Exercise, | 9,786,780,845 |  \\n|| Withholding Tax, Value Added Tax) |<|  \\n| 2 UCC liability  62,469,304,749 |<|<|  \\n| 3 | UCECPS liability | 2,353,904,321 |  \\n| 4  Verified Creditors Liability (Pre & Post Administration period) 63,079,412,417 |<|<|  \\n| 5 | Un remitted NSSF Deductions | 15, 462, 575,874 |  \\n| 6 UTL Pension Liability for former UPTC employees  165,048,246,917 |<|<|  \\n|| Total | 302,737,649,249 |  \\n\\n\\nI noted that creditors worth UGX. 28.74Bn were not verified due to insufficient information and creditors totalling to 336.3Bn were subject to court proceedings and therefore not verified.\\n\\n108\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Government should explore ways of settling the above liabilities to avoid litigation and associated costs.\\n\\n**iii.** Verification of Non-Current Assets\\n\\nThe current estimated value of UTL Non-Current Assets is UGX.184Bn which was computed based on independent valuers reports of M/s Bageine and Company (September 2017) and Elite Realty Limited (June 2018). Adjustments were made for depreciation and disposals since the valuation date to arrive at the current estimated value. There is need for re-valuation by the Chief Government Valuer to ascertain the current market values.\\n\\nIn addition, UTL has a 9.13% shareholding in a company (i.e. WIOCC) which was valued between USD.146.2 – 181.2 million, by an independent valuer commissioned by WIOCC in December 2020. The Administrator further informed me of an ongoing offer by an equity investor into WIOCC, who has valued the company at USD.171 million by the time of my verification. This would imply that the UTL shareholding of 9.13% in WIOCC, could be valued at USD.15.61 Million (i.e. approximately UGX.55.45Bn exchanged at UGX.3,551.71 for one USD), as of 30th June, 2021. This would significantly increase the value of total assets of UTL.\\n\\nThere are disputes on ownership of 11 Properties worth UGX.57.5Bn between Uganda Telecom Limited (UTL), POSTA (U) Ltd, Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC), and other entities.\\n\\nGovernment should consider resolving the disputes before liquidating the company. **iv.** Verification of Receivables\\n\\nReceivables totalling to UGX.113.65Bn were presented for verification. Due to time limitations and sensitivity of the matter, I could not verify receivables, however the process of verification had commenced under the administrator. I await the outcome of the verification exercise.\\n\\n6.2.  \\nVerification of Terminal Benefits/Pension of former Employees UPTC in Respect of Civil Appeal No. 230 Of 2013 And No.10 Of 2014 Of The Court Of Appeal Of Uganda\\n\\nI undertook a country wide verification exercise of 1,837 former employees/ claimants of the defunct Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (UPTC) in accordance with the orders of the Court of Appeal in respect to Civil Appeal No. 230 of 2013 and No. 10 of 2014.\\n\\nBelow are my findings;\\n\\nThe claims presented for verification in the actuarial report as at 30 th June 2020 and are summarized in the Table 31 below;\\n\\n109\\n\\n---\\n\\nTable 31: Summary of claims presented for Verification\\n\\n| S/N | Entity | Total No. of Claimants | Claim Amounts as at 30 th June |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n||<|<| 2020 - UGX |  \\n| 1 | UTL | 1,065 | 200,444,057,531 |  \\n| 2 UPL 348 35,249,791,537 |<|<|<|  \\n| 3 | PBUL | 8 | 135,780,242 |  \\n| 4 UCC 11 691,361,961 |<|<|<|  \\n| 5 | UPTC | 71 | 9,638,276,645 |  \\n| Total 1,503 246,159,267,916 |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nI verified the claims presented and summarized the findings per entity as presented below;\\n\\n**i.** Verified Claims – UGX.213,026,888,318\\n\\nThe total verified amount of UGX.213,026,888,318 is payable to 1,254 claimants under UTL (in-Administration), Uganda Posts Limited (UPL) and the defunct UPTC as summarised in the Table 35 below;\\n\\nTable 32: Summary of Verified claims payable\\n\\n| S/N Entity Total No. of Claimants Total claimants verified Total Amount Verified Payable as at June 2021- UGX |<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | UTL | 1,065 | 882 | 165,048,246,917 |  \\n| 2 UPL 348 337 43,233,738,001 |<|<|<|<|  \\n| 3 | UPTC | 71 | 35 | 4,744,903,400 |  \\n| Total 1,484 1,254 213,026,888,318 |<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nI advised the Government to make the necessary budgetary provisions to cater for settlement of the above claims.\\n\\n**ii.** Fully Settled Claims\\n\\nAlthough the Actuarial report from the Privatisation Unit under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) submitted included claims from former employees of Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) and Post Bank Uganda Limited (PBUL) respectively, from the verification carried out I verified that these entities had duly settled the claims of 21 beneficiaries totalling to UGX.1,124,966,993.\\n\\nThis verification gave assurance that the Government had fulfilled its obligation to the respective beneficiaries, thereby eliminating any risk of possible double payment of claims in this regard.\\n\\n110\\n\\n---\\n\\n**iii.**  \\nConflict between the legal representative and the beneficiaries\\n\\nDuring the audit, I obtained information relating to the fact that a section of the claimants had a disagreement with their legal advocate, allegedly from failure to remit funds received from UTL and UPL to all the claimants. UTL in Administration and UPL transferred a total of UGX.4,184,469,245 to the lawyer as part payment of their obligations.\\n\\nI advised the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) and the Attorney General to take note of the conflict and ensure that the dispute is resolved before funds are disbursed to benefit the rightful claimants.\\n\\n7.0.  \\nHIGHLIGHTS OF VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT RESULTS\\n\\n7.1. Value for Money Audit on the Management of Government Investments by Uganda Development Corporation\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda has committed over UGX.223.9Bn in various investment projects under Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) over the years 2016/17 to 2019/20. These investments which are highlighted as government priorities from National Development Plan (NDP I), through to NDP III, are meant to promote social and economic development and contribute to poverty eradication by increasing national and regional economic growth and development.\\n\\nThe objective of the value for money audit was to assess the effectiveness of UDC processes in the management of Government Investments through planning, implementation and monitoring of such investments.\\n\\nI sampled eight (8) investment projects worth UGX. 191.5 Bn as of 30 th June, 2020 including; Soroti Fruit factory, Kigezi Highland Tea factory, Kayonza Tea factory, Mabale tea factory, Luwero Fruits factory, Moroto Cement factory, Isingiro Fruit factory and Atiak Sugar Factory.\\n\\nThe following were the key findings; **i.** Project Planning\\n\\nI noted that only one out of the eight selected projects was dully subjected to the planning process representing 12.5%. The objective of the planning process is to justify investment of government funds in identified projects. As a result of ineffective planning, two projects failed to take off while there was a change of scope, cost and implementation strategy for the other five investment projects.\\n\\n111\\n\\n---\\n\\nUDC management should ensure that all Investment projects follow the due planning and identification processes as documented in the investment guide. This will increase on the success rate for those projects that are properly planned, identified and appraised.\\n\\n**ii.** Project Implementation\\n\\nAudit noted that UDC had not been able to have five investment projects operating at full capacity as expected representing 37.5% of the eight sampled projects. The projects faced different challenges as summarised in the table 33 below;\\n\\nTable 33: Challenges of Project Implementation\\n\\n| S/N | Project Name | Amount Invested as at 30 th June | Challenge |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n||<| 2020 (UGX in Bn) |<|  \\n| 01 | Soroti Fruit factory | 23.76 | Additional machinery was |  \\n||<|<| procured to cater for the user |  \\n|^|<|<| needs not identified at planning |  \\n|^|<|<| stage |  \\n| 02 Kigezi Highland 14.03  leading Additional funds to support raw material uptake to project cost-overruns |<|<|<|  \\n| 03 | Mabale Tea Factory | 16.6 | Change of user needs during |  \\n||<|<| implementation |  \\n| 04 Kayonza tea factory 14.06 Project satisfactory objective of decision on Government realised. performance however, the  the  is yet is the investment of to be part |<|<|<|  \\n| 05 | Atiak Sugar factory | 88.8 | Inadequate inputs to match the |  \\n||<|<| factory capacity |  \\n| Total  157.25 |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nManagement should improve implementation processes by ensuring that guidelines are in place, and that sufficient staffing is deployed. Additionally, the institution should lobby for a ‘Fund-based’ financing approach of the institution, instead of ‘projectised’ financing where funds are sent to UDC already tagged to an investment project to be funded. This will allow flexibility during implementation of investment projects.\\n\\n112\\n\\n---\\n\\n**iii.** Monitoring and Evaluation\\n\\nI noted that the oversight role in all the eight sampled investment projects had not been fully undertaken and thus, the projects were not operating at full capacity as expected. This was greatly attributed to weak governance structures and non-existing/inadequate Boards in those investment projects supported as partnership ventures. This ultimately caused delays in decision making, financing and signing of contractual agreements.\\n\\nUDC management should improve the monitoring and oversight role in the government investments by ensuring that the monitoring frameworks are established and followed- up at both management and Board levels.  \\nOverall Conclusion\\n\\nGovernment has invested over UGX.200Bn in various sectors of the economy with the objective of boosting value addition mainly in the agricultural sector. There has been a noted increase in both tea and sugar production. It should however be noted that the levels of outputs and other expected benefits are not commensurate with the investments due to challenges of budgeting and planning, lack of feasibility studies and criteria for allocation of funding, inadequate contractual arrangements to clarify roles and targets and limited oversight and monitoring of investments. There is a risk of failure to achieve the intended objectives. There is still potential for improvement by ensuring UDC staffing levels are increased to undertake the above-mentioned tasks. It is also necessary to enhance autonomy for UDC by providing capitalisation instead of project related financing, so that management is flexible in allocation and re-allocate resources where they are urgently required at the time.\\n\\n7.2.  \\nA Value for Money Draft Audit Report on The Afforestation and Restoration of Selected Central Forest Reserves (CFRs) by the National Forestry Authority (NFA)\\n\\nThe National Forestry Authority (NFA) was established under section 52 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 (NFTPA). The objective of NFA is to manage the Central Forest reserves, expand and promote partnership arrangements, ensure equitable supply of forest and non-forest products and services and enhance organisational sustainability.\\n\\nThe country’s forest cover is managed by different stakeholders comprising; Uganda Wildlife Authority, National Forestry Authority and Privately owned forest plantations.\\n\\nThe forest cover loss over the years from 1990 to the last biomass study in 2017 is estimated at 58.9%. Similarly, the CFR forest cover under NFA dropped from 62.5% (791,240ha) of the NFA forest cover to 45.8% (579,257ha) in the same period. This trend was contrary to Sustainable Development Goal 15 which required governments to ensure the restoration of forests and increase forest cover in line with obligations under international agreements by 2020.\\n\\nThe overall objective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place by the NFA towards the restoration and establishment of new plantations in the central forest reserves, between the period of 2016 and 2020.\\n\\n113\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe following are the key findings from the study;\\n\\n**i.**  \\nRestoration and establishment of new plantations\\n\\nAudit noted that management achieved 11,173ha (78%) of their planned outputs (14,277ha) for both restoration planting and establishing new tree plantations, which contributed to only 0.88% of the national forest cover (1,265,742ha) over the four-year period.\\n\\nConsidering the current rate of forest restoration, it will require 75.8 years for NFA to restore the national forest cover to 62.5% of was it was in the year 1990.Similarly, even if NFA was to meet its targets of 14,277ha in the four-year period, it would still take 59.3 years to restore the CFRs to the 1990 forest cover in Uganda.\\n\\nThe non-achievement of targets to restore forest cover was caused by inadequacies in the planning and budgeting process; land management; monitoring and inspections; and collaboration with institutional stakeholders.\\n\\n**ii.**  \\nCoordination and planning in the Forest Sector\\n\\nI noted weaknesses in coordination in the regulation of activities/projects under a single mandate that impact of national forest cover. There are inconsistencies and inadequacies in mainstreaming initiatives to increase forest cover across government and private sector which has led to limited national forest coverage of 12.4% and NFA forest cover of 45.8%.\\n\\n**iii.**  \\nMonitoring and Evaluation, and inspections.\\n\\nIt was observed that out of the expected 16 monitoring reports in the four-year period ending 30th June, 2020, only 4 (25%) were prepared in the entire four-year period. In addition, NFA budgeted to receive UGX.320m for monitoring in the four years under review, however, it received UGX.91.8million (29%) of which UGX 88.8million was spent. There was limited uptake of monitoring and evaluation recommendations which led to led to destruction of the newly restored forests by encroachers.\\n\\n**iv.** NFA collaborations\\n\\nIt was established that seventeen (17) MOUs were signed with different government agencies, out of the planned twenty (20), representing an 85% performance. Although these collaborations contributed to the restoration and establishment of new plantations, there were inadequacies in providing the planned quantity of seedings.\\n\\nIn addition, twenty (20) Collaborative Forest management (CFM) agreements were signed with forest edge communities, out of the planned twenty-eight (28) over the last three years. There were inadequacies of; staffing, limited sensitization and coordination between the CFM stakeholders. As a result, communities were sighted to be involved in encroachment of newly restored forests in some instances.\\n\\n114\\n\\n---\\n\\nKey Recommendations  \\nThe National Forestry Authority should;\\n\\n- Engage all relevant stakeholders to ensure sustainable coordination and comprehensive planning initiatives to enhance mainstreaming efforts to increase forest cover in the country.\\n\\n- Improve on its collaboration and sensitization efforts with all stakeholders to protect all forest land and undertake a process of titling all gazetted forest reserves and national forests to curb illegal encroachment. The National Land Information System (NLIS) should include control measures to prevent illegal titling of gazetted forest land.\\n\\n- Continue engaging the relevant Government authorities to fast-track the revision and approval of the NFA organizational structure, to enhance the institutional capacity to manage national forests.\\n\\nOverall Conclusion\\n\\nWhereas the National Forestry Authority has undertaken specific interventions aimed at increasing forest cover through restoration and establishing new plantations; inadequate coordination, planning, monitoring, collaboration with communities have led to a limited increase in the NFA forest cover over the years. In some instances, increased encroachment, land encumbrances through issuance of title over the NFA land, limited community sensitization and involvement, inadequate prioritization of restoration and new forest establishment have contributed to the dismal 45.8% forest cover under NFA and national cover of 12.3%.\\n\\nIt is hoped that despite the increased population that is exerting pressure on the rather limited national forest cover, the lessons learnt and recommendations will be applied to fulfil the objectives of the NFA, forest sector and country.\\n\\n7.3.  \\nA Value for Money Audit on the Implementation of the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD)\\n\\nI undertook a Value for Money to assess the extent to which the Programme achieved its intended objectives.\\n\\nThe Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) is an initiative of the Government of Uganda that is aimed at empowering women to improve their income levels and their contribution to economic development; by improving their access to financial services and equipping them with skills for enterprise growth, value addition and marketing of their products and services.\\n\\nThe Programme has disbursed UGX.107 Bn to 11,256 women groups, benefitting over 135,000 women, over the five-year period (2015/16 to 2019/20) in the first Phase. The\\n\\n115\\n\\n---\\n\\nprogramme through its revolving fund recovered over UGX.16 billion from the loans disbursed to the women which funds were available for financing new women groups.\\n\\nDespite the achievements registered, the audit identified the following areas that need to be addressed by the Ministry;\\n\\n- I noted that 4,185 women had benefited from the Programme under the capacity and skills development component, which translates into 42% of the desired target (10,000 women) according to the UWEP Programme document.\\n\\n- There were delays in disbursement of funds to the women groups. In some cases, the delays were more than 12 months from time of approval of the applications to receipt of the funds which affected the performance and success of enterprises, specifically those in the agricultural sector, which depend on the rainy seasons for planting. The delays impact on agricultural yields.\\n\\n- I noted budget cuts for women groups at the MGLSD level (TSU) with some groups receiving less than budgeted funds to implement their enterprises; however, at the Local Government level, explanations for the budget revisions were not effectively communicated to the groups; which hindered implementation of activities of women groups.\\n\\n- Funds to the tune of UGX 16 Bn remained idle on the recovery account in Bank of Uganda over the five years. Only 6% (UGX 963 million) of the amount had been re- disbursed; which denied the other qualifying women groups access to funds.\\n\\n- The MGLSD through the UWEP Technical Support Unit did not effectively plan for and coordinate implementation of the activities to facilitate women groups to access markets for their products. In addition, access to appropriate technologies were not catered for in the project design and budgets for the entire 5-year period. The intended objective of the funds disbursed may not be fully realised.\\n\\n- There was underfunding of monitoring and supervision activities at the Local Government level which affected the frequency of monitoring of beneficiary women groups. The programme gaps at enterprise level could not be adequately identified and corrected on time.\\n\\n- At the National level, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) undertook only 13 (43%) of the planned 30 monitoring and supervision visits to the regions throughout the five- year period. This resulted in delayed identification of performance gaps and timely remedial actions.\\n\\nKey Recommendations  \\nI advised management to do the following;\\n\\n- Prioritize the capacity and skills development component of the Programme through increased sensitization to ensure that women groups receive the required skills to\\n\\n116\\n\\n---\\n\\neffectively implement selected enterprises. In addition, consider reviewing the funding programme requirements to make training a prerequisite for all groups venturing into value addition enterprises for the first time.\\n\\n- The programme implementation guidelines should be reviewed to reduce on the time taken between approval and disbursement to improve timely access to funding to the groups. All budgetary cuts should be communicated to beneficiary women groups in time.\\n\\n- The MGLSD should ensure that the funds recovered are revolved in a timely manner to benefit the intended women groups, and ensure sustainability of the Programme.\\n\\n- The MGLSD should liaise with MoFPED to mobilise funds to cater for value addition, and monitoring and evaluation activities within the programme.\\n\\nOverall Concluion\\n\\nUWEP exceeded its target in attracting 100,000 women beneficiaries over the five year period and managed to put in place implementation guidelines and training of beneficiaries and implementing partners.\\n\\nHowever, utilization of funds from the programme’ revolving fund and equipping beneficiaries with value addition and skills for enterprise growth was found to be unsatisfactory and merits Management’s urgent intervention.\\n\\nThe overall prospects of the programme are promising if the challenges of rationalization of the programme funding; delayed funding of beneficiaries; limited focus on skills and capacity development; inadequate coordination of partnering institutions; are addressed.\\n\\n7.4. A Value for Money Audit Report on the Management of Research Grants by Public Universities in Uganda\\n\\nResearch is any type of systematic investigation, testing and evaluation whose objective is to discover new facts or information and increase the stock of knowledge. It generates new knowledge, which is critical for sustained economic growth and social transformation of Nations.\\n\\nAccording to Section 24(2)(a) of the Universities and other Tertiary Institutions Act, 2001 (as amended), a Public University has a function of provision of higher education, promotion of research and advancement of learning. Research is a costly activity and often relies on grants to supplement the existing financial resources. Research grants enable the research community within the Universities to thrive in knowledge sharing and to use research towards solving community-based problems.\\n\\nOwing to the different challenges in the management of research grants at public universities which is characterised by poor rankings of the universities at continental and world level, and less innovation products from the public universities, the Office of the\\n\\n117\\n\\n---\\n\\nAuditor General undertook an independent assessment of the management of research grants by Public Universities.\\n\\nThe overall audit objective was to assess the adequacy of management of research grants in achieving grant management objectives in Public Universities in Uganda. The audit adopted a case study approach whereby 4 out of the 9 Public Universities in Uganda were considered as cases for the study, these included; Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST), Kyambogo University and Busitema University. Below is a summary of key findings and recommendations, the details are found in the subsequent part of the report;\\n\\nKey Findings\\n\\n**i.**  \\nInstitutional framework for coordination of research grants activities\\n\\n- It was noted that all the Public Universities through their respective Councils determine the research policies, research management structures and research direction of the respective Universities. There is no framework to ensure collective planning, coordination and follow-up of research efforts for the different Public Universities to ensure equitable allocation of resources, efficient utilization of academic staff, and that research results contribute to National development.\\n\\n- It was also established that key research and grant management policies/guidelines were missing at a number of Universities to guide on the efficient and effective management of research activities. Only MUST and Busitema had a grants management policy/manual to guide their grants management processes. Furthermore, the country lacks national regulations and guidelines for research and innovation activities including; sourcing of external grants, development and uptake of technologies and, management and commercialization of intellectual properties.\\n- Furthermore, the research committees for MUK, MUST and Kyambogo which are responsible for strategic planning and research direction focused more on graduate students’ research with limited emphasis on university grants research.\\n\\n- It was also noted that out of the 4 Universities, only MUST had a grants office under the DRGT with dedicated staff to support grant activities. It was further noted that Busitema and Kyambogo did not have grants administrators at college/faculty level while at MUK and MUST only the college of Health Sciences and the faculty of medicine respectively had grant administrators to undertake the tasks.\\n\\n- The most funded area of the research agenda for MUK was health and health systems which accounted for over 50% of the funding with other areas of research getting smaller contributions. In addition, no operational processes were in place to ensure that external grants sourced by MUK & KYU staff are in line with the university’s research agenda. MUST and Busitema University did not have an approved research agenda at University level. Furthermore, the country does not have a clear research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy making.\\n\\n118\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ii.** Resource Mobilization Initiatives\\n\\n- It was found that MUK, KYU and Busitema have established processes to centrally award competitive research grants from internally generated funds or Government support as initiatives to promote research and innovation in public universities. These processes have in turn enabled staff to seek external grants through proposal writing. The processes however have challenges. MUST on the other hand has not established such processes.\\n\\n- Out of the 4 universities, only MUK had a consolidated Research Innovation Fund (RIF) for research funds from government. Through continuous lobbying by MUK, government allocated UGX.30bn to the fund; the other universities have not explored this initiative. All the universities have not raised any resources internally into a separate fund for research. This was attributed to government policy of remitting all internally generated revenue into the consolidated fund and therefore appropriating funds through the annual budget process.\\n\\n- It was noted that for all the 348 grants sampled from the four (4) universities, overheads/indirect costs were not deducted from the funds spent contrary to percentage requirements in the research and grant policies of the universities.\\n\\n**iii.** Monitoring and Evaluation\\n\\n- In all the four Universities, M&E was not carried out by the university management on external research grants for the period 2017/18-2019/20. 193 out of 348 (55.5%) sampled external grants were however monitored by the donors. For internal grants, only 222 grants under MUK RIF were monitored.\\n\\n- It was noted that even where M&E was undertaken by donors, recommendations were not fully implemented by the Universities.\\n- 450 out of 512 Government funded Grants from MUK, Kyambogo and Busitema, representing 87.9% were not completed in time during the period under review. Similarly, 218 out of 350 (62.3%) Donor funded Grants from the 4 universities were not completed in time.\\n\\nKey Recommendations\\n\\n- The Ministry of Education and Sports should institute a committee with full representation from all public universities and supported with relevant legislation to collectively undertake strategic planning for university research in line with the National Development Plan and ensure adequate coordination between universities, follow-up of research activities, equitable allocation of resources and efficient utilization of academic staff on research.\\n\\n- The NCHE should introduce a standard legal framework for evaluation of management of research activities in the universities. The Universities should then take the responsibility for mainstreaming the instituted framework into their management system. Regular audits of planned university research activities vis a vis expected outputs should be undertaken.\\n\\n119\\n\\n---\\n\\n- The public universities should prioritize development of key research and grant management policies to guide the related processes. Benchmarking with leading universities in the region and at the continental level can be used to ease the process and ensure up-to-date policies with the changing environment.\\n\\n- Government and related institutions should fast track the development of policies, strategies and guidelines to promote research, technology development and, uptake and management & commercialization of Intellectual Properties (IPs) as provided for in the NDP III.\\n\\n- The public universities should have different Senate/Management committees for the different roles of governing graduate programs and students on one hand and research and innovations activities including grants management on the other hand. This would ensure adequate focus on strategic planning for research, management and follow-up of research activities at the university for timely achievement of university research objectives.\\n\\n- The public universities should engage with MoPS, MoFPED and MoES for support to fill the key staffing gaps for grants management and ensure that the necessary key roles such as grants administration and M&E are undertaken.\\n\\n- Government through the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should prioritise funding/grants for research in public universities to enable focus on research which is in line with university research agendas and national priorities.\\n\\n- Government and related institutions should fast track the development of the national research agenda to guide planning, implementation and policy making as provided for in the NDP III.\\n- The Universities’ management should institute Committees to follow up and review the implementation of recommendations on project or grant monitoring and Evaluation for improvement in the management of research grants in the University.\\n\\nOverall Audit Conclusion\\n\\nDespite the challenges noted in the management of Research Grants, Public Universities have, achieved some notable research outputs through research grants with outstanding innovations which included; production of an electric automobile, crop protection systems, farming systems for generating biofuel, improved water treatment, low cost MakaPads for the girl child, production of energy, and secure fertilizers all at Makerere University. Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) has also been able to produce traditional health care products at its Pharm-Biotechnology and traditional medicine centre, while Kyambogo produced an improved low-cost baby incubator and an online Academic Information Management System (AIMS), which is used by all public universities in the country.\\n\\nThere are still bottlenecks in management of Research Grants in Public Universities which have affected achievement of the university research objectives. These included; gaps in\\n\\n120\\n\\n---\\n\\nthe Institutional Framework for coordination of research grants, inadequate resource mobilization initiatives, inadequate implementation of research projects, lack of monitoring and evaluation framework, and absence of a joint organ to oversee and regulate research initiatives in public universities in the country.\\n\\nIt is hoped that when the recommendations in this report are implemented; the universities will effectively manage research grants, thus attaining the objectives of their research agendas.\\n\\n7.5.  \\nValue for Money Audit on The Management Of MATIP-1 Markets by Municipalities\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda through MATIP-1 redeveloped and reconstructed seven (7) markets at a cost of USD.64.5 million to create a conducive trade environment and increase revenue collections for the municipalities. The seven (7) markets that were redeveloped were; Mpanga market, Hoima Central market, Mbale Central market, Jinja Central market, Gulu Central market, Wandegeya market and Lira central market.\\n\\nThis study assessed whether the municipalities had ensured that the redeveloped markets created a conducive trade environment and increased revenue collections for the municipalities.\\n\\nThe redevelopment of the seven (7) markets resulted in an increase in the number of vendors trading in these markets from 14,826 vendors in 2015 to 19,481 Vendors in 2021 which is a growth of 31%. In addition, market management structures comprising of staff of the Municipalities as well as vendor associations were established in all the markets and supported the Municipalities in their role of managing the markets through mobilizing vendors to participate in market activities such as trainings in running small scale businesses, market cleaning, and sensitizations in market security, trade order and hygiene.\\n\\nDespite these achievements, the study noted areas that require attention if the management of these markets is to improve;\\n\\n- The study revealed that the annual revenue budgets or targets of all the seven (7) markets were consistently below their revenue potential by 38%. Whereas the revenue potential for the markets was UGX.32.8Bn over the 6 years reviewed, the markets only budgeted to collect UGX.12.5Bn over the period. This was attributed to lack of a management information systems and the manner in which the municipalities develop the revenue budgets based on prior year collections instead of using actual market occupancy. Unrealistically low budgets imply that the revenue performance is likely to be below the market potential.\\n\\n- Out of the budget of UGX.12.5Bn by these markets for the six-year period, only UGX.7.9Bn was collected representing a performance of 54%. This was due to lack of automated revenue management system, leaseholders who were not paying monthly market rents, unoccupied stalls and lockups, irregular subletting, and the failure to terminate tenancy of rent defaulters. Under collection of revenues has affected the\\n\\n121\\n\\n---\\n\\nability of these markets to meet their obligations which has resulted into accumulation of arrears totalling to UGX.1.41Bn in the seven (7) markets.\\n\\n- Four (4) markets of Mbale, Gulu, Lira and Jinja were overcrowded with the vendor- occupancy exceeding the markets’ design capacity by 36% due to over allocation of market spaces, illegal traders and sub-lettees, inadequate enforcement by the municipality and design deficiencies such as poor lighting in some sections, and lack of accessibility. The overcrowding has caused congestion in the markets.\\n\\n- The majority of vendors all the seven (7) markets were not trading in the established zones due to insufficient space in zones, allocation of spaces to traders outside their designated zones, rejection of the stalls by vendors, and weak enforcement of zoning. This has resulted in a disorganised market environment which continues to present challenges for customers and traders.\\n\\n- All the seven (7) markets had failed to maintain adequate sanitation within the markets due to overcrowding of the markets, weaknesses in the supervision of the cleaning staff and cleaning contracts, insufficient number of garbage trucks, skips, bins, garbage banks and landfills. The poor sanitation makes the markets unsightly for the customers and poses health risks for both the traders and customers such as food contamination and air pollution.\\n\\n- The market infrastructure was not well maintained for all the markets. There were cases of leaking roofs, walls with old peeling paint, cracked floors, non-functioning toilets, failed water pumps, un-serviced generators and firefighting equipment, and non-functioning CCTV security equipment. Inadequate maintenance of the market infrastructure was attributed to failure to prioritize this activity by the municipalities, and failure to set aside maintenance funds as recommended in the market maintenance guidelines. Failure to maintain infrastructure has resulted in accelerated deterioration of the newly constructed markets.\\n\\nIn order to address the gaps identified, the municipalities should roll out automated revenue management systems in all the markets, enforce terms of tenancy agreements in relation to sub-letting, invoicing and payment of rent, modify the market structures to allow for better lighting and improved access. The municipalities should also address the issue of illegal occupants, and develop guidelines to regulate sub-letting.\\n\\nThe municipalities should review the current markets layout to address the challenges of zoning, and overcrowding. In addition, there is need to enhance supervision of market cleaning and prioritise the maintenance of the market structures.\\n\\n7.6.  \\nPrevention and Response to Incidents of Fire by Uganda Police Force.\\n\\nDirectorate of Fire Prevention and Emergency Rescue Services (DFPERS) is one of the directorates in the Uganda Police Force. Its major role is to enhance capacity for prevention of emergencies and delivery of rescue services in order to deliver on its functions of fire prevention, fire suppression and emergence rescue. The directorate operates eleven (11) fire stations in Kampala Metropolitan Area and thirty-four (34) others stations across the country.\\n\\n122\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis study assessed the extent to which DFPERS has put in place measures to prevent and respond to fire outbreaks. The Directorate of Fire and Rescue services has made notable achievements over its nine years of existence as illustrated below;\\n\\nFollowing the creation of DFPERS in 2012 the number of fire stations in the country has increased by thirty-one (31) which has improved access to fire services. In addition, coordination with stakeholders in preventing and responding to fire by DFPERS has improved and a total of 4,131 have been responded to in the last four years thus saving lives and property. Despite the achievements registered, the audit identified the following areas that need to be addressed.\\n\\n- The Directorate of Fire and Rescue Services (DFPERS) undertakes activities aimed at preventing the outbreak of fire and incidents that require emergency response. The study observed that the Directorate faced challenges in preventing the occurrence of fire. These include;\\n\\n\\uf076 DFPERS did not have fire and safety Act, regulations, and policies to aid the operations of the directorate in prevention. Because of this the Directorate was unable to effectively carry out risk assessment, sensitization of the public, inspection of buildings by DFPERS staff, and carry out post incident investigations as indicated below.\\n\\n\\uf076 DFPERS has not undertaken any comprehensive assessment of risks relating to occurrence of fire incidents in order to develop appropriate prevention and response measures/strategies to control fire outbreaks which has affected the directorate’s ability to develop appropriate fire prevention strategies.\\n\\n\\uf076 DFPERS undertook only 873 (29%) out of the planned 3,020 sensitisations in the past four (4) years. This has continued to expose buildings and their occupants to fire outbreaks and limited the capacity of citizens to prevent the occurrence of such incidents.\\n\\n\\uf076 DFPERS undertook only 527 (17%) out of the planned 3,080 inspections in the past four (4) years. This affects the level of compliance to fire standards which increases the probability of fire outbreaks which can lead to loss of life and damage to property.\\n\\nThe study also noted the following weaknesses on the side of the Fire department:\\n\\n- DFPERS did not undertake post incident investigations to ascertain the cause, extent of damage or loss from the fires and lessons for prevention of re-occurrence of similar incidents on the 3,179 incidents of fire reported during the past three years due to lack of equipment and trained investigators and coordination with other government investigative bodies. This has resulted into non-conclusion of investigations hence continued public dissatisfaction on the way Uganda Police Force handles fire investigations.\\n\\n123\\n\\n---\\n\\n- In addition to fire prevention, DFPERS responds to fire outbreaks to minimize the impact of fire on people’s lives and property. The Directorate faced challenges in responding to fire outbreaks due to limited number of fire stations, inadequate staff, lack of enough equipment and non-automation of operations to respond to fires as indicated below;\\n\\n- DFPERS is currently operating forty-five (45) fire stations in thirty-eight (38) districts to respond to cases of fire outbreaks across the country which is only 27% coverage of the total number of districts in the country due to the high cost of opening and operating fire stations. This has resulted into DFPERS’ ineffectiveness in responding to incidents of fire across the country.\\n\\n- DFPERS currently has 599 fire staff against an approved establishment of 1,081 staff representing staffing levels of 55% implying that the current fireman to population ratio in Uganda is 1:75,000 compared to the recommended international ratio of 1:2,000. The existing staff were also not well trained and lacked adequate accommodation.\\n\\n- The equipment at the fire stations were inadequate in terms of quantity and functionality (not well maintained) to support effective response in the event of fire incidents. DFPERS had only 78 out of 232 equipment required to handle fire incidents representing 34% level of required equipment capacity. In addition, it was noted that firemen lacked adequate PPEs for use during fire response.\\n\\n- The fire stations inspected were not automated and information was recorded in manual books there were also no computers and communication systems which affected the efficiency and coherence of DFPERS response in the event of fire outbreak.\\n- DFPERS coordinates with some stakeholders such as Local Governments, NWSC, DGAL, CIID, Hospital emergency units, Civil Aviation Authority and Uganda Red Cross Society however this coordination is informal and characterized by slow decision making which affects response time.\\n\\nKey Recommendations\\n\\nI advised DFPER to engage the Ministry of internal Affairs to develop a comprehensive fire and safety Act, policy and guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to streamline risk assessment, sensitisation, inspection and post incident investigations. In addition, DFPERS should enhance coordination mechanisms with internal and external players to support its operations particularly post incident investigations.\\n\\nDFPERS should prioritize increasing coverage of fire stations to at least 50% of the districts and develop strategies to ensure the population fire man ratio of 1:75,000 is matched to internationally recommended ratio of 1: 2,000. In addition, UPF should undertake an assessment of the current accommodation needs with a view of developing strategies to address the current inadequacies in accommodation. UPF should prioritise the acquisition of equipment, PPEs and automation of the current communication and record management systems to ensure that there is an effective\\n\\n124\\n\\n---\\n\\nresponse to fire incidents enhance on the operational efficiency during responses to incidents of fire outbreaks\\n\\n7.7.  \\nValue for Money Audit on the Performance of the Performance of the Agriculture Cluster Development Project\\n\\nGovernment has implemented the Agriculture Cluster Development Project (ACDP) with an overall objective of raising on-farm productivity, production and marketable volumes of selected agricultural commodities (Maize, Beans, Cassava, Rice, and Coffee) in twelve (12) clusters in fifty-seven (57) districts across the country. The project is funded through IDA Credit worth UGX.540Bn and farmer contribution of UGX.352.8Bn and implemented through the e-voucher management system.\\n\\nThe intervention has resulted into distribution of 60,124 tonnes of beans, maize, and rice and 49,871 bags of cassava planting materials to 245,510 farmers/beneficiaries by the agro-dealers between 2018/2019 and 2020/2021. The intervention has also resulted into increased the marketable volumes from 11.94MT to 33.28MT in the past three years.\\n\\nDespite the achievements registered, the study identified areas that need to be addressed. The following key observations were noted;\\n\\n- The project delayed to commence by 20 months’ due delays in obtaining the necessary approvals from cabinet and parliament (20 months) and delayed fulfilment of the project effectiveness conditions (26 months) which led to late implementation of project activities and service delivery.\\n\\n- Despite the project achieving more than 70% in five (5) districts in training of Local Government Staff and farmers on system use and financial literacy, the project did not perform satisfactorily in twenty-three (23) districts where twenty-seven (27) trainings had been planned. As a consequence, a number of farmers were unable to transition from the first cropping cycle to the third cropping cycle.\\n\\n- Out of the targeted 450,000 farmers, 204,490 (46%) farmers did not access inputs through the e-voucher system. With only one year left to the end of the project, the project may not achieve its intended objective.\\n\\n- The inputs that were distributed to the farmers were not verified by UNBS because of absence of a streamlined quality control process. As a result, farmers reported cases where seeds did not germinate and fertilizers that “just hardened the soils” were distributed by the Agro-dealers. This has compromised the process of ensuring farmers get the best quality inputs since the department is limited in capacity to undertake this activity.\\n\\n- The project did not achieve the intended targets in the three areas below in the three years of implementation.\\n\\n125\\n\\n---\\n\\no Only 207 Area Commodity Cooperative Enterprises (ACCEs) (69%) and 155 Rural Producer Organisations (RPOs) (5%) have been supported with value addition facilities out of the targeted 300 ACCEs and 3000 RPOs in the six-year project life span.  \\no  \\nOut of 1,835 farmers in the cooperatives that received matching grants for the value addition facilities, only 585 farmers (31.9%) were enrolled on the e-voucher system which made it difficult for the project to reach its targeted 450,000 farmers.  \\no The project had planned to rehabilitate a total of 2,827.7km planned road chokes however, only 228.1km (8%) had been rehabilitated representing 8% of the overall performance of the community access roads.\\n\\nGovernment should ensure that for future projects of a similar nature; The necessary loan documentation is submitted by the implementing entities and loan appraisal unit at MoFPED to the approving authorities in time, trainings activities are undertaken in a timely manner, farmers are mobilized into village savings and lending associations to increase access to funding and reviewing the e-voucher subsidy rates in order to make them more affordable to farmers. The role of other partner participating agencies (in this case UNBS) regarding quality is clearly defined in future project designs.\\n\\nIn addition, MAAIF should ensure that evaluation of business proposals for funding of ACCEs and RPOs are done in a timely manner for the farmer groups to access funds. MAAIF should also enhance supervision in the rollout districts so that works on the road chocks are completed in the remaining project life span.\\n\\n7.8. Follow up on the Value for Money Audit on the Compensation of Project Affected Persons under the Refinery Project by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development\\n\\nThe follow-up on the 2017 VFM audit on Compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) under the Refinery Project by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development found that MEMD had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations made at the time, resulting in improved RAP implementation.\\n\\nOut of the 21 key audit recommendations made in the report of 2017, 12 (57%) were fully implemented and 4 (19%) were partially implemented. The status of implementation of 5 (24%) of the recommendations can only be verified in future projects through audit of subsequent RAPs.\\n\\nSpecifically, after the 2017 audit, MEMD had registered the following progress in RAP Implementation:\\n\\n- All PAPs houses had been occupied by the respective owners;\\n- Electricity had been connected to all PAP houses;\\n- Four boreholes were constructed for use by the PAPs and the Host Community;\\n- Access roads constructed in the PAPs’ settlement area were completed and were motorable;\\n- Construction of the places of worship and a Police Post had been completed and the structures handed over to the respective authorities;\\n- Construction of the community centre and market stalls was on-going.\\n\\n126\\n\\n---\\n\\n- MEMD had acquired land titles for the land occupied by the PAPs and was processing the transfer of the individual land titles into the names of the PAPs.\\n\\nSome outstanding issues noted included the following: A few pending compensation payments mostly due to failure to trace the PAPs; failure by the contractor to remedy most defects identified during the 2017 audit; reports of conflicts owing to changing social dynamics as people adapt to living in congregated settlements; and long distance from the resettlement area to the boreholes. Finally, the PAPs also reported that MEMD and other responsible players rarely conduct visits to sensitise or update them on progress of pending outputs or to explain delays.\\n\\nFurther recommendations were then made with the aim of addressing the outstanding issues noted.\\n\\n7.9.  \\nVFM Audit on the Implementation of the Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Services Improvement Project (URMCHSIP)\\n\\nURMCHSIP is a USD 180 million project fully donor funded and was approved in August 2016 and is expected to close in December 2022. The target group comprises women of childbearing age, adolescents, and children under-five in all the one-hundred and thrty five (135) districts in Uganda. The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are to: (a) to scale up reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) services in the whole country; (b) scale-up birth and death registration (BDR) services; and (c) to strengthen disease outbreak preparedness and response.\\n\\nThe audit covered twelve (12) Districts benefiting from this project in the three financial years of 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20. Below are the key findings of the study;\\n\\n**i.**  \\nStatus of Implementation of the Project  \\nIt was noted that out of the 22 project performance indicators considered, 13 (i.e. 60%) achieved their target for the FY 2019/20. The remaining 9 indicators (i.e. 40%) were below their 2019/20 target. Amongst the 9 are two indicators: the number of health facilities constructed and equipped, which are not reflecting any progress due to delays in implementation.\\n\\n**ii.**  \\nThe Results-Based Financing (RBF) Program  \\nSince January 2019 to date, the URMCHSIP has rolled out the RBF program to 1,316 health facilities in one-hundred and thirty-five (135) districts across the country in three phases. However, review of timing of RBF payments made by the Ministry of Health-to- health facilities revealed delayed payments ranging from 83 to 154 days after the prescribed deadline. Consequently, timely implementation of Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) activities at these facilities was adversely impacted. The delayed payments were partly attributed to the delayed verification of health facility outputs by the District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) which was further constrained by the reliance on manual processes.\\n\\n127\\n\\n---\\n\\n**iii.**  \\nProcurement of Essential RMNCAH Medicines and Supplies  \\nThe project intended to support the Ministry of Health (MoH), through National Medical Stores (NMS), to procure and distribute essential Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) commodities. However, there have been several delays in the procurement of these commodities under the project, leaving health facilities partly incapable of handling certain complications arising during delivery. This was partly attributed to failure by the MoH to retender certain procurements, there being no bidder that initially met the requirements.\\n\\n**iv.**  \\nBirth and Death Notifications in Health Facilities  \\nThere were delays in implementation of various activities by National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) especially (i) scaling up the electronic vital records system for birth registration through the supply of laptops, MiFi’s and internet data bundles to 285 HC IVs and High-volume Health centre IIIs. As a result, the project has made minimal improvement in capacity of these facilities to conduct birth and death notifications.\\n\\n**v.**  \\nMonitoring and Evaluation of Project Activities  \\nThe monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function was found to be inadequate and this was partly attributed to the fact that there were no annual M&E work plans and the M&E specialist was only recruited in December 2019, two and a half years after the project had commenced.\\n\\nOverall Audit Conclusion\\n\\nThe MoH is advised to continue working closely with the National Identification and Registration Authority, the District Local Governments, National Medical Stores, and the World Bank to address any capacity gaps and implementation delays that are derailing project performance. The MoH is also advised to liaise with MoFPED and other key stakeholders to guarantee the continuity of the interventions set up under this project especially the RBF Program, the increased supply of key RMNCAH medicines and supplies, the recruitment of health workers trained under URMCHSIP, so as maintain the gains made in the Health sector as a result of this project.\\n\\n128\\n\\n---\\n\\nANNEXURES\\n\\nANNEXURE I: SUMMARY OF ENTITY FINDINGS AND OPINIONS FOR MDAs, COMMISSIONS, STATUTORY CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES AND PROJECTS\\n\\n| Sn SECTOR AND ENTITY  SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS |<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n|| AGRICULTURE SECTOR ||  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Delays in the implementation of some project activities were noted such as provision of E-Vouchers subsidies to beneficiaries in the 12 clusters, only a total of 208,827 of beneficiaries used E-Voucher out of the targeted 400,000 and only 18 road chokes have been worked on in the 7 pilot districts against the targeted 90. The project budgeted to receive UGX 361.7Bn from development partners but only received UGX 254.8Bn, representing a performance of 70% of the budget. Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX 4Bn as GOU counterpart funding but only received UGX 2.6Bn (66%) resulting in a shortfall of UGX 1.4Bn which is 34% of the budget. Out the releases of funds of UGX 254.8Bn, the project remained with unspent balance of UGX 99.1Bn representing an absorption level of 61%. I sampled 12 outputs with a total of 25 activities worth UGX.324.1Bn representing 90% of the total budget and noted that 8 outputs with 17 activities worth UGX 53.7Bn were not quantified to enable measurement of performance. Furthermore, of the 4 outputs with a total of (8) quantified activities worth UGX 80.14Bn assessed; 1 output with 1 activity representing 25% was fully implemented while 3 outputs with a total of 7 activities representing 75% were partially implemented. The budget for the financial year 2020/21 was approved on 13th August 2020 (2 months into the financial year). Project funds to the tune of UGX 3.5Bn were disbursed significantly late to the districts. National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) held only one meeting as opposed to two recommended in a year. Procurements for rehabilitation of identified and approved road chokes/work in the last 29 roll-out districts had not commenced by the time of audit despite MAAIF budgeting for the activity at UGX 90Bn. Shortcomings were observed with the E-Voucher Management Agency which included, frequent breakdown of the system, lesser enrolment of beneficiaries ie 64% of the target, only 44% of the project beneficiaries were trained in Financial Literacy and Input use, the system was at 78% of  requirement, system installation, configuration, optimisation and commissioning reports have not been submitted. its functional MAAIF budgeted UGX.104.9Bn to provide Electronic Voucher subsidies to 293,500 beneficiaries in 12 project clusters but only managed 118,933 (41%) beneficiaries. Farmers still had challenges in transacting using the system, managing farmer savings and use of inputs via the system. During the financial years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, 52,089 transactions were made by users who had never logged onto the system and were accessing inputs manually. Relatedly, 2,873 user IDs initiated 7,878 payment requests 1\\\\.

The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.4.625Bn but collected UGX.3.053Bn representing a performance of 66% of the target. There was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.11.216Bn representing 10.1%. Further, the entity remained with unspent balance of UGX.0.085Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. The entity received off-budget financing directly from development partners to a tune of UGX.49.77Bn out of which only UGX.38.19Bn was declared to the PSST and disclosed in the entity ministerial policy statement without a supplementary appropriation for the balance of UGX.11.58Bn. I sampled 8 outputs with 35 activities and expenditure of UGX.99.59Bn and noted that 7 outputs with 18 activities and expenditure worth UGX.45.070Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with 17 activities and expenditure worth UGX.54.52Bn was insufficiently quantified, of which 5 activities (29%) were quantified while 12 activities (71%) were not clearly quantified to enable measurement of performance. Further, I observed that out of the seven (7) outputs that were fully quantified, two (2) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX.5.186Bn were fully implemented while Five (5) outputs with thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.39.884Bn were partially implemented i.e. four (4) activities were fully implemented, eight (8) activities were partially implemented, while one (1) activity remained unimplemented. Submission of performance reports for all the quarters was made after the deadline dates. Fourteen (14) slow progressing competitive grant scheme (CGS) projects initiated in 2018/19 with funding of UGX.1.158Bn during the financial year 2020/2021 were still on-going despite expected completion date of June 2021. Civil works and Supplies Projects worth UGX.32,051,565,938 undertaken during the financial year were not yet handed over for use. Further, inspections of NARO facilities at institutes revealed poor road networks, broken down silos at the feed mill, non-functional water pump and abandoned works. There was failure to achieve the intended service delivery for the additional Civil Works at Rwebitaba ZARDI that costed UGX.418,584,880. This was due to lack of equipment in the laboratory. \\uf0b7 Review of 9 sample procurements worth UGX.27,606,866,233 revealed an 5 National Agricultural Research Organization 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n132\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 average delay of 45 days in the procurement process due to late release of funds by MoFPED. The entity received Covid 19 supplementary budget of UGX.0.0134Bn for settlement of arrears which was all spent by the entity representing an absorption level of 100%. It was noted that this was inadequate for settlement of domestic arrears brought forward from the previous year 2019/20 given leaving a deficit of UGX1.69Bn (98%). Domestic arrears increased from UGX.1.72Bn in the previous year to UGX.2.875Bn in the year under review, an increase of 67%. The arrears remained unsettled at the close of the year. Further, NARO did not budget for domestic arrears amounting to UGX.1.687Bn during the year as a paltry provision of only UGX.0.033Bn was budgeted to settle arrears of UGX.1.72Bn. A review of NARO’s land portfolio revealed that the entity had surveyed 31 pieces of land with total coverage of 4097.20364 Hectares, however it was noted that 8 pieces (3172.937 Hectares) were titled, 20 pieces of land (706.75454 Hectares) were at deed plan stage and 3 pieces of land (217.5121 Hectares) were still at survey report stage. Further, 17 parcels of land located in NaFIRRI-Jinja, Bulindi-Kibaale district, NaLIRRI- Tororo, Namayingo, Nyakyesasa, Ngetta- Kitgum and Rwebitaba-Fort-portal still had cases of encroachement by both private and public developers. A review of the NARO staff establishment revealed that out of the approved staff number of 995 employees, 851 positions have been filled leaving a staffing gap of 144 (14.5%) staff which indicates a further reduction in staff by about 2.5% compared to the previous financial year. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 6 | National Animal Genetics and Data Bank (NAGRIC) 2020/21 |<| \\uf0b7 The entity strategic plan had been aligned to the NDP-III at the time of audit but it was still in draft form awaiting certification from NPA before approval. |  \\n|^| Unqualified Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.1.550Bn but collected |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 UGX.3,872,073,899 representing a performance of 250% of the target.

The Project budgeted to receive IFAD funds to a tune of UGX.39.87bn, out of which UGX.25.584bn was available representing a performance of 64% of the budget. Further, there was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.0.035Bn representing 0.46% of the budgeted UGX.7.597Bn. Out of the total available funding of UGX.35.528Bn during the financial year, UGX.28.415Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.7.113Bn representing an absorption level of 80%. I sampled Six (6) outputs with a total of eighty one (81) activities and expenditure of UGX.21.6231Bn and noted that all six (6) outputs with 81 activities were fully quantified to enable assessment of performance. Further, assessment of the implementation of all Six (6) outputs revealed that; all six (6) outputs with eighty one (81) activities were partially implemented i.e. out of the eighty one (81) activities, thirty two (32) activities (40%) were fully implemented; thirty (30) activities (37.5%) were partially implemented, while nineteen (19) activities (12.5%) remained unimplemented. Two (2) contracts worth UGX.12.397Bn in relation to construction of landing sites were cancelled due to delayed implementation of projects beyond 12 months from the initial intended completion date. I noted delayed titling of 883.92 hectares of the acquired nucleus estate Land exposing it to risks of encroachment by individuals. Review of four (4) sample procurements worth UGX.1.47Bn revealed an average delay of 140 days in the procurement process majorly as a result of delayed approval process by IFAD, contracts committee and Solicitor General. 7  National Oil Palm Project 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n134\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 8 | Strengthening National Seed Certification Service Project (SNSCS). |<| \\uf0b7 Out of the planned six (6) strategic targets/goals to be achieved, none was either fully or partially achieved and one target was not even quantified to enable assessment. |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^| 2019/2020 Unqualified Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 SNSCS planned to receive and spend UGX.2.59bn from AGRA out of |  \\n|^|^|<| which UGX.1.099bn (42%) was received leading to a funding gap of |  \\n|^|^|<| UGX.1.49bn (58%).

The Project budgeted to receive UGX.1.184bn out of which UGX.1.049bn was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.135bn, which is 11% of the budget. Further, out of the total warrants of UGX.1.049Bn received during the financial year, only UGX.0.199Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.85Bn representing absorption level of 19%. I sampled five (5) outputs with 15 activities worth UGX.0.199Bn and noted that three (3) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.199Bn were fully quantified; Two (2) outputs with a total of eight (8) activities were not quantified at all. Further, of the three quantified outputs assessed, one (1) output with 3 activities worth UGX.199, 045,000 was partially implemented. Out of the 3 activities, one (1) activity was partially implemented, while two (2) activities remained unimplemented. Two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth NIL expenditure were not implemented.

Further, assessment of the implementation of the two (2) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of three (03) activities revealed that none was fully implemented. Assessment of one partially implemented output revealed that out of 3,010,000 hand hoes, only 2,500,000 hand hoes were procured and distributed to the Northern parts of the country instead of the planned vulnerable rural small holder farming households across the country. Submission of performance reports for all quarters was made after the deadline dates. Furthermore, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports. NAADS incurred huge LC charges to a tune of UGX.1.053Bn as a result of opened LCs worth UGX.71.25Bn for contracts that failed to deliver within the year. Further, I noted LCs worth UGX.23.13Bn that failed to perform for a period of more than two (2) financial years with one of UGX.2.071Bn for milk coolers outstanding for more than 4 years. Review of the Kasese industrial park Agri-LED intervention worth UGX.3.9Bn revealed allocation of land to a bus company contrary to the set objectives and delayed payment of NWSC to connect piped water. Review of the sugarcane production project implementation with investments of UGX.85Bn revealed shortcomings i.e.lack of feasibility assessment, lack of accruing benefits to the beneficiaries, weaknesses in the MoU signed with beneficiaries, limited information on members of the cooperatives, delays liquidated damages, and stalled activities. in contract completions, pending I noted failure to enter into MOU’s with beneficiaries of milk coolers contrary to the selection criteria of the standing orders of procedure for operation wealth creation. There was lack of clearly identified beneficiaries from the start in the transportation and distribution of hoes intervention, lack of MOU’s with delegated DLGs on distribution modalities and nugatory storage costs. Review of the tractor strategic intervention revealed lack of assessment of potential beneficiaries and non-adherence to the terms of the MoU thus risks of beneficiaries without the capacity to manage the tractor for 13 National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n138\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 farming practice or as an enterprise.

Out of the 43 activities with a total budget of UGX.23.561Bn, I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted that a total of three (3) activities and releases worth UGX.4.076Bn were not quantified at all to enable assessment of performance. A total of forty (40) activities and releases worth UGX.13.951Bn were fully quantified. That is, all the forty (40) activities (100%) were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance.

The Directorate procured an e-visa and permit management system during the financial year. I observed a number of contract conditions, including final user acceptance testing, completion of the setup of the system workflow, training of end-users, and integration of the system to other government systems in NIRA, CAA, URSB, and URA had not yet to be achieved.

Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.310.8Bn, only UGX.306.5Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.4.4Bn representing an absorption level of 98.6%. I sampled fourteen (14) outputs with a total of eighty seven (87) activities and expenditure of UGX.316.2Bn for assessment and noted that ten (10) outputs with a total of fifty-seven (57) activities and expenditure worth UGX.293.82Bn were fully quantified and four (4) outputs with a total of thirty (30) activities and expenditure worth UGX 22.36Bn were insufficiently quantified I noted that of the 57 quantified activities worth UGX293.82Bn assessed; 35 activities representing 61% were fully implemented, 20 activities representing 35% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 4% were not implemented. I noted that a sum of UGX. 40,6Bn was released to UPS for the settlement of Domestic Arrears to suppliers under Covid-19 related funding with all funds spent for settlement of arrears. A trend analysis of the Service’s domestic arrears over the past three years showed a decreasing trend from UGX.65.97Bn in 2018/2019 to UGX.62.345Bn in 2020/2021. I noted that UPS was only allocated UGX.40.6Bn (67.4%) for settlement of domestic arrears worth UGX.60.2Bn and paid for arrears worth UGX.54.8Bn with the additional funds worth UGX.14.2Bn diverted from planned activities to pay for the arrears An assessment of service delivery revealed cases of overcrowding in prison cells with the congestion levels increasing from 291.5% in 2017/18 to 321.1% in 2020/2021. This compromises the welfare of the inmates and may result in a number of health risks such as the quick spread of diseases and compromising on sanitation. The existing congestion has proved a challenge for the prisons’ service when implementing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It has also posed a challenge in separating different categories of offenders to break the cyclic chain of crime and violence. \\uf0b7 I noted that a total of 33 (12.7%) prisons stations are still using the bucket system of sanitation which may turn cells into a breeding centre for diseases, resulting in the violation of the prisoners’ rights \\uf0b7 I noted cases of over stay of prisoners on remand with the prisoners’ 10 The Uganda Prisons Service.  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n148\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 length of stay on remand increasing from 10.5 to 18.8 months for capital offenders and from 2.6 months to 3.8 months for petty offenders from 2016/17 to 2020/2021 respectively. For example out of the 32,409 prisoners on remand, a total of 13,933 prisoners had overstayed on remand I observed challenges of staff accommodation which currently stands at a deficit of 7,217 (65.1%) housing units with staff staying in temporary houses/shelters/not accommodated The Service also faced challenges of under staffing where out of an approved organisation structure comprising of 49,470 staff, only 12,860 (26%) posts were filled, leaving a balance of 36,610 (74%) posts vacant. This leads to high staff prisoner ratio and causes fatigue among the few staff I noted that sixty-seven (67) of the prison stations did not have buses to enable safe and secure transportation of prisoners to court which resulted into delayed delivery of prisoners to courts, transportation of high-risk inmates on open trucks, and prisoners and staff walking long distances to attend court. I noted delays in completion of the Prisoners Management Information System (PMIS) which has delayed the enjoyment of anticipated benefits from the system. I observed challenges in land management including encroachments, land disputes and encumbrances. Out of 158 pieces of land of different sizes in the different parts of the country, only 52 pieces were surveyed and titled, 17 pieces were surveyed but still not yet titled, while 89 pieces were not yet surveyed.

An assessment of the Monitoring of NGOs revealed that although the Ministry had registered 2,249 NGOs, the Ministry could only carry out offsite inspections of just 145 NGOs or 1% of all registered NGOs. A trend analysis of the Ministry domestic arrears over the past three years showed an increasing trend from UGX.0.078Bn in 2018/2019 to UGX.1.45Bn in 2020/2021.

However, the plan is yet to be approved by the Board of the Authority for implementation. NIRA budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.15.0Bn during the year. However, by the end of the year, NIRA had collected a total of UGX.3.66Bn. Out of the total GoU receipts for the financial year of UGX.55.2Bn, only UGX.53.3Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1.7Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. As a result, I noted that of the twenty-four (24) fully quantified activities worth UGX.70.6Bn assessed; 10 activities representing 42% were fully implemented, 12 activities representing 50% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 8% were not implemented at all. I assessed the extent of service delivery and noted that only 11% of the planned 1,712,880 citizens were registered during the year, while only 30% of the planned 2,000,000 National IDs were issued. I assessed the progress on registration of births and deaths and observed that NIRA registered 90% of the planned 960,000 births and only 1.3% of the 960,000 deaths. A review of the progress of registering citizens indicated that as of December 2021, 29,713,029 applications, or 69% of all Ugandans, had applied to NIRA for registration. Of these, only 25,557,448 or 86% of the applicants had been registered, and only 16,258,521 (63.6%) have been issued with National Identity cards. Only 16.3 million cards out of the over 19 million national identity cards so far printed have been claimed, leaving over 2.7 million cards unissued or unclaimed. At the time of audit (December 2021), the Authority had over 4.3 million applications yet to be processed. Of these, 3.2 million applications were still being processed, while 1.1 million applications have been rejected. NIRA plans to register at least 28,000 aliens annually and issue them with the relevant identification cards. From 2015 to date, the entity has only received 16 applications for alien IDs, and no Alien ID has been issued. A reviewed the outcome of the initiative to register learners (or school going children within their schools) undertaken in 2017/2018 to determine whether all registered learners had been issued with NINs. I noted that records of over 1.8 million (or 19%) learners’ who registered during that exercise had been rejected and thus not processed for issuance of NINs and Identification Cards. NIRA failed to procure over 4,500,000 million IDs from the Uganda Security Printing Company as the Joint Venture Agreement required.

NEC AGRO SMC LTD has an operating margin of 8.5% which is below the desirable 15%. This implies that the subsidiary has a lower proportion of revenues covering expenses rather than profits or income. The Corporation had a current ratio of 11.4 for the year under review which was way above the desirable ratio of 1.5.

However the Corporation had negative retained earnings of UGX.1,441,914,445 as at the end of the financial year which may affect the entity’s ability to meet future contingencies or investments in growth. The corporation posted a return on assets of only 0.4% down from 0.56% posted in the previous year, representing a reduction in ROA of 28.6%. This implies that the Corporation is not making enough income from the use of its assets. The Corporation had a current ratio of 2,123 for the year under review which was far above the desirable range of 1.5 – 2.0. The very high current ratio implies that the Corporation is not efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing facilities.

It was observed that UACC with the approval of the Board of Directors agreed to reallocate UGX.28,647,537,490 to fund new priorities other than those for which the funds were appropriated. A review of the ten (10) year Strategic Business and Investment Plan 2016 to 2027 revealed that out of the planned seven (7) targets/goals, one (1) had been fully achieved, three (3) were partially achieved while 14 Uganda Air Cargo Corporation, 2020/2021 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n159\\n\\n---\\n\\n| three (3) were not achieved at all. Management created an additional position of “Principal Director” to oversee the Directorates of Flight operations and Maintenance which is not in the established structure and is contrary to The Civil Aviation Regulations 2014, section 13. UACC is a statutory corporation that is supposed to undertake procurements in accordance with PPDA Law and its Regulations. I observed that procurements are normally undertaken as and when the aircrafts breakdown and as such did not follow the formal procurement procedures. UACC signed a contract on 20th April, 2021 with National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) for construction of the UACC HQ offices for a sum of UGX.1.097Bn and the expected project completion date was 19th October, 2021. I observed that unsecured advances of UGX.1.04Bn (95%) of the contract sum had been paid to NEC by closure of the financial year 30th June 2021. Audit inspection carried out on 18th October, 2021 observed that construction works were behind schedule. UACC to-date does not have an operating Aircraft to do business since most of them had been grounded or not operational under different circumstances. The Corporation had negative retained earnings/revenue reserves of UGX.24.03Bn as at the end of the financial year.

Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.2.17bn, UGX.2.11bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.5.633bn representing an absorption level of 97.4%. I assessed a sampled of 19 outputs with a total of 175 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.94Bn which were fully quantified by management. I observed that; 11 outputs with a total of 69 activities worth UGX.77.2Bn were fully implemented. 2 outputs with a total of 21 activities worth UGX.18.5Bn were partially implemented. I examined supplementary funding received by the Office for COVID 19 interventions and observed anomalies which included under absorption of the funds, failure to quantify activities implemented, inappropriate procurement methods and funds not accounted for. Specifically for management of quarantine centres, I observed that items were procured at varying prices and they were not taken on charge. Arrears totalling to UGX 30,549,780,185 remained unsettled at close of the year. Further, UGX.28,431,892,310 was provided for settlement of domestic arrears yet domestic arrears brought forward from the prior year were UGX.58,981,672,495.

The Commission collected only 0.03% of its NTR target for the year and had a shortfall in government funding of 0.04Bn which is 0.75% of the budget. The Commission absorbed all the funds that were released. Out of the five (5) out-puts assessed, one (1) output with 0.115 Bn was fully quantified, while four (4) outputs with 4.01Bn were insufficiently quantified. The one (1) output that was fully quantified was partially implemented. The Commission neither prepared annual budget monitoring plans nor submitted quarterly budget monitoring reports. The Commission also failed to submit all its quarterly budget performance reports in time. The Commission failed to coordinate the automation of revenue management systems. There are currently four (4) revenue management systems used by various Local Governments which are implemented in a disjointed and uncoordinated manner.

Similarly, the project absorbed all this money representing 100% performance. All the three (3) outputs with nine (9) activities worth UGX.38.8Bn sampled for verification were fully quantified. Out of these, two (2) outputs with fully implemented while one (1) output with four (4) activities worth UGX.12.08Bn was partially implemented. five (5) activities worth UGX.26.72Bn were The project advanced funds for the construction of coffee shops in Arua, Gulu, Lira, Mbale and Tororo. At the time of audit, works were not complete in Lira, Arua and Gulu. The coffee shop in Mbale was not fully operational. During my inspection, I noted that the beneficiary communities and districts were having sustainability challenges in maintaining project investments three (3) months after the closure of the project. These included poor maintenance of roads, low savings by farmers, among others. Ownership of two (2) project vehicles had not reverted to government three (3) months after the closure of the project. 9 Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF 3) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n168\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 10 | Project for The Restoration of Livelihoods in the Northern Region (PRELNOR) |<| The project had a shortfall of UGX.26Bn, which is 52% and UGX.3.27Bn, which is 67% of the budget in external and government funding, respectively.

There was a shortfall in NTR collection of up to 89.9% of the target, while government receipts were less than anticipated by UGX.3.64Bn. The Ministry had unspent balances of UGX.3.94Bn by year-end. I noted that out of the thirty-nine (39) outputs sampled for review, fifteen (15) (38%) were fully quantified, twenty (20) (51%) were insufficiently quantified, and four (4) (10%) were not quantified at all. Out of the fifteen (15) outputs that were fully quantified, one (1) output was fully implemented, while fourteen (14) outputs were partially implemented. All the quarterly performance reports were submitted after the deadline for submission. 2,127 motorcycles and 77,831 bicycles worth UGX.18.9Bn and UGX.24.6Bn respectively had not yet been delivered by the time of audit in November 2021, although they were due for delivery in September 2021. The Ministry delayed disbursing funds for budget support to Local Governments. UGX.22.1Bn to various Local Governments was disbursed in the last two weeks of June 2021. The Ministry delayed disbursing start-up costs of UGX.6.79Bn to 125 Local Governments. Most of the funds were transferred the last two weeks of June and, in some cases, as late as 29th June 2021. The Ministry received UGX.2.86Bn for settlement of domestic arrears as part of the COVID 19 interventions, which was all absorbed and used to settle domestic arrears. The Ministry had outstanding domestic arrears of UGX.33Bn as at June 2021. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 11 Ministry of Local Government 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n| 12 | Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA). |<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the Authority’s strategic plan had not been certified by NPA by the time of audit, contrary to the Planning Regulations. |  \\n|^| 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 The Authority received 99% of its budget from Government, and NTR |  \\n|^|^|<| performed above expectation by 21%.

Out of the four (4) outputs reviewed, only one (1) output (25%) was fully quantified. Three (3) outputs were not quantified at all. I observed that management did not prepare performance reports that show the status of implementation of planned outputs. I noted that there was slow progress of works, delayed relocation of utilities and delayed land aquistion which resulted in delayed service delivery. I also noted that UGX.1,323,171,260 that was garnished had not yet been refunded by Government through KCCA. I noted that ownership of one hundred forty-seven (147) pieces of land on which project roads and drainages had been constructed had not yet been transferred to KCCA. 13 Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (KIIDP).  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 1. | PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SECTOR |<| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Out of the planned 10 strategic targets/goals, 4 targets were fully achieved, 5 targets were partially achieved and 1 was not achieved at all.

Out of 6 activities planned, only 2 were fully implemented (33%) while 1 activity was partially implemented (17%) and 3 activities were actually not implemented (50%). Funds to the tune of £ 890 (UGX.3,739,406) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The entity did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. A review of the cumulative performance reports revealed the subsequent quarterly performance reports did not include activities implemented in the previous quarter(s) and therefore, the cumulative activities reported in the fourth quarter performance report does not include all activities implemented in the first, second and third quarters.

Out of the planned 7 strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, 2 outputs/targets had been fully achieved while 5 were partially achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.2.56Bn representing 17.3% performance. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.7.624Bn, UGX.9.11Bn was spent by the entity resulting into an over absorption of UGX.1.48Bn representing an absorption level of 119%. I sampled 5 outputs with a total of 30 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.7.07Bn and observed that 4 outputs with a total of 18 activities and expenditure worth UGX.6.69Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with a total of 12 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.39Bn was insufficiently quantified. For the 5 fully quantified outputs, 2 outputs with 2 activities worth UGX.2.55Bn were fully implemented while 3 outputs with 28 activities worth UGX.4.09Bn were partially implemented. Funds to the tune of USD.17,382.29 (equivalent to UGX.64,841,678) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 after the deadline given for submission. I noted some cases of material inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the level of performance reported. UGX.328,779,539 reported as cash in transit has been in the books of the Embassy for more than three financial years and the funds have never been credited to the Consolidated Fund. The Mission had total collections including balance brought forward from previous year of UGX.884,552,695out of which UGX.180,503,771 had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.704,048,924 not remitted.

USD.18,000 (equivalent to UGX.69,552,175) was paid to Embassy staff as Covid relief allowance during the financial year 2019/2020 in the last month of the financial year. This allowance is not provided for in the Public Service Standing Orders and neither was it budgeted for during the year. JPY.2,591,132 (equivalent to UGX.89,938,192) out of which 2/3 of the amount should have been recovered from the respective staff was incurred on the payments for telephone bills during the period. The recovery was not effected. The fixed assets register maintained by the entity was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions and lacked details of: cost of some items, maintenance cost, estimated useful life, among others and assets which had already been disposed were still in the assets register. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 33\\\\.

Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.4.16Bn, UGX.3.81Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.35Bn representing an absorption level of 91.5%. I sampled 5 outputs with a total of 9 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.76Bn and observed that 3 outputs with a total of 7 activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.76Bn were fully quantified while 2 outputs with a total of 2 activities were not quantified.

The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was not returned to the consolidated fund account by the 31st July 2020 contrary to the law.\\n\\n- Out of the 5 outputs with a total of 9 activities and expenditure of UGX.5.152Bn, 2 outputs with a total of 2 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.467bn were fully quantified, 2 outputs with a total of 5 activities and expenditure worth UGX.4.828Bn were insufficiently quantified while 1 output with a total of 2 activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.372Bn was not quantified at all. Of the quantified outputs, 1 output with 1 activity worth UGX.0.167bn was fully implemented while 1 output with 1 activity worth UGX.0.300bn was partially implemented.\\n\\n- The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. In addition, performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 were submitted after the deadline for submission.\\n\\n- I observed that the Head of Mission and the Accounting Officer were absent from the station from March 2020 to June 2020, a period that is critical for preparation and finalisation of the Embassy financial statements. The two officers were under lock-down restrictions in Uganda due to onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition the Finance Attaché was not in office for most of the financial year. This negatively impacted on the operations of the Mission during that period.\\n\\n- During the month of June 2020, a sum of DKK.152,700 (equivalent to UGX.85,970,100) was paid to Embassy staff for claims for trips that had been undertaken in January and February 2020.

Out of the total warrants of UGX.671.61Bn received during the financial year, UGX.649.15Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.21.906Bn representing absorption level of 96.1%. Out of the 9 outputs with a total of 40 activities and expenditure of UGX.671.61Bn assessed, 4 outputs with a total of 10 activities and expenditure worth UGX.51.838Bn was fully quantified, 3 outputs with a total of 16 activities and expenditure worth UGX.499.639Bn were insufficiently quantified while 2 outputs with a total of 14 activities and expenditure worth UGX.97.675Bn were not quantified at all.

I noted inconsistencies in the reported performance where all vehicles were reported as received which was not true while reported balances in the financial statements were inconsistent with those reported in the performance reports. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.4,023,217,397 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I noted that the Commission has been accumulating arrears in past three years and during the year 2020/2021, UGX.6.959Bn in arrears remained outstanding. The Commission has in the past won cases and was awarded costs to the tune of UGX.336,880,920 but management has not collected these receivables. The Commission procured Biometric Voter Verification Kit and services for the 2021 general election at a cost of UGX.82,894,881,252 and I observed that available kits were not considered while the services were not fully delivered. The Commission entered into two contract agreements with a company to supply 10 double cabin pick-up vehicles at a cost of UGX.1,564,563,350 and 40 double cabin pick-up vehicles at UGX.7,013,387,920 for nomination of the Presidential candidates but by the time of audit, whereas the Commission had paid the full amount, only 32 double cabin vehicles out of the total 50 vehicles procured had been delivered leaving a balance of 18 vehicles. The Commission procured for printing of ballot papers for 2021 general elections at a total cost of UGX.83.855Bn. 248 out of expected 448 pallets were delivered but the Commission had assembled vehicles to carry the entire load which rendered the vehicles redundant and this caused a loss to the Commission in form of hire fees, fuel and allowances. The Commission was required to vacate their current premises by 30th June, 2021 and was subsequently compensated with UGX.22.14Bn by the Uganda National Roads Authority which was transferred to the consolidated fund as non-tax revenue. As a result of the continued delay to implement this critical activity of finding a new home, the Commission is already incurring losses on property acquired and is also likely to cause government to incur litigation costs through UNRA’s failure to completely hand over the construction sites for roads to the contractor. The Commission contracted two law firms for provision of legal services for Presidential petition at a cost of UGX.3,748,550,000 which had been budgeted at UGX.800Million resulting into payment of UGX.2,948,550,000 over and above the budget. Even though the planning for the elections started 3 years back, the procurement was treated as an emergency and there was no basis for the fees charged or detail of how the Commission came up with the market price for the service. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n|| WORKS AND TRANSPORT SECTOR ||  \\n|^|^||  \\n\\n\\n200\\n\\n---\\n\\n| I noted that the entity had prepared a strategic plan. However, this had not been approved by NPA at the end of the year under review. The Ministry did not forecast the NTR to be collected during the year. However, a total of UGX6,995,230,920 was collected during the year. Out of the total warrants of UGX. 1,280.322Bn received during the financial year, UGX. 1,067.967Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 212.355Bn representing absorption level of 83.4% The Ministry did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: bridge inventory Data for BMS not collected; bridge management System (BMS) Software not procured, and; upgrading to Bitumen Standard Sebbowa road. The Ministry had receivables worth UGX.1,570,776,843 out of which those worth UGX.623,855,947 were outstanding at the end of the previous year. There is likelihood of failure to recover the receivables that have been outstanding for over a year Twenty-one (21) units of district road equipment had been lying in the workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair. The equipment included: thirteen (13) motor graders of different models; four (4) bulldozers; One (1) pickup; two (2) dump trucks, and one (1) wheel loader. Three (3) out of the nine (9) training aircrafts of the East African Civil Aviation Academy in Soroti were grounded due to non-repair and maintenance. The aircrafts were (registration numbers): 5X-RWE grounded due to a defective fuel injector pump; 5X-UAN grounded for mandatory structural modification and 5X -YKM grounded for a propeller overhaul. I observed delayed compensation of PAPs for the development of the New Kampala Port in Bukasa. The valuation report for 2,378 PAPs with a total compensation sum of UGX 29.2 billion was approved by the Chief Government Valuer in October 2018. A total of 1,253 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.19.5 billion had been paid by 30th June 2021. As a result a total of 1,125 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.9.7 billion have remained unpaid for about three years. Procurements worth UGX 1,772,908,757 which were not planned were implemented procurements worth UGX.7,465,000,000 which were planned were not implemented. by the Ministry, while \\\\- Bbira I observed delayed completion of Kayunga - Nabuganyi and Nansana – Kireka  roads construction project contracted at UGX 45,349,361,632. The contract provided that the works were to be completed by 01/07/2020. However, by the time of the audit in October 2021, one year and four months after planned completion date, the project works were not yet completed. The acquisition of land for the Right of Way (RoW) for the SGR project has been delayed. The project plan was to acquire 5200 acres of land free of encumbrances at an estimated cost of UGX 534,600,000,000 for the construction of Kampala – Malaba SGR route by October 2016. However, only 1,295.98 (24.9%) acres of land had been acquired at a cost of UGX.95,361,767,388 (18%) as of September 2021. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) Unqualified 1 Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 2 | Report on Verification SGS Automotive Uganda Limited For |<| \\uf0b7 I was unable to obtain all documents relating to the procurement for my review.

Out of the total warrants of UGX. 506.507bn received during the financial year, UGX. 506.296 Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.211Bn representing an absorption level of 99.96%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA The Authority did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Production of quarterly reports on the status and functionality of District Road Committees; Recruitment and substantive appointment of staff and; Review and calibration of the funds allocation formula. The Fund did not collect the funds provided for under section 21 of the URF Act 2008 which mandates the Fund on recommendation by the URF Board to charge road user charges which include fuel levies, international transit fees from vehicles entering the country, road license fees, axle load fees, and bridge and road toll fees. I noted that the fund allocation formula was last reviewed by the Secretariat in 2019. In addition, during the year, the formula was not reviewed to provide for current situations such as budget cuts and Covid- 19 pandemic effects which led to disproportionate transfers to designated agencies. Procurements worth UGX 642,234,236 had delays ranging between 1 and 93 working days. For example; the contract for provision of Motor Vehicle maintenance services under framework contract was delayed by 93 days and the contract for supply, delivery and installation of I-pads for URF Board members was delayed by 15 days.

However, UNRA collected a |  \\n|^|^|<| total of UGX3,894,306,295 during the year. I also noted that MoFPED set |  \\n|^|^|<| a target of UGX10.76bn to be collected in NTR by UNRA during the year |  \\n|^|^|<| under review; there was no reconciliation between the Ministry of |  \\n|^|^|<| Finance, Planning and Economic and Uganda National Roads Authority on |  \\n|^|^|<| the planned revenue to be collected. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 The UNRA budgeted to receive UGX. 3,918.151 bn out of which UGX. |  \\n|^|^|<| 3,787.289 bn was availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX 130.863 bn, |  \\n|^|^|<| which is 3.34% of the budget. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that UNRA did not have unit cost estimates at activity level to |  \\n|^|^|<| provide a link between inputs, processes, outputs and intermediate |  \\n|^|^|<| outcomes realized during the year. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 The Authority failed to implement several planned activities during the |  \\n|^|^|<| year. Examples include: construction of 10 km - equivalents along |  \\n|^|^|<| package 6 (Karugutu - Ntoroko and Kabwoya - Buhuka); construction of |  \\n|^|^|<| 10 km - equivalents along Rwenkunye- Apac- Lira-Acholibur road; civil |  \\n|^|^|<| works for the construction of UNRA offices; works for construction of |  \\n|^|^|<| Kamdini Weigh station, and; construction of Wanseko Ferry landing site. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 Contrary to the Land Acquisition Act CAP 226, I noted that for the Hoima- |  \\n|^|^|<| Butiaba-Wanseko Road Project, UNRA did not submit a request to the |  \\n|^|^|<| Ministry of Lands to declare the land identified for the road project as |  \\n|^|^|<| land of interest. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 I observed delays in payments for Project Affected Persons on two roads |  \\n|^|^|<| audited.

It was noted by the time of the |  \\n|^|^|<| audit that 13 resettlement sites had been identified and these were being |  \\n|^|^|<| assessed for suitability. However, although the process of engaging a |  \\n|^|^|<| provider to support UNRA in developing housing options and building the |  \\n\\n\\n203\\n\\n---\\n\\n||<|<| agreed resettlement houses was initially scheduled to be completed by |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<| December 2020, no contractor had been procured for this purpose by the |  \\n|^|<|<| time of the audit in September 2021, implying a delay of over 9 months. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Significant delays in subdivision, demarcation and transfer of titles for |  \\n|^|<|<| fully acquired plots were observed on the Kampala-Jinja Expressway and |  \\n|^|<|<| Hoima-Wanseko Road projects. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The Authority had an outstanding balance of UGX 215,059,225,419 in |  \\n|^|<|<| terms of payables at the year end.

Out of this, only UGX 114.991bn was collected, representing a performance of 39.2% of the target. UCAA absorbed all its revenue collected, and accrued expenditure in unpaid bills that is. its actual expenditure was more than the revenue. The Authority did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Capital projects for Regional Airports, KOICA Counterpart funding, and procurement of a fleet management system, updating the master plan and constructing the ground surface car park. There was an increase in trade and other receivables of UGX. 12,279,645,000 (equivalent to 25%) from UGX. 48,854,526,000 to UGX.61,134,171,000.

Along with the lack of potential to cover loan interest, the Authority had a significant long term liabilities portfolio on its balance sheet, which majorly comprised of the loan from Exim Bank of China. Prime Media’s contract ended with a debt of UGX 1,131,017,128 which was unpaid for the year before the expiry of the contract. UCAA has multiple systems operating in different departments which are tailored for the operations in the respective departments. A review of these systems revealed that some were not functional, not interfaced with other complementary system(s) and/or some of their modules were not working. Further, the IT Point of Sale System bought for tracking of revenue from concessionaire shops was out of date. The Exim Bank loan terms to UCAA were renegotiated and this was to be formalized into an addendum agreement, to ensure that they are manageable. However, the addendum to the contract terms had still not been made by the time of this audit. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 6 | Uganda National Airlines Company Ltd (UNACL). 2020/21 Qualified Opinion |<| \\uf0b7 UGX 8,716,398,000 was disclosed as the value of the inventories in the statement of financial position.

Out of this loan amount, loans totalling UGX.16,511,595,000 (other than the Spanish Government loan) were not supported and did not show any movement over the last four (4) years. equipment loans amounting Interest arising from loans that was yet to be cleared by URC amounted to UGX.9,511,880,000. However, this balance has been outstanding over several years without any movement. The status quo still remained the same by the close of the year under review. This interest payable was not supported by any original documentation. Trade and Other Payables increased from UGX.17,937,602,000 at the beginning of the year to UGX.21,513,931,000 at the close of the year. Out of the amount, trade and other payables worth UGX.9,753,781,407 lacked supporting documents such as LPOs, contracts, inward invoices, claims and demand notes. The Corporation had Trade and Other  of UGX.75,637,890,000 as at 30th June 2021. The figure includes UGX.69,516,000,000 due from Government in respect of the Nsambya land. This amount has remained un-paid to URC for too long despite Government having disposed of the land to the public long ago implying that the Corporation may never be compensated for its land. Receivables URC budgeted to collect internal revenue of UGX 120.49 during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX 54.6bn was collected, representing a performance of 45.3% of the target. The Corporation did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Sleeper reconditioning; Kampala Station not fencing; Tororo Station Roof Repairs and; Rehabilitation of Steel Mill Jinja siding.

The Corporation’s losses and the ratios computed are an indication that Uganda Railways Corporation is not performing well in terms of profitability and ability to sustain provision of services without further Government intervention for funding and Management strategies to improve revenue generation. Management did not assess impairment of assets despite existence of impairment indicators. For instance, rental properties were being charged below market value.

Despite the non-compliance at the preliminary stage, the bid was evaluated at the Technical stage without following procurement regulations. Government signed an agreement with Mango Tree (U) Ltd for the rehabilitation and upgrade of the Pamba ferry. However, the vessel was still grounded after a year of signing the agreement. An officer of URC irregularly signed to transfer land measuring 4.452 hectares in Lira (under FRV 220 Folio 13). The land was subdivided into plots 41-63, 52-62, 42-50 and the titles were being processed.

Successive revisions of completion dates extended the construction period by a further 22 months with the last revised completion date being 27th March 2021. A certificate of substantial completion was issued in January 2021, and the contractor allowed 12 months as the Defects Liability Period, expiring on 27th January 2022. The snag list included two main items; the construction of Hoima Town Roads and a way bridge. I observed delayed completion of civil works on Upgrading of Kigumba – Bulima Road (Lot1). The construction period was for 30 months (after commencement in March 2018), elapsing on 31st August 2020. When the Audit Team visited the site in September 2021, (42 months after commencement), the attained level of completion was approximately 95%. However, the new proposed completion date of 31st August had passed and no new completion date had been communicated. There were delays in payment of lot1 supervision fees. By the time of my audit, the Lot 1 Supervising Engineer’s unpaid invoices had accumulated to Euros 661,605 for the foreign component of the contract and UGX 1.38bn for the local component. The delays are likely to impact on the Engineer’s ability to perform the contractual obligations and in turn impact on the progress of the construction works. 11  Road Sector Support Project 4 – Kigumba-Masindi- Hoima-Kabwoya Road (2021) (Uganda National Roads Authority).  2021 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 12 | Albertine Regional Sustainable Development Project (ARSDP) (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2021 Unqualified Opinion |<| \\uf0b7 I observed delayed implementation of civil works (Upgrading of Kyenjojo- Kabwoya Raod – 100km).

However, 91% of the original project implementation time had elapsed as at 30th June 2020. Civil works for the upgrade of Bumbobi-Lwakhakha 44.5km road had attained 84% physical progress as at 30th June 2020 versus time progress and planned physical progress of 91%. The financial progress stood at 83% against plan of 92% as at 30th June 2020. For the upgrade of Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu (78.5km), 19.24% cumulative physical progress had been achieved as at 30th June 2020 although 33.4% was planned to be completed. During the FY 2019/20, UGX 3,033,479,790 (28%) of GOU counterpart project funds were re-allocated to other Projects. Re-allocation of Project funds to other projects invalidates the approved plan for implementation of RSSP-V activities. UGX 267,083,716 was paid as interest on delayed payments. Such costs are un-necessary and represent unbudgeted expenditures which affect funds ear-marked for implementation of planned Project activities.

The total interest paid for the delayed settlement of the IPCs amounted to UGX 539,889,266. These interest payments could have been higher if the dollar amounts had not been negotiated downwards by USD 108,262.29 due to disagreements in computations.

Revenue shortfall limits the implementation of planned activities which could affect the achievement of the project objectives. Review of the Q4 Progress report revealed that many sub-projects worth USD 27.5million handed over to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development for construction, will not be implemented due to lack of funding, yet, costs have already been incurred since all the sub- projects have been designed and Environment and Social Impact Assessment done. The civil works for construction of three markets, namely: Biiso Market in Buliisa District, Kabaale Market in Hoima District and Buhuka Market in Kikuube District costed at UGX.9,963,228,048 were not complete despite the extension of the completion date to 31st August 2021, thus delaying service delivery to citizens. 4 Albertine Region Sustainable Development Project (ARSDP) – MoLHUD 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 5 | Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) Component |<| \\uf0b7 It was noted that out of the UGX.12.73Bn budget allocated for the project activities during the fiscal year 2020/2021, UGX.11.86 Bn (93%) was spent, leaving a balance of UGX.0.87Bn. |  \\n|^| 1- Land Administration  (IDA CREDIT AGREEMENT CR 52690-UG) PROJECT ID P130471.  2020/21 Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that one plot of land has multiple titles while others are plotted in |  \\n|^|^|<| the middle of the road and wetlands.

A sum of UGX.1,237,717,474 was paid for outstanding arrears that related to the prior year, but were not recognized in the prior year financial statements as payables. In addition, withholding tax of UGX.22,020,000 was not deducted and paid to URA. I noted that the court garnished the Commission’s bank Account with a balance of UGX.244,184,480 leading to the delay to clear the outstanding obligations to third parties. It was noted that the entity obtained a supplementary of UGX 10.62Bn was received by the entity but was not requisitioned by management. There were unsupported payments of domestic arrears amounting to UGX 14.4 Bn. Payments worth UGX 6.7Bn were paid to unverified arrears. In addition, payables to Church of Uganda amounting to UGX 15Bn, and Receivables amounting to UGX 3.966 Bn relating to the overpayment to Kampala archdiocese in the prior year were not recognised. In addition, outstanding arrears of UGX 1.2Bn related to prior year but paid during the year have not been recognised in the current year. The Commission does not have a land inventory and database for all government land and properties under its jurisdiction that are either occupied by tenants, vacant, acquired under compensation (but not yet re-distributed to the bona fide occupants), or acquired and owned by other government institutions and missions abroad.

The action overrides the Government financial management controls and distorts the monetary policy. UGX.9.6Bn was advanced to staff through their bank accounts to purchase goods, services, and other activities without following regulations. The practice is irregular and also exposes Government funds to a risk loss through misuse. UGX.1.16Bn paid through mobile money to various suppliers for the provision of services were not adequately supported with accountability documents as required; as a result, I could not ascertain whether the funds were utilised correctly for the intended activities. Management made cash withdrawals amounting to UGX.5.2Bn during the year, contrary to Section 11 of PFMA 2015, as well as Section 7 of the URA Cash Policy that sets the maximum insurable cash limit to UGX.20Mn. The practice has been recurring and exposes government funds to a risk of misuse of cash and loss.

This was contrary to Section 23(1) of the PFMA 2015. Planned procurements worth UGX.25.1Bn were not implemented by 30th June 2021. This adversely affects the realisation of critical government programs. Management explained that the delays were due to various reasons, some of which are beyond their control. During the financial year 2020/21, the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP) registered only 167,211 taxpayers against a target of 436,869 taxpayers representing a 38.27% registration success and a shortfall of 61.7%. In revenue terms, although TREP had a revenue target of UGX.124.58 Bn in FY 2020/21, it had only collected UGX.49.93Bn by 30th June 2021, representing a 40% performance rate. The paltry performance was attributed to COVID-19 effects, riots and the political environment, that hindered field activities. The Ministry of Local Government had planned to implement activities worth UGX.4.4Bn under TREP activities but only implemented activities worth UGX.3.3Bn, leaving un-implemented activities worth UGX.1.1Bn despite receiving all funding. As a result, the e-LogRev objective of simplifying and strengthening the local revenue collection systems for Local Governments may not be achieved in time. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 4 | URA Revenue Collection Account  2020/21 |<| The Authority had a total revenue collection target of UGX.22.039Tn for the financial year 2020/21, and collected total gross revenue of UGX.19.649Tn, representing 89% hence a shortfall of UGX.2.39Tn \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|^|<| (11%).

This performance was similar |  \\n|^|^|<| to last year\\'s performance. This implies that tax bases have not widened |  \\n|^|^|<| or deepened enough to tax all potential sources. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 There was an increase in total Tax Arrears from UGX.3.009Tn in 2019/20 |  \\n|^|^|<| to UGX.4.519Tn in the financial year 2020/21 representing a total |  \\n|^|^|<| increase of UGX.1.492Tn or percentage increase in total Tax Arrears of |  \\n|^|^|<| 50%. The Increase denies Government the required resources to deliver |  \\n|^|^|<| more services. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 The contract between the Government of Uganda (GoU) and a private |  \\n|^|^|<| company had since expired even though the Company had continued to |  \\n|^|^|<| manufacture motor vehicle registration numbers for taxpayers.

However, only UGX.11.25Bn was available for spending resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.1Bn, which is 9% of the budget; this affected implementation of planned activities. Assessment of implementation of planned outputs revealed that Nine (9) outputs with a total of forty (40) activities worth UGX.2.89Bn were partially implemented. Out of the forty (40) activities, the entity implemented twenty-eight (28) activities (70%), while twelve (12) activities  In addition, planned procurements totaling UGX.309Mn were also not implemented. (30%) remained unimplemented. Out of the approved staffing level of 61, the Authority has only 36 positions filled (59%), leaving a staffing gap of 25 positions (41%). Included in the unfilled positions are key positions of Director Finance and Accounting, Director Human Resource and Administration and the Director Research and Strategy. This affects the entity’s capacity to effectively deliver its mandate. 5 Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 6 | Bank of Uganda 2020 |<| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Uncertainties brought by Covid-19 could potentially led to delays by Government to refund/repay amounts due to the Bank.

However, as at 31 December 2020, only 331 customers with loans worth UGX. 58.0 billion were still under repayment moratoriums with the rest having reverted to periodic repayments schedules following the initial restructures. The COVID-19 pandemic containment measures increased economic uncertainty amongst the borrowers, prompting many to prematurely repay their loans during and after the lockdowns.

The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2019/20) was UGX.40.49Trillion, which would have translated into UGX.202.43Bn funding for the Contingencies’ Fund in the year under review. I noted however, that Parliament only appropriated UGX.62Bn to the Contingencies fund, causing a deficit of UGX.140.3Bn. Underfunding of the Contingencies Fund distorts implementation of the approved budget for the current year as evidenced by budget cuts and reallocations to fund supplementary budgets relating to natural disasters and emergencies that occurred during the year. Audit of the withdrawals made off the Contingencies Fund revealed that a total of UGX.62,070,000,000 was transferred to the Fund bank account held at Bank of Uganda. The funds were consequently transferred to entity bank accounts and expensed off the IFMS, which makes it difficult to follow up and track to confirm the adherence to the approved budget guidelines and also confirm accuracy of the reports generated. Spending off the IFMS also exposes the funds to the risk of misuse due to lack of transparency. 9 Contigencies’ Fund. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 10 | Financial  Intelligence Authority.  2020/21 |<| \\uf0b7 The Financial Intelligence Authority lacked an approved strategic plan aligned to the NDP III.

I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up on the approval of the strategic plan urgently. A review of the staffing structure for FIA revealed that out of the total |  \\n|^| Unqualified |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| approved establishment of 64 staff, only 41 (64%) positions were filled, |  \\n|^|^|<| and 23 (36%) positions had not yet been filled.

I however noted that a total of UGX.4.9Bn was collected based on basis of computed returns submitted by the Insurers and Health Member Organisations (HMO’s), with no evidence of reconciliation of Training Levy returns, contrary to requirements under the Act. As a result, the returns may be understated to reduce remittances, which may lead to revenue loss. 11 Insurance Training College (ITC).  2020/21 \\uf0b7 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 12 | National Population Council. |<| \\uf0b7 Out of the ten (10) sampled outputs that NPC planned to implement |  \\n|| Opinion |<| during the period under review, five (5) outputs representing 50% of the planned sampled outputs were fully implemented, four (4) Outputs representing 40% were partially implemented, and one (1) Output |  \\n|^| Unqualified |<| representing 10% was not implemented during the period under review. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 Gratuity payments totalling UGX.940Mn were not subjected to PAYE and |  \\n|^|^|<| the 5% NSSF employee deductions.

A review of the cases filed at the Tribunal, in the last three years, revealed that there was an increase of cases filed from 40 in 2017 to 176 in 2020. In spite of the increase in cases, there has been no increase in the number of members of the Tribunal which has necessitated that the members of the Tribunal sit every day not withstanding their regular involvement in the administrative aspects of the Tribunal. The current structure of the remuneration of the members indicates that each member will be paid a sitting allowance and a retainer. This has resulted into the Tribunal spending the bulk of its money on the payment of allowances to the Tribunal members. During the reviews, I noted that there were instances in which a Tribunal member is an active partner of a Firm that has a case before the Tribunal. Whereas the said Tribunal Member does not form part of the panel of the committee adjudicating the disputes, this presents a potential conflict of interest for the members of the committee who work with him and have to decide the matters involving his Firm for which he is an active partner. I noted that the approved organisation structure for the Tribunal, did not have a provision for internal audit function and indeed, this role has not been assigned to any staff. This is contravention with the PFMA 2015, and it also denies the Tribunal an early warning mechanism in cases of errors of omission or commission. 13 Tax Appeals Tribunal. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 14 | Microfinance Authority Uganda Regulatory (UMRA) 2020/21 |<| It was noted that, contrary to Section 17 of the PFMA 2015, the Authority had unspent funds totalling UGX.4.93Mn at the year-end that were never returned to Treasury.

I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2,572,820,000 during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.1,410,970,500 was collected, representing a performance of 55% of the target, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1,161,849,500. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.2.572Bn during the period, out of which UGX.1.383Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.189Bn which is 46.23% of the budget. I observed that in cases where outputs were not quantified, management reported performance in generic ways such as tenants sensitised to pay rent, court attended etc, without specifying the number/quantities achieved. All five (5) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.1.383Bn were partially implemented. I noted that in a twist of events, the Board refunded the sum of UGX.0.860Bn that had been deposited in respect of the property, citing the fact that the property had been donated to the tenant, but this was not supported by a Board resolution. I observed that according to a disclosure in note 19 of the accounts, receivables have increased from UGX.3.35Bn last year to UGX.8.21Bn this year. Of this amount, UGX.3,73Bn relates to uncollected rent from prior years and UGX.4.60Bn relates to unpaid proceeds from property sales. I reviewed the portfolio of DAPCB court cases and noted that there was a continuous rise) in the number of court cases against the Board arising from disputes of properties.

Out of this, a total of UGX.1,875,073,520 was collected, representing a performance of 156% of the target with an excess collection of UGX.673,564,297. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.53.4Bn from GoU sources; however, only UGX.49.45Bn was released, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.95Bn, which is 7.4% of the budget.

In this regard, the concession is only being enjoyed by two firms which creates competitive disadvantages to the other players in the industry. there was no mechanism in place to monitor compliance with the set targets despite having reached the first milestone. the memorandum of understanding signed did not provide for reporting obligations for the beneficiaries. There was thus no justification for the continued incentive all refunds effected so far are made from supplementary budgets implying none sustainability of the incentive. Indeed a total of UGX.5.41Bn remains outstanding as at 30th June 2021. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 In line with the above, it is apparent that the subsidy is being implemented with irregularities. Government is exposed to continued expenditure without due regard to achievement of the intended objectives. The Uganda Agriculture Insurance Scheme (UAIS) is a Public Private Partnership between GoU and the Private Sector represented by the Uganda Insurers Association and insurance companies under the agro- Consortium. The purpose of the scheme is to hedge Ugandan farmers against natural calamities beyond their control. However, review of implementation revealed that there was lack of a mutual agreement on Marketing of the scheme to the potential beneficiaries and a number of conditions in the MoU are not yet fulfilled. This has limited its access to potential beneficiaries and also raised transparency concerns in regard to how the current beneficiaries were identified. The PPP Act 2015 provides that there is to be established a Project Development Fund to support public private partnerships initiatives. However, six years later, there is no evidence of operationalization of the Fund by the Minister. Failure to establish the fund may be a contributory factor to the slow uptake and limited feasibility studies of the Public Private Partnerships. previous financial year. I also noted that arrears relating to unsettled obligations to international organizations stood at UGX.49.49Bn with some dating as far back as financial year 2014/15. \\uf0b7 GoU, through MOFPED, offered additional incentives of USD Cents 5/KWH to companies in the Cotton, Textile and Apparels (CTA) industry.

These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government. During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery.

This is an indication of unrealistic budgeting by the Corporation well aware of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic Comparison of the trade receivables balances for current year and prior year indicates that the receivables decreased by 28% from UGX.30.79Bn to UGX.22Bn. An ageing analysis revealed that receivables worth UGX.13.549Bn from 228 clients were at least 7 years old without any movements in their ledger accounts, thus casting doubt as to their existence and recoverability. 5 Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n230\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 The Corporation has outstanding NSSF amounting to UGX.46.38Bn as at 30th June 2021.

It was observed that the term of office for the previous Board expired on 5th October 2019, and no replacement Board had been appointed by the time of issuance of my report. This is likely to affect the strategic direction of the entity. For example, I noted that at the time of the audit (June 2021), the entity’s strategic plan was in draft form and was not approved due to the lack of a Board. \\uf0b7 I noted that contracts worth UGX.192Mn were awarded to bidders who 2 Uganda Export Promotions Board  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n232\\n\\n---\\n\\n| did not submit the required documents to evidence the eligibility and administrative compliance as required by regulations and bid documents at the preliminary stage. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 3 | Uganda Freezones Authority (UFZA)  2020/21 |<| Contrary to Section 15 of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, the Authority overspent to the tune of UGX.635Mn on recruitment and personnel costs in excess of what was approved by the Board.

Failure to budget for NTR conceals the entity’s potential collect revenue and also complicates assessment of performance since there is no benchmark. I noted that out of the budgeted revenue of UGX. 8.899Bn from the Central Government for 2020/2021, and only UGX. 8.035Bn was received, representing a performance of only 90 % of the release. The entity had a cash balance brought forward of UGX.134,172,095 from FY 2019/2020 and received UGX.8,035,212,980 making total cash available for spending in FY 20/21 of UGX.8,169,385,075. Out of the total cash available to spend, only UGX.3,730,897,866 was actually spent by the entity, representing an absorption level of 46%. This resulted into a balance of UGX.4,438,487,209 (54%) as unspent funds. I compared the consolidated procurement plan, monthly procurement reports and procurement files availed and established that a number of procurements worth UGX.2,621,000,000 were not completed as of 30th June 2021. Failure to implement planned activities despite availability of funds. I noted that the Board sat only once during the year under review on 16th September 2020.

As a result, the Buereau was unable to claim for a total of UGX.13Bn charged on goods and services for conformity stamps issued by the provider towards conformity enforcement. There is a risk of misuse of the amounts involced by the private provider. The Bureau released 366 consignments without testing due to lack of capacity and another 633 consignments released due to the absence of standards to test these commodities for conformity. Lack of capacity may lead to the release of sub-standard products to the market. I noted that out of the approved staff structure of 666 positions, the Bureau had only filled 439, leaving a staffing gap of 227 (34 %). As a result, there was staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. There is a risk of sub-standard goods entering the country through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present. It was noted that procurements to the tune of UGX.2.735Bn were not completed as of 30th June 2021. This was attributed to several reasons, including failure to attract competitive bidders for some procruements, delayed submission of clear specifications, especially for specialised equipment, late submissions/ initiations of procurement requisitions by the users, as well as delayed deliveries due to COVID-19 especially for specialised Equipment. Un implemented activities imply that the provision of critical government programs and associated services were delayed. 8 Uganda National Bureau of Standards.  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n235\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 9 | Uganda  Corporation (UDC). 2020/21 Development |<| Out of the total funds received of UGX.137.27Bn only UGX.63.39Bn was spent by the entity during the year, resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.73.88Bn representing an absorption level of only 46%.

However, 5 years |  \\n|^|^|<| later, the company has never been capitalised to that tune; currently the |  \\n|^|^|<| capitalisation grants have accumulated to UGX.311Bn and the Industrial |  \\n|^|^|<| and Economic Development Fund has never been operationalized. The |  \\n|^|^|<| current funding model, is such that capitalisation grants over the years |  \\n|^|^|<| come assigned to specific projects which nullifies the investment appraisal |  \\n|^|^|<| process of UDC.

These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage 10  Investment  \\uf0b7 Uganda Authority. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n236\\n\\n---\\n\\n| management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| TOURISM SECTOR |<| \\uf0b7 |  \\n| Management failed to collect tuition fees and accumulated receivables to the tune of UGX.460Mn by close of the financial year, with some debts dating as far back as 2014. I observed that some students who had not cleared fees had completed their studies, graduated and even obtained their certificates rendering such receivables uncollectible. I noted that the entity had prepared a new strategic plan, but had no proof of certification and approval of its plan by NPA. Management explained that the exercise was interrupted by Covid-19 Lock down and closure of schools. Out of 175 approved posts for the Institute, only 127 were filled, resulting into a staffing gap of forty-eight (48) positions. Furthermore, seven (7) positions were filled by staff in an acting capacity including the Position of the Principal.

The entity budgeted to receive UGX.6.24Bn from donors, however, UGX.5.74Bn was realized, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.501Mn (8%) of the budget. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.0.72Bn, out of which UGX.0.762Bn was received, resulting into an excess receipt of UGX.0.042Bn, representing 5.8% of the budget I noted that Management re-assessed its revenue performance and requested the Board to approve a contingency plan to limit the expenditure of the Authority to only UGX.72.595Bn in line with the reduced revenue collections to finance only priority activities in the original approved budget of UGX.119.469Bn for FY 2020-2021. I noted that the Authority prepared and submitted all the quarterly reports to the line ministry. However, there were delays in submission of Q1, Q2 & Q4 performance reports due to the effect of the covid-19 pandemic. I noted decreasing Tourism Revenues due to Covid-19 Effect. It was observed that the Authority has a total outstanding receivables balance of UGX.3.303Bn in the statement of financial position, of which UGX.2.244Bn are unpaid overdue fees from concessionaires that have been outstanding for more than a year. It was noted that the entity has outstanding payables of UGX.71.655Bn in the statement of financial position of which UGX.8.422Bn are accrued staff gratuity that becomes due at the end of each staff’s four year contract. UWA had only disbursed UGX.642,455,690 in respect of revenue sharing for the surrounding communities in Lake Mburo National Park, leaving a balance of UGX.9,697,730,137 un-disbursed. The Accountabilities of the disbursed grants have not yet been availed by the beneficiary communities through to the district local governments by the time of audit on 3rd November 2021.

By the time of reporting, discussions on transitional arrangements were ongoing. However, I was not provided with the transitional plans for a smooth merger. Delayed decision making leads to costly mergers and uncertainity amonst the stakeholders. Five (5) procurements with a total value of UGX.3.239Bn were not implemented as planned due to insufficient release of funds from GOU and the adverse effects of the covid-19 pandemic resulting into delayed service delivery. Although some electronic equipment and motor vehicles at cost of UGX.331Mn had been fully depreciated as per the previous financial year, they were still in use. Under the circumstances, the benefits accruing from them are not matched with their usage/expenditure. Management explained that the revaluation of assets had started, but COVID – 19 effects hindered the process. 9 Uganda Wildlife Education Conservation Centre. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 10 | Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities.  2020/21.

Unimplemented procurements signify unimplemented activities and therefore delayed service delivery. Contrary to Section 26 (4) of the PPDA 2003, procurements for stationery worth UGX.1.67Bn were concluded without carrying out market assessments. As a result, I could not establish how the estimated unit cost for these procurements was arrived at, thus implying that the procurements may have been awarded at exorbitant costs. A review of the Board\\'s establishment structure revealed that 38 posts out of the approved 85 remained vacant during the year, indicating a 45% understaffing level. Most notable among the vacant positions are key staffs like the Director Marketing, Director Quality Assurance, Director Finance and planning, and Manager Human Resource. Inadequate staffing levels not only deprive the entity of the skills required to enhance service delivery but also frustrates segregation of duty. 11 Uganda Tourism Board. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n|| WATER  AND ENVIRONMENT SECTOR |<| \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|^|<||  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Contingent Liabilities A contractor’s global claim of Euros 25,043,073 arising from the contractual obligation of extension of time and causation of delays in project completion which was approved; A compensation claim of UGX220 Million which is now before the Land Division of the High Court Civil suit No.109 of 2019 and thus the outcome of the compensation claim will be determined by court; A compensation of UGX1.15 Billion which is now before the Land Division of the High Court HCCS NO. 518 of 2016 and thus the outcome of the compensation claim will be determined by court. 1 Kampala Sanitation Program (KSP) Closure  2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 2. | National Forestry Authority 2020/21 |<| \\uf0b7 The Authority prepared and had its strategic plan for the period 2020/2021 to 2024/2025 approved by the Board, however there was no certification from NPA. |  \\n|^| Unqualified Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 Out of the approved NTR estimate of UGX 12.966 billion, the Authority |  \\n|^|^|<| collected UGX 10.372 billion representing a performance of 80% of the |  \\n|^|^|<| target.

However, no formal estimate of the recoverable amount has been conducted. This may result into an overstatement of the total assets and understatement of operating loss. I noted that the Company had an outstanding receivable of UGX.1.26Bn as at 30th June 2021, 54% of the amount relates to unpain rent from Tibet Hima Mining Co. Ltd. Delayed recovery of outstanding revenues affects the Company’s liquidity position. I noted that the Company had outstanding payables of UGX.2.28Bn. The amount increased from UGX.0.966 to UGX.2.286Bn resulting into an increase of UGX.1.321Bn (137%) as at 30th June 2021. I noted delayed divesture of Kilembe Mines. Three (3) years have elapsed without an investor/operator being identified to take over Kilembe Mines operations, following the termination of the Tibet Hima Concession Agreement. Emergency Funding of UGX 4.375bn was required to rehabilitate the damaged Company rivers Nyamambwa and Mubuku in May and August 2020. However, the requested funds were not availed. infrastructure following flooding of Mubuku Hydro-Power Plant was designed to generate 5MW. I however noted that the plant was only generating 2MW from Unit 1. Units 2 to 4 were out of service for a number of years. Review of the Annual Performance Report, 2021 revealed that the Company had a number of long outstanding court cases, relating to encroachment of Land belonging to the company.

I also noted that whereas the University had prepared and submitted its strategic plan to NPA for approval, it had not yet been approved at the time of audit in October 2021. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2021 and noted that the University budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.95.84Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.58.29Bn was collected, representing a performance of 60.82% of the target. I further noted that the University budgeted to receive UGX.363.74Bn out of which UGX.359.86Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.3.88Bn which is 1.1% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect implementation of the planned activities. Out of the total warrants of UGX.359.86Bn received during the financial year, UGX.357.04Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.2.82Bn representing an absorption level of 99.2%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by PFMA. I noted that the University received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX.237,398,885,878 which was not declared to Treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. These funds were received directly from both development partners and other stakeholders for undertaking activities not budgeted for. \\uf0b7 I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities for a 12 Makerere University. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n265\\n\\n---\\n\\nsample of ten (10) outputs with a total of forty two (42) activities and expenditure of UGX.356.85Bn and noted that two (2) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.265.85Bn were fully quantified. Two (2) outputs with a total of twenty-five (25) activities and expenditure worth UGX.30.11Bn were insufficiently quantified while six (6) outputs with a total of ten (10) activities and expenditure worth UGX.60.89Bn were not quantified at all. I observed that in cases where outputs were either partially or not quantified, management reported performance in generic ways.\\n\\n- I assessed implementation of two (2) out puts that were fully quantified with a sample of seven (7) activities worth UGX.265.85Bn and noted that one (1) output with a total of three (3) activities worth UGX 4.06Bn was fully implemented while one (1) output with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX.261.78Bn were partially implemented.\\n\\n- During the financial year under review, the University lost its main administration building and other assets therein to a fire that gutted the main administration Block on the 20th day of September 2020. The fire caused substantial damage to the main building whose value was estimated at UGX.15,434,782,500 by the Chief Government Valuer.\\n\\n- The Statement of reported losses of Public moneys, stores and other assets during the year showed the reported losses of assets/property of total estimated value of UGX.16,457,577,500.\\n\\n- The University had a receivables balance of UGX.25,527,015,916 as at 30/6/2021 broken down as accrued income of UGX.23,372,851,776 and a prepayment of UGX.2,154,164,140 to UMEME for electricity bulk purchase. The accumulation of receivables may lead to under performance of the university on its planned activities.\\n\\n- The University has an outstanding pension liability of UGX.18,920,219,207, inclusive of interest as reported in the Statement of Financial Position for the year ended 30th June 2021 resulting from accumulation of In-House Retirement Benefits since 2010. Delayed payment of retirement benefits may result in nugatory expenditure if the retirees decide to take the University to court.\\n\\n- The Statement of Financial Position showed accumulation of domestic arrears of UGX.7,819,385,752 as at 30th June 2021. I noted that majority of these arrears were from the prior years. There is a risk that the University could face litigation from the suppliers and other beneficiaries.\\n\\n- I noted that the main University installations/buildings such as the Senate, the Library, School of Women and Gender Studies and others are not comprehensibly insured. In case of a catastrophe, the University is at risk of huge financial obligations to the tenants.\\n\\n- I noted that there are non-qualifying persons occupying the University buildings. These were identified to be former University staff (retirees), unknown persons and Uganda Police Officers whose services were transferred from Makerere University.\\n\\n- I noted that water bills for the year under review were neither read nor submitted to the finance department for deductions. I noted that staff salaries were arbitrarily deducted to clear their water consumption without following one’s monthly water consumption.\\n\\n- The University owns various pieces of land totalling to 102 Acres in prime locations around Kampala including Makerere, Mulago and Makindye.

It was however noted that the university had not secured certificate of titles confirming ownership of the two (2) pieces of land. A review of the staff establishment at the directorates and Colleges revealed an overall staffing gap of 915 positions, which is 44.9 % of the approved establishment. The understaffing was mainly at the Associate Professor level and Professor level.

Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.0.67Bn for the year 2020/2021only UGX.0.073Bn was collected, representing a performance of 9% of the target. Similarly, the Institute budgeted to receive UGX.8.5bn from GOU \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Uganda Petroleum Institute Kigumba  2020/21 Unqualified 44 Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n274\\n\\n---\\n\\n| of which UGX.6.65bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX. 1.85bn representing 21% of the budget. I noted that the Institute spent all the funds that was available amounting to UGX.6.92bn representing 100% performance. I noted that Seven (7) outputs with fifteen (15) activities and expenditure worth UGX.4Bn were fully quantified. That is, 100% of the activities within these out-puts were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance. I further noted that Twelve (12) outputs with Twenty two (22) activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.49Bn was not quantified to enable assessment of performance. Out of the Seven (7) quantified outputs three (3) outputs with seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX 4.39Bn were fully implemented while two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX.0.25Bn were partially implemented as two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX0.33Bn were not implemented. That is none of the four (4) activities was implemented at all. The Institute had accumulated domestic arrears totalling to UGX. UGX.1.03Bn by the closure of the financial year under review (2020/2021) thereby being expressed to risk of litigation. The Institute had outstanding receivables totalling to UGX.0.055Bn by the closure of the financial year under review. Construction of Female hostel block, 2 Lecture halls, Library and an information Centre and Health Centre had delayed by 20months from the initial completion date of 27th March, 2020. Out of the 103 approved staff established of the Institute, only 84 posts had been filled leaving 19 (18%) positions vacancies. I further noted that in spite of the vacant positions, the Institute had recruited an additional Forty-six (46) staff on contract terms outside the approved structure. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 45 | Tb Preventive Therapy for Hiv-Infected Alcohol Users in Uganda: An Evaluation of Safety,  and Adherence  (ADEPTT) Tolerability |<| I noted that the closing balance of USD 12,178.00 was different from the balance brought forward as at 1st September 2017 of USD 9,615.58 creating a difference of USD 2,562.42.

I noted that although the Company realized 101% of the budgeted, the original budget was revised from UGX.6.07Bn to UGX.2.63bn to match the expected revenue. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.2.66bn, UGX. 1.36 Bn was resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.1.3bn representing an absorption level of 51%. I noted that the Stadium quantified all its five (5) outputs and all the outputs were partially implemented whereby out of forty four (44) activities, the entity fully implemented seven (7) activities (16%), partially implemented five (5) activities (11%), while thirty two (32) activities (73%) remained unimplemented. I noted that MNSL liabilities remained on a higher side despite a registered decrease  in the F/Y 2019/2020 to UGX.3.89Bn as at the end of the financial year under review representing a reduction of UGX.1.49 (28%). from UGX.5.38Bn I noted that Mandela National stadium closed the financial year with a receivables figure of UGX.2.42Bn, a reduction of only 7% from receivables of UGX.2.59 as at the end of the previous FYR: 2019/2020. I noted that the Company did not implement its Staffing Strategy of the current running strategic plan 2018-2023. I noted that stadium Land continues to have illegal occupants.

The University collected UGX.40.9Bn (53%) of its budgeted non-tax revenue of UGX.77.1Bn. I further noted that the university received UGX.130.07Bn (93%) out of the budgeted GOU receipts amount of UGX.140.6Bn. Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.130.07Bn, only UGX.124.5 was spent by the University resulting into unspent balance of UGX.5.53Bn representing an absorption level of 96%. The University received Donor financing to the tune of UGX.3.11Bn of which only UGX.2.68Bn had been included in the budget reflecting off budget receipts of UGX.0.43Bn. I noted that out of the 14 outputs sampled, 4 out puts (29%) were fully quantified, 8 out puts (57%) were insufficiently quantified while 2 out puts (14%) were not quantified at all. I also noted that the University did not fully implement any of the 4 fully quantified out puts. The University had outstanding domestic arrears and outstanding receivables of UGX.13.6Bn and UGX.23.2Bn, respectively. Some of the University land had illegal land occupants. I further noted that there were variations between the area on the Certificate of Tittle and actual Area on the ground for plot M902 of the University land. Out of the 1,671 approved posts for the University, only 928 (55.5%) were filled leaving 743 (45.5%) posts vacant. This has a negative impact on education service delivery.

Out of the eleven (11) outputs with a total of seventy three (73) activities and expenditure of UGX.36.88 Bn, nine (9) outputs with a total of sixty eight (68) activities and expenditure worth UGX 35.95 Bn were fully quantified, one (1) output with a total of two (2) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.16Bn were insufficiently quantified, and one (1) output with a total of one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX 0.77Bn was not quantified to enable assessment of performance. I assessed the implementation of nine (9) out puts that were fully quantified with a total of sixty eight (68) activities worth UGX.35.95Bn and noted the following; Two (2) outputs with 2 (two) activities worth UGX 0.75 Bn were fully implemented. The entity implemented the two (2) activities (100%) within the outputs. Secondly; seven (7) outputs with a total of sixty six (66) activities worth UGX.35.20Bn were partially implemented. Out of the sixty six (66) activities, the entity fully implemented forty one (41) activities (62%); partially implemented seven (7) activities (11%) and eighteen (18) activities (27%) remained unimplemented. I noted that goods and services totalling to UGX.5,296,396,760 did not have corresponding WHT transactions totalling to UGX.317,783,806 on the IFMS payment file.

Similarly, the project budgeted to receive UGX.1.25Bn, of which UGX.1.07Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX. 0.18 Bn (14.4%) of the budget. I noted that all project outputs were fully quantified. I also noted that the project fully implemented one of the sampled outputs, partially implemented one and two outputs were not implemented. I noted delayed Signing of Contract for Supply of a Spray track for UTC Lira valued at Euros 205,200 had delayed for 9 months by end of November 2021, following the contracts committee’s approval on 23rd/02/2021.

The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA.\\n\\n- I noted that the School received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX. 549Bn from NOHRED/NORAD Project Support which was not declared to treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament.\\n\\n- I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities for a sample of twelve (12) outputs with a total of seventy three (73) activities and expenditure of UGX.91.667Bn and noted that five (5) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.031Bn were fully quantified. One (1) output with a total of twenty four (24) activities and expenditure worth UGX.77.002Bn, was insufficiently quantified while six (6) outputs with a total of thirty five (35) activities and expenditure worth UGX 11.633Bn were not quantified at all.\\n\\n- I assessed the implementation of five (5) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX 3.031Bn and noted that; Three (3) outputs with eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX 1.694Bn were fully implemented. One (1) output with two (2) activities worth UGX.1.336Bn was partially implemented while one (1) output with four (4) activities with a budget of UGX.1.159Bn was not implemented.\\n\\n- The entity disclosed receivables to the tune of UGX.21,730,133,664. This reflected an increase in receivables by UGX.12,025,676,995 (124%) from the previous year’s balance of UGX.9,704,456,669. The accumulation of receivables impacts negatively on the operations of the University and the education service delivery.\\n\\n- The Statement of Financial Position showed accumulation of payables to the tune of UGX.1,215,592,931 as at 30th June 2021. I noted that these payables were accumulated in the current year and largely related to suppliers of goods and services. Accumulation of payables poses a risk of litigation and or loss of trust against the University from the suppliers of the goods and services.\\n\\n- The financial statements showed that MUBS was involved in several court cases/legal proceedings of a total value UGX.2,899,977,221 in various courts of law that remained pending as at the financial year end. There is a risk that in case of un-favourable rulings, the School may incur more financial losses.\\n\\n- A review of the statement of cash flow revealed payment of domestic arrears of UGX.9,601,334,785 against UGX.330,708,964 that was budgeted and warranted for payment of domestic arrears. Payment of\\n\\n285\\n\\n---\\n\\n| funds to un-appropriated budget lines leads to non-implementation of budgeted for activities. I noted that the School had five (5) pieces of land recorded in the assets register that have never been valued to ascertain the monetary value. I also noted that the land in Kireka had squatters and the possibility of reclaiming it may prove to be challenging. The encroachment on the School land was attributed to failure to gazette and develop the land. \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 79 | The Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development In Higher Education And |<| The Project ended, and as at the end of the six-month period ended 31st December, 2020, funds to the tune of USD. 272,213 (Nok2,054,787) remained unspent, and it was refunded to the Funders. \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^| Research For Development (Norhed) 2020 |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<||  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^| Unqualified |<|^|  \\n| \\uf0b7 No material Issues reported Environment  for Development Initiative (Efd- Mak Centre) Project Makerere University for The Period 1st January - 31st December 2020 Unqualified 80 Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 82 | Nurture: Research Training and Mentoring Program for Career Development of |<| \\uf0b7 No material Issues reported |  \\n|^|^|<||  \\n|^| Faculty in Medical Education |<|^|  \\n|^| Partnership  Initiative |<|^|  \\n|^| Institutions (Mepi) At |<|^|  \\n|^| Makerere University College |<|^|  \\n|^| of Health Sciences - 2018 |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^| Unqualified |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n| AND INNOVATION SECTOR SCIENCE |<|<|<|  \\n| 1. | Kiira Motors Corporation. 2019/2020 |<| I noted that at the time of the audit (June 2020), out of the planned six (6) strategic targets/goals, three (3) targets had been fully achieved and three (3) were partially achieved \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^| Unqualified Opinion |<|^|  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 100 acres of land, in Kiira Town Council, Jinja District land was only |  \\n|^|^|<| disclosed as a note without value attached and neither is it recorded in |  \\n|^|^|<| the assets register. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 Failure to handover funds worth UGX.8,923,350,798 to Makerere |  \\n|^|^|<| University, since these funds had been specially released for Kiira Motors |  \\n|^|^|<| as a project under Makerere University. |  \\n|^|^|<| \\uf0b7 I observed that only two of the nine (9) members of the Board of |  \\n|^|^|<| Directors, the Executive Chairperson and the Chief Executive Officer were |  \\n|^|^|<| duly appointed, leading to an inadequately constituted Board. |  \\n| I noted that out of the 3 strategic targets, PIBID partially attained them, with the hope of fully attaining the targets by the end of the strategic \\uf0b7 Presidential Initiative on Banana Industrial Development (PIBID). 2. |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n286\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 plan period.

It was observed that the entity has not taken off full operations as it remains cash strapped with limited subventions from the Ministry of Science Technology and innovation. There was no evidence of the establishment of the Institutional Framework and Governance Board and the renewal of the appointment of the Board and Management Committee Members. During the financial year, a total of UGX.29,230,320 was paid to the Executive Director as man-day allowance for signing 12 contracts on behalf of the organization, yet this is one of her roles for which a monthly salary is paid. A total of UGX.272,694,000 was paid to various staff as allowances for working over the weekend. The internal audit department had only one draft internal audit report with no evidence that the report was submitted to the Accounting Officer and Internal Auditor General. PIBID recruited staff during the year 2019/2020 without an approved recruitment plan for the period. Audit noted that PIBID did not have an approved salary structure on which it bases to pay individual staff I noted that the entity lacked land titles for its land at Sanga (approximately 50 acres) and land where the water source is located at Kyamugambira (approximately 4 acres). Management deducted UGX.633,205,884, as PAYE, from employee’s salaries but was not remitted to Uganda Revenue Authority.

I however did not obtain evidence of a proper transition plan which has led to delayed disbursement of funding for subventions and independent projects. The merger further rendered 136 technical scientist staff redundant and were not paid emoluments by the end of November, 2021. I advised management to ensure that a smooth transition process is undertaken. Out of the total budget for the financial year of UGX.150Bn, only UGX.144.6Bn was received by the Ministry resulting into a shortfall of UGX.5.737Bn (equivalent to 3.5% of the budget). Shortfalls in revenue result into non implementation of planned activities. Out of 20 quantified activities worth UGX.105.9Bn that were assessed; 13 activities representing 65% were fully implemented, 5 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 10% were not implemented. I advised management to roll over critical activities to subsequent years and ensure that they are implemented before the end of the National Development Plan III. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.834Mn were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I advised management to always ensure that proper authorization is obtained before implementing any unbudgeted activities. Most of the research projects that had received funds for COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments had not made much progress. Delays were majorly attributed to the late disbursement of funds and delayed delivery of Equipment. I advised management to ensure thorough due diligence before funds are allocated to the projects. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Technology and Innovation. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 5 | Kiira Motors Corporation. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion |<| Cabinet approved the roadmap for the commercialisation of the Kiira Electric vehicle project with a seed fund of UGX.143.7Bn to be availed over a period of 4 years effective 2018/19. Only 59% of the seed fund had been released in the previous three financial years, casting doubt as to whether the balance of UGX.58.4Bn (41%) would be released in the \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|^|<| remaining one year.

I noted that of the civil works that were to be completed |  \\n|^|^|<| by June 2021 (a period of 2 years and six (6) months), only 82% of those |  \\n|^|^|<| works had been completed due to insufficient funding.

Out of the 41 outputs assessed, 34 outputs representing 83% were fully implemented; four (4) outputs representing 10% were partially implemented, while three (3), representing 7%, were not implemented. I noted that there was no evidence that the Accounting Officer prepared or submitted the annual budget performance reports of the Council by 31st July 2021 as required by regulations. I noted that the entity did not prepare and submit the annual monitoring plans to the line Ministry for consolidation and onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance Economic and Economic Planning. I established that UGX.94Mn was directly paid to staff’s personal bank accounts, yet this money could have been directly paid to the intended final recipients. Out of the 85 planned activities assessed, 69 outputs/activities representing 81% were implemented; 9 outputs/activities representing 11% were partially implemented, while seven (7) outputs/activities representing 8% were not implemented at all. fully I noted that the Council did not produce the annual report as required by the UNCST Act. A review of the procurement file for the Supply of ICT Equipment under EDCTP-SCRECU Project revealed no evidence of any public bid opening session, which creates doubts as to whether the bidders attended the bid opening session.

I observed conflicting in the Council governing laws. Section 51(2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 requires the Accounting Officer of a public corporation, within two months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Accountant-General, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury. On the contrary, Section 18 (1) Part IV of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 1996 requires the Council to keep proper books of accounts and prepare the annual financial statements of accounts for the immediately preceding financial year not later than three months in the following year. Conflict in the governing laws hampers effective execution of UNMC mandate. Section 4 of the UNMC Act 1996, requires each Council member to be a seconded representative of a particular institution or body and must be appointed by the Minister. However, a review of Council Members records revealed that out of the seventeen (17) members, none of them were seconded representatives of their respective bodies. Good Corporate Governance practices require separation of duties of board members to ensure their independence in the discharge of duties. On the contrary, a review of the composition of the Audit Committee revealed that Chairperson of the full council is also a member of the committee. I noted that the Council had not been managed by a substantive Registrar since 2017. The current Registrar’s initial appointment ran from November 2018 to March 2019. However, management did not provide a valid appointment letter to confirm her appointment after March 2019. A review of the Governing council minute ref FC/08/14/06/2020 revealed that council members were concerned about the significant delays in issuing of Practicing Certificates that hindered the recruitment of nurses in the industry. Furthermore, Management did not avail status reports on certificates that were produced. Payment files and PPDA monthly reports revealed that supplies and service worth UGX 46,183,800 were procured and paid without going through the procurement process given that there were no LPOs or procurement documents availed to confirm that the supplier went through the procurement process. UNMC has three (3) operational vehicles. However, a detailed review of the fleet management revealed that there were no log books maintained to track the vehicle movements as required by the regulations. Further, there were no records being maintained to keep track of vehicle history, performance, servicing, overheads, repairs and maintenance. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 7. | Uganda Sanitation Fund (USF) – Ministry of Health Project.  2019/20 Opinion |<| \\uf0b7 A review of the annual work plan and the performance reports for the Uganda Sanitation Fund revealed that there were inconsistencies in planned targets and those reported upon.

The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 after the prescribed deadline. In addition, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which are important in ensuring that the budget performs as expected.

The receipts were also not reported in Note 5 to the Financial Statements. It was further noted that the funds which were received on the Hospital’s Infrastructure Development Account were transfers from Ministry of Health meant for intern allowances. The Hospital had liabilities of UGX 2,952,608,319 from the previous year (FY 2019/20) in respect of payables (UGX 2,304,366,476) and deposits (UGX 648,241,843). However, payments totalling to UGX3,775,748,845 in respect of the liabilities were made.

This budget was later revised to UGX 376.884Bn, out of which UGX 376.837Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX 47m (representing 0.012% of the approved budget). Out of the total UGX 1,029.646Bn received during the year under review, UGX 852.099Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 177.547Bn (representing an absorption level of 82.8%).

Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears.\\n\\n- I noted that one pensioner; Okenga Abedican delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays of 31 days. Delayed access to the pension payroll leads to poor wellbeing of the affected retirees as well as accumulation of pension arrears.\\n\\n- I observed that there were variances of UGX.263,261,431 between the figures in the MoPS IPPS and district payroll registers.

The shortfalls in Local Revenue collections of UGX.744,264,437 (71%) were recorded in Local Service Tax, Land Fees , Business Licence, other tax revenues, administrative fees and Application Fees.\\n\\n- The District budgeted to receive UGX. 1,426,989,000 as external/donor financing out of which UGX.1,304,944 (0.09%), was received.\\n\\n- Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.28,843,895,403, UGX.25,055,771,226 (97%) was spent by the district resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.3,788,124,204. The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.\\n\\n- I noted that the district prepared annual monitoring plans dated 02/08/2021, but had not been submitted to MoFPED, MoLG and NPA as required by the time of audit (10/09/2021). Further, the district had not also submitted quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED as required by the time of audit (10/09/2021). This practice is not only in contravention of the circular instructions but also hinders efforts of timely monitoring of the implementation of the budget.\\n\\n- I noted that management submitted performance reports for Q1 and Q2 in time while performance reports for Q3 and Q4 were submitted after deadline given for submission of the reports.\\n\\n- In addition, I did not obtain evidence to confirm that the Accounting Officer Prepared Monitoring Plans and reports which are important in ensuring that the budget performs as expected.\\n\\n- I noted delayed completion of Construction of Atyak Seed Secondary School under the UGIFT project, A joint supervision report dated 18/5/2021 was reviewed and put the work so far done at only 66% and cumulative total payments had been made of UGX 1,365,729,024 ( representing 65% of the contract sum) by end of year. By the time of the audit in September 2021, about 5% of the works were still incomplete yet the contract had long expired.\\n\\n- I noted that the District received a total of UGX.154,269,648.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that pensioners promptly access the payroll and are subsequently paid.\\n\\n- I noted that 16 employees were paid a total of UGX.52 million without signed pay change reports. This affects the integrity/credibility of the payroll and creates an avenue for payroll abuse.\\n\\n- I noted that the District did not prepare monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis and thus did not submit quarterly returns on payroll to MoPS, contrary to Paragraph 2.1 of Establishment Notice No. 1 of 2020. The Accounting Officer took note of the observation and stated that action has been initiated during Q1 of the FY 2021/22.\\n\\n- A comparison of the payroll register and IFMS payment file, I noted that 3 pensioners were paid a total of UGX.75,420,453 off the IPPS.

As a result, the pay roll analysis for Terego District was made under the audit of Arua DLG. I, noted that although the district aligned its targets for the F/Y 2020/2021 with the DDPIII and NDPIII, the District strategic plan had not been approved. I advised the Accounting Officer to urgently prepare and approved a strategic plan that is aligned to NDP-III to facilitate the achievement of the NDP objectives I reviewed the approved Local revenue estimates for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that the District budgeted to collect UGX. 116,717,055 during the year but collected UGX.89,153,132 representing (76%) performance. The shortfalls in Local Revenue collections of UGX. UGX.27,563,923(24%) were recorded in Local Service Tax, Land Fees , Business Licence, other tax revenues, administrative fees and Application Fees. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 The District budgeted to receive UGX. 23,749,241,508 (revised) as grants from the Treasury.

TEREGO DLG Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n406\\n\\n---\\n\\n| of the financial year 2020/2021 their Budget release was only for the six months thus explaining the poor performance. \\uf0b7 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX. 6.5Bn, UGX. 5.9Bn (91%) was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.6 Bn (91%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. The funds were meant for activities that were not fully implemented by the end of the financial year and these include Salaries worth UGX.475,796,820. \\uf0b7 During field Inspection carried out on service delivery areas at Yinga HC III, I observed the following;  \\uf0d8 Fridge for storage of blood donated by IRC and UNICEF was not installed consequently, cases of anaemia are referred to other facilities;  \\uf0d8 Motorised borehole that was installed by OXFAM had been \\uf0d8 disconnected for six months;  the piped water system installed at the facility had broken down for the period of six months;  \\uf0d8 As per interview of in-charge of the facility, the facility had not been supplied drugs for two quarters leading to drug stock-outs. This led to the referral of cases that would have been handled at the facility; \\uf0d8 The generator that was donated to the HC has never been installed during the two years it has been at the facility I reviewed of the governance structures of Terego DLG and noted that the district did not have a District Land Board in place. Consequently, the institutional land of the district was not titled. Further, there were reports of land disputes as seen in the Council Minutes dated 21st May 2021. I reviewed the execution of the annual procurement plan of Terego district for the year under review revealed that projects worth UGX.740,372,862 were not executed in the year, hence hindering service delivery to the intended beneficiaries. I reviewed the implementation of the DRDIP project in the district and observed that 16 beneficiary projects funded to the tune of UGX.1,620,066,939 had not yet been implemented. The Accounting Officer promised immediate action. I await the outcome of the Accounting Officers action. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 05. | NEBBI DLG |<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the District did not submit wage estimates to MoPS, |  \\n|||<| as required.

I further noted that there was an under payment of UGX.32,297,600 as well. The Accounting Officer acknowledged the shortcoming and promised future action. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 A comparison of base pay in the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) payroll registers with the salary structure for 2020/21, revealed that 6 staff were paid using wrong salary scales, leading to over payments of UGX.3,190,260 contrary to Section B–a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.

Audit Act 2008 and the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, as amended, I hereby present to you the Annual Audit Report on the Consolidated Public Accounts of Uganda; Local Government, and Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations, and State Enterprises and Companies in which Government has a controlling interest.\\n\\nIn line with the above mandate, I audited financial statements for 186 MDAs, 83 Statutory Corporations and 151 Local Governments. In addition, I undertook four (4) thematic audits covering: Payroll management in Local Governments following last year\\'s audit outcomes that necessitated deepening payroll audit procedures; Management of IT investments across Government; Management of Public Land; and Implementation of the Approved Budget for the 3 rd time since 2019/2020 financial year, to ensure that the appropriated funds are spent appropriately as planned.\\n\\nThe Office\\'s commitment to undertake audits that add value to society remains my main focus. However, during the year, the emergency of Ebola, insecurity in the Karamoja region as well as limited staff resources affected audit activities in the affected areas. These audits will be performed in the 2 nd half of this financial year 2022/2023.\\n\\nI extend my gratitude to the Government of Uganda and all other stakeholders for the support rendered to my Office during the audit year to ensure the continued delivery of my mandate. I also thank my staff for their steady commitment and support towards undertaking audits aimed at improving \\\\`the well-being of Citizens’.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn F.S. Muwanga AUDITOR GENERAL\\n\\n30 th December 2022\\n\\n---\\n\\n**PART 1: INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF THE REPORT** **1.0 INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE** 1.1 General Introduction**\\n\\nI am required by Article 163(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda and Section 13 and 19 of the National Audit Act, 2008 and the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 as amended, to audit and report on the public accounts of Uganda and of all public offices including the Courts, the Central and Local Government Administrations, Universities and Public Institutions of like nature and any Public Corporations or other bodies established by an Act of Parliament.\\n\\nSection 13 (b) of the National Audit Act, 2008 further requires me to conduct the following audits:\\n\\n- Financial audits\\n- Value for money\\n- Engineering\\n- Information Systems\\n- Special/Forensic Audits\\n- Gender and Environment and any other audits in respect of any project or activity involving public funds\\n- Classified expenditure\\n- Government investments\\n- Procurement audits, and\\n- Treasury Memoranda\\n\\nUnder Article 163 (4) of the Constitution, I am also required to submit to Parliament annually a report of the accounts audited by me for the year immediately preceding.

The SORA profiled all the audits under the mandate based on different risk factors. Out of the total population of 17,494, 3,996 (21%) with a total budget of (UGX.43.42Tn) representing 97% of the total GoU budget were selected for audit.\\n\\nA total of 2,056 audits which includes schools and tertiary institutions could not be completed due to the effects of Ebola pandemic, insurgencies in Karamoja region and resource constraints. The restricted movement in Mubende and Kassanda districts disrupted the audit schedules and 5 HLGs of Karenga DLG, Kaabong DLG, Kotido DLG, Kotido MC, Abim DLG have not been audited due to security concerns.\\n\\nThe forensic investigations and special audit reports have been issued to the respective stakeholders who requested for them.

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022**\\n\\n**THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion**\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of the Republic of Uganda for the year ended 30 th June 2022. These financial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement together with other accompanying statements, notes, and accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th June 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n**Basis of Opinion**\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Treasury in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n**Key Audit Matter**\\n\\n---\\n\\nOver the years, I have observed improvements in the performance regarding implementation of the budget but entities still face a number of challenges including Covid-19, which continue to affect implementation of activities, service delivery and credibility of the budget. It is against this background that budget performance was considered a key audit area during the office- wide planning. I reviewed documents such as work plans, performance reports, conducted interviews and physical inspection in arriving at my findings.\\n\\nThe approved initial revenue and expenditure budget estimates of the Government of Uganda were **UGX.44.8Tn.** This was later revised, with the revenue budget being increased to **UGX.47.2Tn** while the expenditure budget was increased to **UGX.51.6Tn.** A total of **UGX.48.9Tn** was finally warranted to implement Government programmes. I reviewed the implementation of the approved 2021/2022 budget by Government and noted the following;\\n\\n**Table 4: Showing findings from review of Budget Performance** No Observation Recommendation 1.1 Revenue Performance**\\n\\nA review of the approved budget estimates of the The PS/ST was advised to Government of Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th continue exploring more June 2022 revealed that the initial approved revenue avenues of ensuring that all budget was **UGX.44.8Tn.** This was later budgeted revenue is always revised/increased by **UGX.2.4Tn** to **UGX.47.2Tn.** realised to fund the budget However, **UGX.44.4Tn** was realised representing as approved.  \\n**94.2%** revenue performance level.\\n\\nAlthough the performance is commendable, the shortfall implies that government could not fully finance its planned programmes, which in turn affected service delivery.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that while tax revenues were affected by poor economic conditions in 2021/22, the overall performance was very good. He further stated that Non-Tax Revenue collections were affected by the general slow economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19.\\n\\n**1.2 Utilization/expenditure of Funds**\\n\\nOut of the total available funds of **UGX.48.9Tn** warranted The PS/ST was advised to during the financial year, **UGX.44.4Tn** was spent by explore strategies aimed at Government resulting into an unutilized balance of addressing implementation **UGX.4.5Tn** representing a performance level of challenges and also consider 90.93%.The summary is shown in the table below;\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **No Observation Recommendation** |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| observed that the failure to utilize the funds was attributed to the following; Some entities could not raise invoices to utilise all the funds available to them, due to implementation challenges and late release of funds.  b)  There was a mismatch between total funds issued and the total actual revenue collections, resulting into a funding gap. The PS/ST stated that in the FY 2021/22, the economy was slowly recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and the projected revenues were not realised. However, the Ministry is committed to ensuring that Budget preparation and execution is credible. To enhance revenues, Government is implementing the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation Strategy, while on the expenditure side, Government has re-prioritised interventions to fit the resource envelop and in line with the NDP III. This will ensure revenues are matched with expenditure. I a) |<|<|<|  \\n| **1.3** | **Un-funded Approved Budget** |<||  \\n||^|<||  \\n|^| The PFMA, 2015 Section 15 (1) and (2) requires that after |<| The PS/ST was advised to |  \\n|^| approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the |<| ensure that all |  \\n|^| Secretary to the Treasury shall issue the annual cash flow |<| supplementary expenditure |  \\n|^| plan of Government, based on the procurement plans, |<| approvals are supported with |  \\n|^| work plans, and recruitment plans approved by |<| supplementary sources of |  \\n|^| parliament. The annual cash flow plan shall form the basis |<| financing to ensure that the |  \\n|^| for release of funds by the Accountant General to the |<| earlier appropriated activities |  \\n|^| Accounting Officers. |<| are implemented as planned. |  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n|^| Section 25(1) of the Public Finance and Accountability Act |<|<|  \\n|^| (PFMA) stipulates that the total supplementary |<|<|  \\n|^| expenditure that requires additional resources over and |<|<|  \\n|^| above what is approved by Parliament shall not exceed |<|<|  \\n|^| 3% of the total approved budget for that financial year, |<|<|  \\n|^| without the approval of Parliament. |<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n|^| Whereas the initial budget appropriated by Parliament |<|<|  \\n|^| was balanced (i.e. Revenue estimates equaled |<|<|  \\n|^| expenditure estimates), I noted that the revised budget |<|<|  \\n|^| as a result of supplementaries, had revenue estimates of |<|<|  \\n|^| **UGX.47.2Tn** as compared to expenditure estimates of |<|<|  \\n|^| **UGX.51.6Tn,** creating a budget deficit of **UGX.4.4Tn.** |<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n|^| Continued approval of supplementary budgets without a |<|<|  \\n|^| corresponding increase in revenue/financing, leads to |<|<|  \\n|^| increased funding gap that affects the earlier budget |<|<|  \\n|^| objectives and plans. For example, whereas the |<|<|  \\n|^| performance contracts with Accounting Officers are |<|<|  \\n|^| premised on availing the appropriated budgets during the |<|<|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **No** Observation** |<|<| **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| year, such contracts are not revised in situations of |<||  \\n|^| shortfalls in budgets. |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| The detailed impact of the budget shortfall on the entity |<|^|  \\n|^| activities has been reported in the individual entity |<|^|  \\n|^| reports. The PS/ST stated that supplementary funding |<|^|  \\n|^| was issued against targeted borrowings and enhanced |<|^|  \\n|^| revenue mobilization measures that did not materialize. |<|^|  \\n|^| However, going forward, supplementary funding will be |<|^|  \\n|^| issued against confirmed funding sources of inflows to |<|^|  \\n|^| avoid unfunded activities and over commitments. |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n| Section 6 of the Budget Execution Circular for the FY 2021/22 provides that all work plans and Budgets for FY2021/22 are prepared and approved using the Program Budgeting System (PBS). All Budgets, irrespective of the source of financing (GoU, NTR/AIA, Donor or LG Revenue), will be migrated and loaded into the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) to facilitate Budget Implementation and reporting. **1.4** Budgeting for Non-Tax Revenue** to the approved Budget estimates for the FY2021/22, it was projected that a total of **UGX.1.59Tn** would be collected as NTR. Review of Program Based Budgeting (PBB) tool used by the Government and IFMS records revealed that that NTR budgets for the respective MDAs were neither uploaded on PBS nor IFMS. The budgeting tool only had details regarding expenditure, and no revenue was included. I further noted that several Accounting Officers disowned the figures incorporated the NTR Estimates book, indicating that they had not been consulted in arriving at the estimates incorporated there in. As a result, I was unable to compare respective entity budget figures with the URA NTR collections that totaled to **UGX.2.42Tn.** Absence of proper revenue estimates for each entity undermines transparency, affects motivation of staff, and hampers performance assessment. explained that the PBS system has been enhanced and effective FY 2023/24, all Votes have budgeted NTR online and is uploaded into the IFMS. Going forward, the Accounting Officers are now able to budget for NTR on the PBS system. According Management |<|<| Accounting Officer is advised to ensure that all Ministries, Departments and Agencies budget the Non-Tax Revenue and have the details provided in the IFMS and the PBS. for The |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.2** UNSPENT BALANCES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR**\\n\\nAs reflected in the Consolidated Fund Statement on page 30 of the financial statements, prior year unspent balances amounting to **UGX.29.41Bn** (2020/2021: UGX.26.05Bn) were applied as part of the monies to fund the budget for FY2021/2022. Given that such balances arise out of the GoU Appropriation that expires at the end of the year in line with the PFMA 2015, its application in the subsequent financial year would require that a supplementary appropriation is sought before utilising the said balances.\\n\\nThis omission in the sources of funds available to fund the budget leads to distortions in form of an understatement of the country’s available resources for spending.\\n\\nThe PS/ST explained that indeed all GoU Appropriations expire at the end of the year in line with the PFMA 2015. However, it should be noted that GoU has been operating a deficit budget and therefore any residual unspent funds form part of the opening balances. All eligible requests for re-voting, that are submitted with proper justification, the unspent balances are provided as supplementary, for example for external funding, which is already provided through supplementary budgets since it necessitates adjustments to appropriation and work plans for the current year.\\n\\nI advised PS/ST going forward, to consider explicitly seeking a supplementary appropriation for all such unspent balances.\\n\\n**2.3** GOVERNMENT LOANS (BORROWINGS) – UGX.77.97Tn**\\n\\nAs disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the government Loans have increased from UGX.69.60Tn in 2021, to UGX.77.97Tn in 2022 constituting an increase of UGX.8.36Tn (12%). This position reflects an increase in borrowing that could make debt payment unsustainable for the country.\\n\\nManagement indicated that they intend to address the increasing public debt through implementation of the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) by aligning Government’s priority programmes and restricting borrowing to critical projects.\\n\\n**2.4 PAYABLES – UGX.7.545Tn**\\n\\n---\\n\\nundertaking measures that limit supplementary budgets with no matching grants, that end up impacting on already identified and appropriated revenue sources.\\n\\n**2.5** PENSION LIABILITIES - UGX.442.98Bn**\\n\\nAs disclosed in the statement of public debt, Pension liabilities increased from **UGX.162.3Bn** in 2021 to **UGX.442.98Bn** in 2022, representing of an increase of **UGX.280.68Bn** (173%). I noted that the Ministry of Information, Communication and National Guidance had the most significant amount of **UGX.320Bn,** arising out of the former employees of the defunct Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Limited. The continued failure to settle the pension arrears impacts on the welfare of the pensioners.\\n\\nI advised PS/ST to prioritise payment of pension arrears going forward.\\n\\n**2.6** CLASSIFIED EXPENDITURE – UGX.780Bn**\\n\\nAs disclosed under Note 8, a total of UGX.780Bn relates to classified expenditure. In compliance with Section 24 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (Classified Expenditure), this expenditure is audited separately and a separate audit report issued.\\n\\n**Other Matter**\\n\\nI consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements;\\n\\n**2.7 PUBLIC DEBT 2.7.1 Portfolio Analysis**\\n\\nThe reported total public debt as at 30 th June, 2022 stood at **UGX.86.6Tn** (2020/2021: UGX.75.1Tn), of which Domestic Debt Stock was **UGX.38.1Tn** and the External Debt Stock was valued at **UGX.48.5Tn.** This is an increase of **UGX.11.5Tn,** equivalent to 12.5% when compared to the debt stock of **UGX.75.1Tn** reported as at 30 th June 2021. Table below shows the details;\\n\\n**Table 5: Showing Public Debt for the last 5 Years** Financial Domestic debt Foreign debt Total (UGX Tn) % change** **year ended (UGX Tn)**  \\n**(UGX Tn)**  \\nJune 2022 38.1 48.5 86.6 15.3% June 2021 30.8 44.3 75.1 24.3% June 2020 18.0 38.2 56.9 23.5% June 2019 15.2 30.9 46.1 11.1% June 2018 13.1 28.4 41.4  \\n**Source:** Audited financial statements of Vote 130\\n\\n---\\n\\nI observed that Public debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of Government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, Bond switches, private placements, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. The graph below illustrates the trend of public debt stock by type over the past five years;\\n\\n**Public Debt Portfolio** 90  \\n80  \\n70  \\n60\\n\\n50\\n\\nDomestic debt (UGX Tn)\\n\\n40\\n\\nForeign debt (UGX Tn)\\n\\n30\\n\\nTotal (UGX Tn) 20  \\n10\\n\\n0  \\nJune 22 June 21 June 20 June 19 June 18\\n\\n**F i gure**\\n\\n2. **OAG Analysis:** Public Debt Portfolio\\n\\nAlthough Government has strengthened the budgeting process and reduced the number of unwarranted supplementary budget expenditure, this appears not to be in harmony with the continuing Government expenditure, raising concerns of debt sustainability.\\n\\nManagement explained that Government intends to address the concerns raised through the following ways;\\n\\ni.  \\nImplementation of the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) by aligning appropriate financing to Government’s priority programmes.\\n\\nii.  \\nBorrowing will be restricted for projects/expenditures that are critical to the economy.\\n\\niii.  \\nInstituting a more stringent process for prioritizing, vetting, rescheduling programmes and projects to be financed using borrowed resources in the next FY and medium term.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised Government to devise a comprehensive strategy aligning revenue mobilisation and fiscal management.\\n\\n**2.7.2 Analysis of External Debt**\\n\\nUganda’s external debt as at 30 th June 2022 is made up of Multilateral Creditors **(UGX.29.9Tn),** Bilateral Creditors **(UGX.13.5Tn)** and Commercial Banks **(UGX.5Tn).** Refer to the figure below;\\n\\n**External Debt**\\n\\n**Multilateral Creditors**\\n\\n**10%** Bilateral Creditors**\\n\\n**28%**\\n\\n**Figure 3:** OAG Analysis: External Debt\\n\\n**62% Commercial Banks**\\n\\nAnalysis of the trend of external debt over the last five years revealed a linear growth in the level of external debt over the years. There has been a consistent increase from **UGX.28.4Tn** in the Financial Year 2017/18 to **UGX.48.4Tn** in 2021/22, representing an overall growth of **70.6%** over the period. The details are given in Table and graph below;\\n\\n**Table 6: Showing growth in external debt**  \\n**Financial year AMOUNT (UGX Tn) Increase (UGX Tn)** % Change** 2021/22 48.4 4.4 10.1 2020/21 44.0 5.1 13.1 2019/20 38.9 8.0 25.9 2018/19 30.9 2.5 8.8 2017/18 28.4 6.2\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n) n 50  \\nT  \\n( 40  \\nt  \\nb  \\ne  \\n**AMOUNT (UGX Tn)**  \\nD 30  \\nl a  \\nn r 20  \\n**Linear (AMOUNT (UGX** e t **Tn))** x 10  \\nE\\n\\n0  \\n**2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22** **F** i gure**\\n\\n3. **OAG External debt analysis**\\n\\nIt was established that the major driver of the growth is the contraction of new debt mainly for budget support, which has put pressure on the economy and has led to further borrowing from the domestic market. However, there is a risk that this may not be sustainable in the short term.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer stated that Government intends to borrow largely on favourable terms by first exhausting concessional financing options to finance government projects. Government will continue to implement Domestic Revenue Mobilization efforts which will help in reducing the fiscal deficit and relive government on expensive borrowings.\\n\\nG overnment is advised to review the rate of contracting debt and also devise strategies to increase domestic revenue collections to enable servicing of the debt obligations.\\n\\n**2.7.3 Movement of Domestic Debt Stock**\\n\\nDomestic debt portfolio is composed of long term borrowings (Treasury Bonds and Government Bonds), short-term borrowings (Treasury Bills and Government overdraft/temporary advances), Court Awards, principal and Interest payment.\\n\\nThe country’s domestic debt stock, which is mainly on Treasury Bonds and Treasury Bills, and un-securitised debt amounted to **UGX.38.15Tn** as of 30 th June 2022 (2021: UGX.30.81Tn). Trends for the past four years of domestic debt portfolio are shown respectively in table below;\\n\\n**Table 7: Showing domestic debt stock for the past four years**  \\n**FY**  \\n**Domestic Debt Stock (face** Increase** **value)** UGX-Tn UGX (Tn) %** 2021/22 38.1 7.3 23.7 2020/21 30.8 12.9 71.5 2019/20 18 2.5 16.0 2018/19 15.5 2.4 18.7 2017/18  \\n13.1\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 8: Showing trends in net domestic financing** Details FY FY FY FY FY 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20( 2020/21 2021/22 (UGX-Tn)** **(UGX-Tn) (UGX-Tn) UGX-Tn) (UGX-Tn)**  \\nIssuances (Bills 6.4 7.4 8.5 13.7 13.0 & Bonds)  \\nRedemptions 4.6 5.2 5.9 7 8.4 (Bills & Bonds)  \\nNET Domestic 1.8 2.2 2.6 6.7 4.6 Financing\\n\\nFrom the above analysis, it can be deduced as follows;\\n\\na)\\n\\nAll Government instruments that have reached maturity/redemption are financed through debt rollover (borrowing to pay existing debt) and this has created a high dependence on the market and thus increases refinancing risk. Under subscription was observed, due to highly priced bids that were rejected in a bid to reduce the cost of debt.\\n\\nb)\\n\\nIn the year under audit, a decrease of **31%** was registered in Net Domestic Financing (NDF) from **UGX.6.7Tn to UGX.4.6Tn.** However, it should be noted that the decrease in net domestic financing was as a result of under subscription of treasury instruments as the approved NDF for the FY was **UGX.5.5Tn.**\\n\\nContinued reliance on Net Domestic Financing, signals Government’s borrowing appetite, whereby the market players are inclined to demand increased rates well aware that Government is in dire need to finance the budget. In addition, the commercial banks will prefer lending to Government instead of the private sector thus affecting growth in the private sector.\\n\\nManagement explained that GoU has two options to handle redemptions. Firstly, it can opt for an outright settlement of these obligations and secondly, rollover. The first option is not feasible, as this will constrain the budget. Further to note, with the introduction of Primary Dealer Reforms in 2020, GoU no longer has a challenge of under subscriptions (since PDs are obligated to fully fund auctions).\\n\\nThe **UGX.6.7Tn** NDF in FY2020/21, was necessitated by the low tax revenue that was occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. After full re-opening of the economy, NDF for the subsequent FY was naturally reduced to **UGX.5.5Tn,** which was accordingly mobilized. GoU is implementing the DRMS which is envisaged to reduce on the fiscal deficit. Further to this, GoU is pursuing fiscal consolidation, evidenced by deliberate reduction in NDF for FY2022/23 and the medium term.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.7.4 The Cost to Government for using Private Placements - UGX.1.2Tn**\\n\\nSection 1.4 (C) of the Guidelines for selling Uganda Government Securities through Non- Calendar Auctions and Private Placement Mechanism 2019 provides that the use of non- calendar auctions and private placements shall be on a purely exceptional basis and as a last resort. This is intended to minimize the secondary bond market price distortions that may result from the off-calendar increased stock supply, and the potential subsequent impact on primary auctions and the cost of borrowing through increased rates.\\n\\nI observed that UGX.510.8Tn was borrowed from the domestic market on the 29 th June 2022 using a private placement. I noted that this domestic borrowing was outside the approved auction-calendar dates. I further noted that the use of private placements to raise funding attracted higher interest charges of UGX.1.2Tn due to absence of competition.

It was not practically possible to have raised these funds from the domestic market through the auction calendar.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI observed that among other challenges, the Treasury was facing cash flow constraints. The Treasury requested BoU to switch Bonds totalling to **UGX.0.9Tn** in two consecutive financial years (FY2020/21 and FY2021/22) which resulted into accumulation of accrued interest totalling to **UGX.1.184Tn** over a period of years.

It was further noted that in the same two financial years, the Treasury rolled over debt to a tune **UGX.14.6Tn** in domestic debt.\\n\\nManagement stated that in the recent past, MoFPED has carried out two bond switches. In FY2020/21, a successful switch was conducted (favourable yields) with advantages such as: increased the average maturity of the debt portfolio and increased liquidity of benchmark securities (deepens financial market). In FY2021/22, again, GoU was obliged to honour high redemptions. Practically, they had three options;\\n\\ni-  \\nto budget and retire this obligation (was feasible-GoU operated a deficit budget);\\n\\nii-  \\nlet BoU pay on their behalf and let her obligation became part of the accumulated reimbursements to BoU. This would not make any difference, because the Central bank charges GoU, interest equivalent to the prevailing market rates;\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.7.6 Debt to GDP Ratio**\\n\\nThe Debt to GDP ratio is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service provided). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a Country to pay both internal and external debt and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates to compensate for financing risk due to likely default or unnecessary debt extension.\\n\\nThough the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, the developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold.\\n\\nA re-computation of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a consistent linear growth over a period of five years as Debt to GDP grew by 21% from 31% to 52%. The graph below illustrates the movement;\\n\\n**Graph Showing Debt to GDP ratio**\\n\\n180 160 140 120\\n\\n100\\n\\n**Debt to GDP**\\n\\nGDP\\n\\nTotal debt  \\n80  \\nDebt/GDP  \\n60 51 52  \\n31 34 35 41  \\nExpon.

The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk factor of accumulation of unsustainable debt.\\n\\n---\\n\\nslightly above the 50% policy threshold by the end of FY2021/22 and to peak at 53.1% in FY2022/23, before gradually reducing to below 50% by the end of FY2025/26.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer should consider alternative ways of reducing dependence on debt while exploring avenues of enhancing revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures.\\n\\n**2.7.7 Interest to Total Revenue Ratio**\\n\\nThis benchmark shows the proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestically-raised component of the budget only. The table below shows the assessment of the benchmark over the years;\\n\\n**Table 11: Showing interest to total revenue ratio** Financial Total domestic Revenue Total Interest – % of Interest to Bench year – UGX.Tn UGX.Tn revenue mark** 2021/22 22.8 5.5 24.1 <12.5\\n\\n2020/21 20.2 3.1 15.4 <12.5 2019/20 17.5 2.5 14.2 <12.5 2018/19 17.1 2.0 11.71 <12.5 2017/18 15.2 1.9 12.73 <12.5\\n\\nIt has been established that the interest to revenue benchmark has been overwhelmingly breached as evidenced above. It has been noted that **24.1%** of the revenue being collected is going into servicing interest payments. This is gradually reducing the funds available for funding other critical Government expenditures.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to devise strategies of reducing the growth of interest expenditures at the same time increasing revenue mobilisation.\\n\\n**2.7.8 Use of Non-concessional loans for Budget support – UGX.4.5Tn**\\n\\nThe Government Medium Term Debt Strategy has for the past five financial years restricted non concessional/commercial loans to financing infrastructure and self - financing projects through on-lent agreements that have the capacity of generating non tax revenue to enable debt repayment. This has been done in the spirit of ensuring long term debt sustainability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 12: Showing non-concessional loans for budget support** Loan Id Purpose Date Last Debt Type Interest Interest Outstanding** **Signed Payment** Rate Rate Type Including Arrears (UGX Tn) 30.06.2022** 20910000 Prog. 02.06.2020 02.06.2027 Commercial 4.47 Euribor  \\n1.2 Support  \\nBanks  \\n20909000 Prog. 24.03.2020 25.03.2027 Commercial 4.45 Euribor  \\n1.1 Support  \\nBanks  \\n20931000 Prog. 13.09.2021 13.09.2031 Commercial 5.5 Euribor  \\n0.8 Support  \\nBanks  \\n20931000 Prog. 13.09.2021 13.09.2031 Commercial 5.72 Libor 6  \\n0.6 Support Banks Months Deposit  \\n20923000 Prog. 08.06.2021 11.06.2028 Commercial 4.75 Euribor  \\n0.8 Support\\n\\n**Source:** DMFAS/MoFPED\\n\\nBanks  \\n**Total** 4.5**\\n\\nIn the past, budget support has been financed by grants, domestic debt (i.e. T-bills and T- Bonds), concessional loans with very generous terms and internally generated revenue. Non- concessional debt financing will increase financial leverage and financial risk. It will reduce the government’s liquidity, given the fact that commercial loans do not give longer grace periods of debt repayment as compared to concessional loans. Commercial bank debt often has higher interest rates and contracting fees which is never a requirement for concessional loans. The country further runs a risk of losing its national key assets in the event of default.\\n\\nManagement explained that concessional financing is limited and Government has been forced to borrow from semi-concessional institutions to meet its liquidity obligations.\\n\\nManagement is advised to consider financing Budget support with loans that have concessional terms, to avoid high interest payments and very short grace periods.\\n\\n**2.7.9 Continued high Commitment Fees**\\n\\nCommitment fees are paid for debt that has been contracted but not yet disbursed. I performed a trend analysis of commitment fees over the past five years and noted that a total of UGX.359.5Bn was paid as commitment fees. There was a slight decline by 2% between the FY2020/21 and FY21/22, from UGX.79.1Bn to UGX.77.5Bn. The table below refers;\\n\\n**Table 13: Showing commitment fees**  \\n**Financial year Commitment fees Paid (UGX Bn)** Percentage charge**\\n\\n---\\n\\nHowever, **UGX.31.6Bn** of commitment fee payments was a result of a loan obtained for budget support in the year under review. Relatedly I noted that at the end of the financial year 2021/22, undisbursed loans stood at **UGX.15.6Tn.** Government’s failure to draw down and low absorption of contracted government debt continue to attract high commitment fees and affect service delivery.\\n\\nManagement explained that the Ministry is aware of the problem of payment of Commitment fees due to delays in signing of Agreements when Sectors and implementers of projects are not ready. Going forward, the Ministry will only sign financing Agreements when sectors are ready to implement the projects to avoid payment of commitment fees. In addition, emphasis is being made on ensuring that feasibility studies are conducted before projects are submitted to parliament.\\n\\nI advised Government to identify and resolve any bottlenecks hindering the smooth implementation of projects/programmes and activities so as to increase its loan/debt absorption rates.\\n\\n**2.8** CANCELLATION OF THE LOAN FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MUZIZI HYDROPOWER PLANT**\\n\\nIn the year 2016, the GoU signed financing agreements with the ADF and KFW to fund the construction of a hydropower plant in Muzizi the project was for the construction of a 45 MW Muzizi hydropower plant in western Uganda with the aim of improving the electricity supply to the growing economy and the households.\\n\\nIn my report of the FY 19/20, I pointed out the challenges of under absorption of funds for this project and in the report for FY 20/21, I further emphasized the losses associated with the failure to absorb the said loan.\\n\\nIn a letter dated 22 nd February 2022, the Minister sought to cancel the loan agreement entered into with KFW, to which KFW acknowledged and agreed to the cancellation of the loan. The table shows the details of the loans;\\n\\n**Table 14: Showing cancelled loans SN Loan particulars**\\n\\n1 Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant 2 Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant 3 KfW Grant Finance (Euros)  \\n**TOTAL**\\n\\n**Loan Amount (Euro** Date of signing** **Mn)**  \\n40  \\n25 November 2016 45  \\n09 December 2016 5.36  \\n22 September 2015 **90.36**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.9** REVIEW OF JINJA EXPRESS HIGHWAY PROJECT**\\n\\nKampala-Jinja Expressway Project Phase 1 agreement was entered into between the GOU and the African Development Bank for a total amount of **USD.229.5Mn** (equivalent to **UGX.0.863Tn).** The parties agreed to 0.25% (beginning 60 days after the date of the loan agreement) commitment fee and front end fees of 0.25% (not later than 60 days after the date of entry of the agreement.\\n\\nThe loan was secured to finance Phase 1 of the construction of 77Km Kampala- Jinja expressway project. Development of the first 35Kms from Kampala to Namagunga and the Kampala Southern Bypass is supposed to be completed by 2023.\\n\\nThe following Observations were noted;\\n\\n- In spite of the availability of the funds, the project had not commenced.\\n\\n- In the FY 20/21, no funds were drawn from this facility indicating the slowdown of work on the project. It was however noted that a total of **USD.0.8Mn (UGX.3Bn)** was paid to the lender as commission fees for the undisbursed funds as indicated in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 15: Showing commission fees paid** SN Description Amount Exchange Amount (USD) Rate\\\\` (UGX.Bn)** 1 Front End Fee –Kampala Jinja 573,675 3,570.57 2.1 Expressway Project  \\n2 …003201 Kampala – Jinja 251,982 3,550.43 0.9 Expressway 1  \\n**TOTAL 825,657 3**\\n\\nThis expenditure constitutes a nugatory expense considering that the funds are paid for no particular gain. The delays in project implementation impact on the economic and social development of the country. Besides the associated commitment fees are wasteful.\\n\\nManagement explained that the project execution has delayed because of protracted procurement processes by UNRA. This matter has been discussed with UNRA during portfolio reviews for ADB funded projects. In future, such scenarios will be addressed through advance procurement processes to ensure that projects are implemented as planned as soon as Financing Agreements are signed.\\n\\n---\\n\\nagreement with option to extend to 30 days before expiry of the date. The parties agreed for an interest rate of 3.7% to be charged on the disbursed amount per annum.\\n\\nI noted that a total of **UGX.67Bn** had been drawn by GoU from this facility since it came into effect.\\n\\nA review of the signed agreement against the Minutes of the National Economy Committee of parliament when approving the loan request by the MoFPED revealed that although the parliament authorized interest to be charged on the loan of 3.6% of the disbursed amount, the final loan agreement however indicated interest of 3.7%. The loan agreement condition on interest therefore contradicted what was approved by Parliament.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer stated that the Financing for the Meter Gauge Railway Line project is blended financing with tranche2 of **Euro 16.9Mn** being semi-concessional with a Maturity Period of 20 years, Grace period of 5 years, Interest of 2% p.a, Management Fees of 0.25% and Commitment Fees of 0.25% while Tranche 1 amounting to **Euro 9.1Mn** is highly concessional with a Maturity Period of 50 years, Grace period of 15 years, interest of 0.055%, Management Fees of 0.1% and Commitment Fees of 0.1% thus the financing was adequately negotiated as per the prevailing time. This is being handled in all current agreements.\\n\\nI advised Government to be more cautious in the acquisition of loans to ensure the terms of the loan agreement are consistent with parliamentary approvals.\\n\\n**2.11 CONCESSIONAL LOAN AGREEMENT TO FINANCE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE RAILWAYS SYSTEM IN UGANDA**\\n\\nIn a resolution of the Parliamentary Committee dated May 2021, the National Economic Committee (NEC) of Parliament approved the following facilities for the Kampala Meter Gauge railway project as shown in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 16: Showing approvals by NEC**  \\n**Lender**  \\n**Amount (UA) Mn** Amount (Euro.Mn)** African Development Fund 179.6 216.7 African Development Bank 69.9 84.4 Corporate Internationalization Fund of **Spain**  \\n26  \\n**TOTAL** 249.5 327.1\\n\\nSubsequently, the GoU entered into a facility agreement with the Spanish Government for a financial facility of **Euro 9,120,100** (equivalent to **UGX.36Bn)** as a concessional facility to finance the strategic consultant services for capacity building for the railways systems in Uganda. It was agreed by the parties that the drawdown deadline for the facility would be Sixty months from coming into effect of the agreement with an option to extend to 30 days before expiry of the date. The parties agreed on a fixed annual interest rate of 0.055% payable at 6 month intervals on all disbursed funds. The GOU would also be charged a Commission of 0.1% per year applied to all the amounts that have not been withdrawn during drawdown period, and would commence six (6) months after the agreement comes into force.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI noted that in a letter dated 20 th September 2021, Spain communicated that all conditions of the agreement had been met and as such, the loan became effective. In effect, the loan commenced attracting commission for non-withdrawal. I noted that no drawing had been made by the time of the audit in November 2022. There was also no evidence that any payments had been made in form of management commission yet. I further noted that in light of the fact that the loan became effective on 20 th September 2021, the GOU had an obligation to utilize the funds or continue to pay commission fees for the loan and risk a delay or failure of the project.\\n\\nThe delay in withdrawing the said funds by the GOU continues to accrue unnecessary charges of commissions to government. It also has the implication of slowing the progress of the projects.\\n\\nManagement explained that the financing Agreements for the ADF and ADB are now due for signature following the ADB Board Approval on 8 th December 2022.\\n\\nI advised Government to expedite the outstanding processes to enable utilization of the loan and mitigate further escalation of unnecessary charges in form of commissions.\\n\\n**2.12 FINANCING AGREEMENT FOR SUPPLY OF SOLAR PUMPING SYSTEMS IN THE MINISTRY OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (EURO.95.8Mn equivalent to UGX.381Bn)**\\n\\nA financing agreement between Government of Uganda (GoU) and the Export Credits Guarantee Department of UK (UKEF) was signed on 12 th February 2021 to support the project. The estimated project cost of the project was Euro.100 million. The total loan amount is **Euro 95.8Mn** (Equivalent to **UGX.381Bn)** with the GOU counterpart funding the project with 15% of the projected cost.\\n\\nA commercial Contract, for Design, Supply and Installation of Solar Powered Water Supply and Irrigation Systems was signed between GoU and a contractor on 3 rd July 2020. The contractor commenced works a year later, on 12 th July 2021 after receipt of the advance payment (5% of the GoU counterpart funding). The project is expected to end on 30 th June 2025.\\n\\nBy end of June 2022, the contractor had received **Euros.14Mn** (14%) of the Contract Sum, while the Consultant had received 27% of the contract Sum **(UGX.11.6Bn).** The second tranche for counterpart financing supposed to be disbursed in February was postponed to October 2022 due to resource constraints. However, in the same period the third tranche should be released.\\n\\n---\\n\\nfund or into some other public fund which is existing or is created for the purpose of the loan. Section 30(1) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, provides that all revenues or other money raised or received for the purpose of the Government, shall be paid into and shall form part of the Consolidated Fund.\\n\\nThe provision of the financing agreement in allowing an account not resident in Uganda to be construed as a public fund for purposes of receipt of government loan proceeds violates the Constitution and the PFMA. It also seeks to amend the provisions of the said laws.\\n\\nManagement explained that as part of the standard negotiation procedures for all Agreements, the Attorney General is involved from the beginning to the end until Clearance of the Financing Agreement is done. The Ministry has communicated to the Attorney General to advise on whether this constitutes a Public Fund within the provisions of Article 159(3) of the 1995 Constitution and Section 30(1) of the PFMA 2015.\\n\\nI advised Management to ensure that all provisions of the different financing agreements conform to the existing laws of the country.\\n\\n**2.13** REHABILITATION OF THE TORORO-GULU RAILWAY LINE**\\n\\nThe European Union and the Government of Uganda are supporting the development initiative for Northern Uganda through the rehabilitation of Tororo - Gulu railway line that commenced in March 2020 and is expected to be completed on the second half of 2023. In the Grant agreement signed on the 16 th December 2019 between the GOU and the EU, it was resolved that the total cost of the project would be **Euros.34.6Mn** (GoU **Euros.13.1Mn** and EU **Euros.21.5Mn)** respectively.\\n\\nI reviewed the contract implementation and noted the following;\\n\\n- Contrary to article 65.1 of the grant agreement, GOU defaulted on their contribution to payment of the contractor. This resulted into termination of the contract by the contractor. By the time of termination, **Euros.3.1Mn** was due to the contractor. As at 30 th August 2022, only 15.47% works had been completed. Article 65.3 states that in the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the contractor for any loss or damage the contractor may have suffered. The maximum amount shall be 10% of the contract price.\\n\\n- In a letter dated 24 th June 2022 and referenced UG/T-G-R/SOGETF/FIN/06-22/052, the Contractor, informed GOU of their notice of termination of the contract. This followed the contractor’s notice of suspension of works due to delayed payment. The contractor indicates that by the time of contract termination, the outstanding un-paid amount was totalling to **Euros.0.7Mn** (Equivalent to **UGX.2.5Bn)** in respect to the government portion.

Review of the Treasury Operations financial statements indicated that no contingent liability had been provided for/disclosed in respect to the out-standing claim.\\n\\n- In addition, I noted that after termination of the contract by the contractor, the contractor never handed over the demolished materials that were supposed to be used for reconstruction of the railway line, besides, evidence from supervising consultant indicated that 136,416 railway items equivalent to **Euro 3.08 Mn** had been stolen. Similarly, although the Contracting Authority had made 30% advance payment to the contractor amounting to **Euro 11.8 Mn** by the time of termination of the contract only **Euro 2.95Mn** had been recovered with the balance **Euro 8.85Mn** not yet recovered. Delayed reconciliation with the contractor may lead to loss of public resources.  \\nThe Accounting Officer explained that this is an issue that is being handled following procedures of closure of Contract at Termination. The Final Account shall detail what is payable to the Contractor at the time of termination less what the Contractor owes the Client including losses of Inventory as determined by the inspections mentioned above.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.14 PLANNING FOR CAPITALISATION OF INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS**\\n\\nIn the Financial Institutions (revision of minimum capital Requirements) Instrument, 2022, it was provided that for a person to transact in the financial institution business in the capacity of a bank, they should have a minimum paid-up capital of not less than six million currency points (equivalent to **UGX.120Bn)** by December 2022 invested initially in such liquid assets in Uganda as the central bank may approve.\\n\\nThe instrument further provides that a person proposing to transact a financial institution business in the capacity of a bank shall have a minimum paid-up capital of not less than seven million five hundred thousand currency points (equivalent to **UGX.150Bn)** by 30 th June 2024 invested initially in such liquid assets in Uganda as the central bank may approve.\\n\\nI noted that the GoU has interests in four financial institutions as listed in table below;\\n\\n**Table 18: Capitalization requirements**  \\n**SN Financial Institution** Reported paid- Requirement 31 Requirement** **up capital (UGX December 2022** 30 June 2024 Bn) (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn)** 1 Housing Finance Bank Limited 122. -2 28 2 Tropical Bank Limited 88.2 31.8 61.8 3 Post Bank Limited 98. 22 52 **Total 51.8 141.8**\\n\\nI noted that two of the financial institutions require additional funding of capital totaling **UGX.51.8Bn** by the year ending 31 st December 2022 as indicated in table above. There is therefore a need of additional funding by GoU especially in the case of financial situations in which GoU has majority shareholding. In the case of Post Bank limited, there would be a need for an additional investment of **UGX.22Bn** to be compliant to operate as a bank as of 31 st December 2022. In the case of M/S Tropical Bank Limited, the GoU will have to liaise with its other shareholder to secure a total of **UGX.31.8Bn** to be compliant by 31 st December 2022.\\n\\nIn addition, GoU would have to ensure that in the next financial year, it plans for capital injection in all the three banks of a total of **UGX.141.8Bn** to ensure that the banks are compliant as of 30 th June 2024.\\n\\nFailure to plan for the capital requirements for the different financial institutions may result in the banks not being compliant and therefore not authorized to operate as banks.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGeneral, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.\\n\\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n**Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements**\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda.  \\nThe Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process. **Auditor\\'s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements**\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the government’s internal control.\\n\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\'s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor\\'s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor\\'s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor\\'s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n**Other Reporting Responsibilities**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation**\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of Government with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.\\n\\nThe material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;\\n\\n**2.15 MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INVESTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda (GoU) is making large investments in Information Technology (IT) systems because of the tremendous benefits that IT can bring to its operations and services. One of the key programmes of NDPIII 2020/21-2024/25 is Digital Transformation, in which Government of Uganda aims to increase Information, Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use of digital services for enhancing social and economic development.\\n\\nAs a result of national prioritization of ICT, I undertook a thematic audit covering three financial years’ expenditure (2019/20 to 2021/22) to scrutinise the management of IT Investments across Government. The overall objective was to assess whether the IT investments in Government are strategically aligned, managed appropriately and focused on achieving the NDP III objective. The procedures undertaken covered: planning and budgeting; procurement, utilization, maintenance and disposal of IT systems; governance, and financial reporting.\\n\\nI reviewed a sample of 68 MDAs with IT budgets of **UGX.968Bn,** for the three years in respect of acquisition and implementation of IT systems and equipment of which **UGX.894Bn** was warranted, as summarised in the table 19 below;\\n\\n**Table 19: Showing budget allocations for IT Systems and Equipment** Financial Budget Warrants/Release Variance Year (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn)** 2021/2022 331.754 312.233 19.521 2020/2021 357.098 331.691 25.407 2019/2020 279.017 249.989 29.028 **967.869 893.913 73.956**\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **No Observation Recommendation** |<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| During the audit of the sampled MDAs, I observed the following; |<|<| Guidelines, prioritise |  \\n|^||<|<| systems maintenance |  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 81% (95 out of 118) of IT systems/equipment procured by 42 |<|<| and upgrades to |  \\n|^| MDAs lacked clearance from NITA-U. |<|<| preserve the integrity |  \\n|^||<|<| and availability of |  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 52 IT systems/equipment acquired by 15 MDAs were not |<|<| data and systems, |  \\n|^| optimally utilized as envisaged. |<|<| and to this effect, |  \\n|^||<|<| formal procedures |  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 24 Systems acquired at a cost above UGX.200Mn by 9 MDAs |<|<| should be put in place |  \\n|^| were not approved by Solicitor General as required by law. |<|<| to guide the process. |  \\n|^||<|<||  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 I reviewed inception reports for sampled MDAs and noted that |<|<|<|  \\n|^| 44 IT projects with a total cost of UGX.34.8Bn, were not |<|<|<|  \\n|^| implemented within the contractual timelines. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 38 IT Systems costing UGX.55Bn implemented in 15 MDAs did |<|<|<|  \\n|^| not meet the user requirements and the users not trained on |<|<|<|  \\n|^| the usage of the systems. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 I noted that 29 IT systems acquired by 13 MDAs were not |<|<|<|  \\n|^| owned by the MDAs, as there was no formal handover of the |<|<|<|  \\n|^| systems and/ or source codes. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| \\uf0b7 37 systems at 14 MDAs that hold data and information that is |<|<|<|  \\n|^| required and/or used by various MDAs, were found not |<|<|<|  \\n|^| integrated. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| Non-compliance may lead to duplication of acquisition, procurement |<|<|<|  \\n|^| of non-compatible solutions and equipment; and general deviation |<|<|<|  \\n|^| from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service |<|<|<|  \\n|^| delivery. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n| I advised the Accounting Officers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and procedures to ensure  data availability  and integrity preservation in the event that some IT assets are decommissioned.  In addition, the Board of  Survey recommendations should be adhered to. 1.1 **Disposal and Decommissioning of ICT Assets** 15.11.1 of the TIs, 2017, PPDA Act, 2003 (as amended) and PPDA Regulations, 2014 together with the PFMA 2015, require MDAs and LGs to efficiently and transparently dispose assets as recommended. I noted that most MDAs are not disposing off IT assets as per the recommendations of the respective Boards of Survey. disposal of IT assets leads to a further diminution in value and loss to the government. In addition, a lack of appropriate policies may lead to the loss and misuse of critical data. Besides, hazardous materials from ICT equipment may be harmful to the environment.

Registration and certification of IT professionals and IT Institutions without enabling regulation**\\n\\nSection 5(i) NITA-U Act 2009, provides for the functions of the Authority to include; regulation of the information technology in Uganda in order to ensure its effective promotion and development. In addition, the Authority is required to act as an authentication centre for information technology training in Uganda in conjunction with the Ministry responsible for Education. However, I noted the following;\\n\\n- The Authority is currently registering professionals and the training institutions without prescribed regulations and standards. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since 2017; 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while the 11 are expired.\\n\\n- The Authority has service provider regulations but they lacked timelines for the applicants to get certified. There is a risk that the potential clients to the Authority continue to operate even beyond their valid period. From a sample examined, I\\n\\n---\\n\\nobserved that seven (7) companies were providing services to MDAs without certification by NITA-U.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, the registration and certification without enabling regulations is irregular.\\n\\nThe NITA-U Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs advised that a regulation for IT Professionals would not suffice in governing and/or regulating the IT Profession. They recommended the development of an ICT Professionals Bill which will upon approval, become an Act that guides the regulation and development of the IT Profession just like the other professions (Lawyers, Engineers, Accountants) etc. The development of the IT Professionals Bill is being spearheaded by the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to strengthen and align NITA-U in the delivery of its mandate by developing and implementing all the required regulations, laws and standards.\\n\\n**2.16 MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC LAND BACKGROUND**\\n\\nPublic land management is the process by which public land is put to good effect. It focuses on establishing and sustaining an optimum balance of use, conservation and development of resources in harmony with the values and needs of society.\\n\\nVision 2040 prioritizes Land as a crucial resource for provision of public utilities and calls for sustainable land use and management, as one of the fundamentals to be strengthened in order to harness the country’s abundant opportunities. Whereas Government owns vast land comprising numerous properties used by government agencies to perform their functions in the delivery of services to Citizens, many government entities have had challenges in management of public land. These include; inadequate record keeping, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, lack of land titles, uncoordinated and unstandardized approach to acquisition of land for public use, among others.\\n\\nSubsequent to these challenges and others I have reported upon over time, I undertook a compliance study in 57 selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments (LGs), over a period of four years, to assess whether Government had efficiently and effectively managed public land for better service delivery to the Citizens, and in accordance with the existing Iegal and reporting frameworks. The following were my summary findings and recommendations;\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that the size, cost and purpose for proposed land acquisitions are included in the respective strategic plans of entities to enable attainment of NDP III objectives and guide effective preparation of annual entity budgets.\\n\\n**2.16.2 Budgeting, funding, and absorption of funds, for land acquisition**\\n\\nFifteen (15) entities included land acquisition in their annual budgets for the period under review, while four (04) entities acquired land without budgets. The fifteen (15) entities budgeted for acquisition of 17,831 hectares of land at a cost of UGX.483.6Bn; the entities were availed UGX.447.5Bn (93%), and acquired 25,786 hectares at a total cost of UGX.435.3Bn (including a mischarge of UGX.1.74Bn which was not budgeted for land acquisition) leaving a sum of UGX.14.Bn (3% of availed funds) un-utilised.\\n\\nHowever, Ministry of Defence which acquired 7,562.07 hectares at a cost of UGX.84.64Bn did not indicate the land size in its budgets. I further noted that four (4) entities acquired 5.06 hectares of land at a total of UGX.20.47Bn without budgeting (both size and amount).\\n\\nSeven (7) entities received inadequate funding, having budgeted for UGX.333.613Bn and received UGX.297.531Bn (89%)) for land acquisition in the period under review. I further noted that Wakiso and Oyam DLGs diverted a sum of UGX.0.354Bn from funds for land acquisition in the period under review.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to;\\n\\n- Liaise with PS/ST to ensure that funds appropriated for acquisition of land are availed.\\n- Ensure that availed funds for land acquisition are utilised for the intended purpose.\\n\\n**2.16.3 Compliance of Land Acquisition with the relevant Laws**\\n\\nI noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, eight (8) entities acquired a total of 3,937.336 hectares at a cost of UGX.79.77Bn directly without competitive participation. The procurement methods used by six (6) entities in the acquisition of 1,666.016 hectares costing UGX.62.83Bn were not approved by their Contracts Committees. I further noted that two (2) entities commenced acquisition of 319.6 hectares of land costing UGX.6.72Bn without confirmation availability of funding. In addition, seven (7) entities acquired 15,760.82 hectares with a value above the UGX200Mn threshold each, at a total cost of UGX.64.76Bn without clearance from the Attorney General.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.16.4 Involvement of Uganda Land Commission**\\n\\nI noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, five (5) entities acquired 1,669.84 hectares at a cost of UGX.45.9Bn prior to notifying the Uganda Land Commission to enable effective public land management, including advising on availability of other options. I also observed that there was no coordination by the various government entities with ULC in regard to land acquisition.\\n\\nI advised Government entities to coordinate with ULC when acquiring Public land to ensure that before acquisition, all available options through Uganda Land Commission are exhausted.\\n\\n**2.16.5 Valuation by the Chief Government Valuer**\\n\\nOut of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, two (2) entities procured 1.96 hectares at a cost of UGX.1.6Bn without obtaining Chief Government Valuer (CGV) valuation. I also noted that the CGV took more than twenty (20) working days in approving consultants’ valuation reports on land government projects contrary to the statutory timelines.\\n\\nDelayed valuation of Land by the CGV may result into increase in project costs, delayed commencement of infrastructure projects which affects loan absorption rates, and increases commitment charges arising from undisbursed loans from multilateral and bilateral lenders.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Lands to ensure that approval of consultant’s valuation reports on government projects are always fast-tracked to avoid project delays and increasing liability to government.\\n\\n**2.16.6 Registration and Titling of Land**\\n\\nI noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, forty-two (42) entities did not have land titles for a total of 4,398 pieces of land comprising twenty-six (26) entities which had 1,638 pieces of land measuring approximately 80,038.88 hectares and sixteen (16) entities held 2,760 pieces with unknown land sizes. I also noted that seven (7) entities which held 81 pieces of land measuring 12,521.1 hectares had land titles for all the pieces of land held. The anomalies were attributed to the following; inadequate funds to process land titles and land having been donated by individuals who passed on without transferring title to the entity, delays by MZOs to effect registration and transfers, continuous acquisitions of land and delays in the survey process.\\n\\n---\\n\\nand URA explained that Universities were body corporate with a right to own and manage their own land.\\n\\nI advised the Attorney General to give a general guidance to corporate government entities in regard to the custody of entity land with ULC.\\n\\n**2.16.8 Recording and Reporting of Government Land**\\n\\nI noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 20 entities did not record a total of 636 pieces of land measuring approximately 19,275.25 hectares in their respective Land registers rendering it difficult to confirm the completeness of their Land inventory. I also noted that 26 entities did not record a total of 1,355 pieces of land measuring approximately 21,603.08 hectares of land in their respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non- produced assets in the financial statements.\\n\\nThe non-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land which could easily lead to loss and /or misstatement of the non-produced asset in the financial statements.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to ensure that the asset module under the GFMIS is functioning properly. In addition, I advised the respective Accounting Officers to update both the fixed asset registers and the asset module under the GFMIS.\\n\\n**2.16.9 Utilization of Government Land for Delivery of Service**\\n\\nI noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 29 entities did not utilise a total of 258 pieces of land measuring approximately 10,066.8 hectares of land held by 30th June 2022. Non- utilization and use of land for unapproved use defeats the purpose for acquisition which may affect Government’s ability to achieve its intended objectives and deliver services its citizens.\\n\\nIn addition, thirty-four (34) entities had 434 pieces of land encroached upon, of these, 182 pieces measured approximately 61,207.04 hectares. Ninety-six 96 of the 182 pieces of land cost UGX.134.4Bn, while 252 of the 434 pieces had unknown measurements. Land encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the affected land for the intended purposes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nrealization of ground rent arrears or development of land as per lease agreement. In addition, Seven (7) entities without mandate to lease out government land granted thirty one (31) leases.\\n\\nI advised the respective Accounting Officers of ULC, other MDAs and Local Governments to ensure that comprehensive lease registers are maintained for proper management of leased land.\\n\\n**2.16.11** Allocation of Land by District Land Boards (DLB)**\\n\\nI noted that there was no comprehensive database of Public Land by the DLB’s. As a result, two (2) District Land Boards (DLBs) allocated four (4) pieces of land which were not under their jurisdiction.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to ensure strict adherence to the internal controls and compliance with land allocation procedures.\\n\\n**2.16.12** Management of Land outside Uganda**\\n\\nThe Land Act mandates the ULC to hold and manage any land acquired by the Government abroad, except that the Commission may delegate the management of such land to Uganda’s Missions abroad. I noted that ULC neither had information concerning government land abroad nor delegated management of such land to Uganda’s Missions abroad. There is a risk of mismanagement of government land abroad.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage and liaise with other Government agencies to ensure that the provisions in the law in regard to management of government land abroad are fulfilled.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn F.

Muwanga **AUDITOR GENERAL**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.0.** REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022**\\n\\n**THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion**\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Local Governments, which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying Consolidated statements for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments for the year ended 30 th June, 2021 are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with Section 52(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n**Basis for Opinion**\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report.

I **Payment of salary using wrong salary scales and salary steps/ levels/notches** **d)** B – a (6) & (7) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2021 provides that the Salary Structure shall indicate salaries attached to each salary scale in the public service, hence, salaries should be paid correctly, promptly and as a lump sum in accordance with the approved salary structure for the Public Service. Section (B - c) 1 of Public Service Standing Orders, 2021 provides that a public officer who holds a post graded in a salary scale with incremental levels, shall receive annual increments up to the maximum of the salary scale. My comparison of the base pay as per IPPS payroll registers with the base pay as per salary structure for 2021/22 revealed that, 1,264 employees in 26 LGs were paid on the wrong scales leading to over payments of UGX.532,949,259 and under payments of UGX.886,806,364. 28,172 employees in 26 LGs were paid on wrong of of steps/levels/notches  UGX.2,386,682,931  UGX.2,652,787,176.

Furthermore, section B-a (18) requires that a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations may be deducted from his or her salary in accordance with the regulations. In addition, section 10.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralized salary processing 2014 required MALGS to pay deductions to the respective beneficiaries and that no arrears in respect to payroll deductions would be accepted.

I noted that in 43 LGs, Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners were paid gratuity of UGX.1,352,773,796 which was not subjected to PAYE computations and deductions on the IPPS leading to a loss of tax revenue of UGX.363,098,974 to government. Details are in **Appendix 1 g.** In 9 LGs Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners’ gratuity of UGX.439,505,102 was subjected to PAYE manually and UGX.112,440,114 was deducted and remitted to Uganda Revenue Authority. This practice complicates payroll management in LGs and creates inconsistencies where some LGs deduct the PAYE and others don’t. Details are in **Appendix 1 g.** The Accounting officers explained that computations were not activated in the IPPS to automatically deduct PAYE from Political leaders and commissioners’ Gratuity. My interaction with MoPS revealed that the error arose from the failure to distinguish between untaxable gratuity as per the Pensions Act and other taxable terminal benefits. MoPS has engaged the IPPS developer who required additional funding to rectify the error.

I recomputed the pension and gratuity benefits and noted that 37 LGs did not accurately compute pension and gratuity benefits for 423 pensioners.

Additionally, adjustment of scales and subscales at the point of capturing pension and gratuity by the Accounting Officers was not guided by MoPS. My interaction with MoPS revealed that there is a provision for the Accounting Officers to rectify retiree’s base pay on the IPPS towards the date of retirement for which they are either not aware or are reluctant to adjust. |<|<|<|<|<| was also advised |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| to guide LG |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| Accounting |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| Officers on how to |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| rectify  the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| retiree’s pension |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| information in the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| system  before |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| computation is |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| made. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| **Access and deletion from the payroll** Delayed access of newly recruited or transferred staff** **3.1.6 a)** |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| **to the payroll** B-a (11) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 states that the Accounting Officer shall ensure that the Public officer accesses the payroll within four (4) weeks from the date of assumption of duty. I noted that 4,341 newly recruited/ transferred employees delayed to access payroll with the worst delays ranging from 5 to 12 months.  As a result, by close of the financial year, 1,746 staff had not been paid a total of UGX.2,802,520,509. Details are in **Appendix 1 i.** Failure to access payroll affects staff livelihood and leads to un- necessary accumulation of arrears. Accounting Officers attributed this to challenges with setting-up staff in the IPPS by MoPS because the process is not fully decentralised for which the LGs have no control. During my interaction with MoPS, the PS attributed the delay to recruitments outside the approved structure that necessitates verification and subsequent clearance. Section The |<|<|<|<|<| I advised MoPS to |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| ensure that the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| bottlenecks  in |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| recruitment are |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| resolved and that |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| verification and |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| subsequent |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| clearance  of |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| recruited staff is |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| done in the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| shortest  time |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<| possible. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| **b)** Delayed access to the pension payroll** 5.1 of establishment notice no. 1 of 2020 requires responsible officers to initiate and complete the processing of retirement benefits within six months to the mandatory Paragraph |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **SN Observation Recommendation** |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| retirement date.

I however noted that 1,019 new pensioners/beneficiaries in 65 LGs delayed to access pension payroll, with some delays ranging from 50 to 110 months. As a result, UGX.1,380,739,357 was not paid. Details are in **Appendix 1 i.** Failure to access pension payroll affects pensioners’ livelihood and also leads to accumulation of pension arrears. While non- removal of transferred staff affects the releasing LGs as replacements cannot access the payroll until the transferred staff have been discontinued. The Accounting Officers attributed this to challenges with setting-up pensioners in the IPPS by MoPS because the process is not fully decentralised for which the LGs have no control. Most Accounting Officers had hopes that the introduction of HCM will most likely address the issue. interaction with MoPS indicated that this is still a challenge and as a stop gap measure, the Accounting Officers are advised to bring cases of un-validated staff to the attention of MoPS for follow up with NIRA.

Details are in **Appendix** |<|^|  \\n|^| **1 i.** |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| Delayed removal of staff from payroll resulted into financial loss |<|^|  \\n|^| to government. |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| The Accounting Officer attributed some of the delays to staff |<|^|  \\n|^| who had not been validated before decentralisation of payroll |<|^|  \\n|^| making the removal process difficult. Some of the delays were |<|^|  \\n|^| attributed to inconsistences in dates of birth in IPPS and |<|^|  \\n|^| National IDs. Going forward, the introduction of HCMS, will most |<|^|  \\n|^| likely resolve this issue. |<|^|  \\n|^||<|^|  \\n|^| My interaction with MoPS indicated that this is still a challenge |<|^|  \\n|^| and as a stop gap measure, the Accounting Officers are advised |<|^|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **SN Observation Recommendation** |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| to bring cases of un-validated staff to the attention of MoPS for follow up with NIRA.

By, the final payroll should be mapped onto the interface to show the same data. I compared the detailed payroll register reports (MoPS) with the interface files from the Core FTP (MoFPED) and noted variances of UGX.28,347,479,053 in 107 LGs. Details are in **Appendix 1 j.** **Category** Salaries Pension Gratuity Total and **Number employees/Pensioners** **of Amount** 10,504 25 10,529 27,545,118,941 802,360,112 28,347,479,053 I further noted that some employees captured on the payroll and uploaded onto the Core FTP system did not appear in the interface files prompting the Accounting Officers to include them manually. This has created an opportunity for manipulation of salary funds thus leading to over/under payments. The Accounting Officers explained that the LGs had no control over the above, since Core FTP system is controlled by MoFPED. During my interaction with MoFPED, the Accountant General indicated that the Accounting Officers were permitted to make adjustments to rectify possible errors on the payroll without necessarily abusing the system. The Accountant General further explained that the window for making adjustments was deactivated after the audit. **3.1.7 Inconsistencies between interface files and payroll registers** Section |<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| **3.1.8** Payments of salaries, pension & gratuity off the IPPS** |<|<|<|<|<||  \\n| 4.5 of establishment notice no. 2 of 2019 requires the responsible officer to pay for only salaries, pension and gratuity processed through IPPS.

Uganda Consumer Lenders’ Association/ Uganda Bankers Association (UCLA/UBA) contracted Payroll Consults Africa (PCA) to manage employee deductions on their behalf using the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS). I reviewed employee payroll deductions (non-statutory) and the PDMS records (active deductions report and my approvals) and observed the following; \\uf0b7 **Letters of undertaking or Consent** 4.2 (b) of the guidelines of managing salary deductions on the Government payroll, 2014 states that as part of the due diligence process, the credit lending institutions and banks will seek for a letter of undertaking from the Accounting Officer/employer or a designated officer confirming that the officer is a bona fide Government employee indicating his or her positions in the MDA/LG, payment details, terms of appointment and other details that may be prescribed by the lending institution. In addition, only deductions consented by employees in writing should be submitted to MoPS (employer) for timely monthly payroll processing or as advised by the employer. I observed that MoPS deducted UGX.20,792,707,030 from 15,002 staff in 44 HLGs on behalf of UCLA/UBA without letters of undertaking or consent as a prerequisite of approval of the deductions. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** **3.1.9** Management of deductions by UCLA/UBA** Government Section |<|<|<|<| through  MoPS should consider revisiting the MoU with UCLA/UBA with a view of streamlining the management of deductions. In the meantime,  the role of coding and decoding  of deductions should revert  the respective Accounting Officers. to Government |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n\\n\\nThe and My\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **SN** | **Observation** |<|<|<|<|<| **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|| Loans/savings not supported by letters of under- taking/consent may lead to; unauthorized deductions and lack of assurance/guarantee to lending institutions which may limit access to loan services and affects the livelihoods of civil servants. The Accounting Officer explained that this was an oversight and promised to keep copies of letters of undertaking and consent letters in the subsequent years. I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that letters of undertaking are duly prepared, signed by the bank and a copy retained on the staff personnel file for ease of reference. \\uf0b7 **Deduction past the deduction end date** observed that MoPS deducted UGX. 1,458,405,180 relating to 2,143 employees in 83 LGs past the end date on behalf of UCLA/UBA. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** Deductions past the end date result into financial loss to the affected staff. \\uf0b7 **Unrealistic loan end dates** noted that unrealistic loan end dates for 2,729 employees in 69 LGs with the worst ranging from ranging from 11 to 5,642 years. In the year under review, UGX.4,745,884,699 had been deducted from these employees. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** The above end dates are unrealistic and cast doubt on the integrity of the PDMS system controlled by PCA. This has led to continuous deductions from staff and there are possibilities of making deductions from staff without running loans. \\uf0b7 **Unapproved loan deductions by Accounting Officer in the PDMS** I I I observed that UCLA/UBA deducted UGX.8,885,902,311 from 8,468 staff in 95 LGs without approval of the Accounting Officers from the PDMS contrary to Section 2.1.2 & 2.1.4 of the service agreement. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** This creates opportunities to misappropriate funds through making fictitious deductions as well as over deductions. In addition, UGX.1,643,636,038 was deducted by UCLA/UBA from 8,756 staff over and above the approved amounts by the Accounting Officers in 68 LGs. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** |<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **SN Observation Recommendation** |<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| This resulted into financial loss to the affected staff. “Active” deductions report and “my approvals” report in the PDMS should have consistent deduction amounts to give confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the system. A comparison of the “active deductions” and “my approvals” reports in the PDMS revealed that there were variances in deduction amounts. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** Lack of integrity of the system creates opportunities for manipulation of the deduction which could result into financial loss to the affected employees. Details are in **Appendix 1 k.** The Accounting Officers explained that entities had no control over the challenges above in the management of non-statutory deductions in the PDMS system by UCLA/UBA. The Accounting Officers further explained that the issues would be resolved if the LGs do not have rights for coding and decoding of deductions. **System** \\uf0b7 **Reliability of the Payroll Deduction Management** |<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|  \\n| **3.1.10** | **Use of wrong formula to compute statutory deductions** |<|<||  \\n||^|<|<| I advised MoPs to |  \\n|^| Section 22 1(d) of the Income Tax Act as amended by |<|<| engage  the |  \\n|^| Amendment Act of 2008 provides that for the purpose of |<|<| Attorney General |  \\n|^| ascertaining the chargeable income of a person for a year of |<|<| to have the above |  \\n|^| income, Local Service Tax paid by an individual should be an |<|<| contradiction |  \\n|^| allowable deduction. |<|<| resolved. |  \\n|^||<|<||  \\n|^| The Local Governments (Amendment) (No. 2) Act of 2008 |<|<|<|  \\n|^| defined “take-home salary” as gross salary after deducting |<|<|<|  \\n|^| income tax in the form of Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and |<|<|<|  \\n|^| prescribed the rates of local service tax in respect of |<|<|<|  \\n|^| persons in gainful employment and earning a monthly take- |<|<|<|  \\n|^| home salary. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| I noted a contradiction between the Income Tax Act and the |<|<|<|  \\n|^| Local Government Act in regard to computation of PAYE and |<|<|<|  \\n|^| LST. The contradictions result from the Income Tax treating LST |<|<|<|  \\n|^| as an allowable deduction when computing PAYE while the Local |<|<|<|  \\n|^| Government Act treats PAYE as an allowable deduction when |<|<|<|  \\n|^| computing LST. |<|<|<|  \\n|^||<|<|<|  \\n|^| Consequently, the contradiction has resulted to over deduction |<|<|<|  \\n|^| of PAYE of UGX.3,040,220,504 and under deduction of |<|<|<|  \\n|^| UGX.2,387,243,619 from 75,094 employees in 96 LGs.

If the government entity does not have title to the land, the entity shall not be considered to have control (the title of government land is supposed to be kept with the Uganda Land Commission).  Section 49 of the Land Act Cap 227 further requires the Uganda Land Commission to hold and manage all the land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government including land acquired by the Government abroad. noted that out of the 631 pieces held by the 12 sampled entities of which 348 pieces measured 2384.78 hectares and 283 pieces had undefined measurements, 6 entities did not transfer 102 pieces of land measuring approximately 676.253 hectares into the custody of the Uganda Land Commission.

Furthermore Instruction 10.12.4 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires all fixed asset acquired to be captured in the fixed asset module of the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS)-IFMS. noted that out of the 631 pieces held by the 12 sampled entities of which 348 pieces measured 2384.78 hectares and 283 pieces had undefined measurements, 9 entities did not record a total of 583 pieces of land measuring approximately 1944.63 hectares in their respective Land registers rendering it difficult to confirm the completeness of their Land inventory. Details are in **Appendix 2 d.** also noted that 10 entities did not record a total of 603 pieces of land measuring approximately 2234.98 hectares in their respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. Details are in **Appendix 2 e.** lack of an updated land register was mainly attributed to the absence of a reconciled position between land acquired by the lower local governments and the various departments in the district while the failure to update the GFMIS was attributed to non-functionality of the GFMIS system and valuation non-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land and could lead to misstatement of the non- produced asset in the statement of financial position and in the summary statement of stores and other assets (physical assets).

However, the natural progression is to move from Cash basis through modified cash and modified accrual and eventually full accrual basis of accounting and the Accountant General revises guidelines from time to time to facilitate this transition. Furthermore, the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the latest guidance provided in the Financial Reporting Template.\\n\\n- A review of the Financial Reporting Guide and Financial reporting Template is in progress and the above will be harmonised.\\n\\nThe Accountant General was advised to expedite the revision of the Financial Reporting Guidelines and Templates.\\n\\n**3.4** Consolidation of Local Authorities with different accounting bases**\\n\\n- Government is in the process of transiting from modified cash basis of Accounting to Accrual basis of Accounting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- While the transition is being done, necessary adjustments and disclosures are done in order to comply with the provisions of PFMA 2015 of having Consolidated Financial Statements of Local Government.\\n\\nThese adjustments will cease once all the entities (Municipals and DLGs) comply with the accrual basis of Accounting, which is the ultimate goal.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to consider revising the Treasury Instructions and Financial reporting guideline to include guidance on the consolidation of financial statements prepared on different bases of accounting.\\n\\n**3.5** Management of YLP and UWEP in Local Governments**\\n\\nYouth Livelihood Program (YLP) and Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) commenced in the FYs 2013/14 and 2015/16 respectively with aim of providing affordable credit through an interest-free revolving fund.\\n\\nI reviewed the progress reports of various LGs data obtained from the MoGLSD as at 30 th June 2022 and noted the following;\\n\\n- Under YLP the recovery rate was only 23% of the amount due as at 30 th June The table below refers.

Previous OAG audit reports on budget performance have also revealed significant weaknesses that have affected the credibility of the LG budgets; these include diversion/mischarge, revenue underperformance, under absorption and implementation of off-budget activities, among others.\\n\\nAlthough there has been an improvement in the quantification of activities and the preparation of performance reports, I identified areas that need improvement to make the planning processes better, improve performance, credibility of future budgets and service delivery.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in the individual reports that have been issued separately;\\n\\n**3.6.1 Approval of budgets by Parliament without corresponding strategic plans**\\n\\nRegulation 26(1) of the National Planning Authority (NPA) [development of Plans] Regulations requires entities to submit five-year development plans for certification before approval to ensure that strategic plans are well aligned to the National Development Plans.\\n\\nBy the end of the FY2021/22, only 80 (47%) out of 169 LGs had their strategic plans certified by NPA. By the time of writing this report, NPA had not yet certified strategic plans for 89 (53%) LGs that had submitted, as shown below;\\n\\n**STATUS OF APPROVAL OF STRATEGIC PLANS BY NPA**\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI noted that Parliament approved budgets for 169 LGs in the FY 2020/21 and 89 LGs in the FY 2021/22 without the corresponding certification of strategic plans by NPA. Details are in **appendix 4 a.**\\n\\nAs a result, some of the Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AW&Bs) and therefore the activities implemented in the FY 2021/22 may not be consistent with the NDP III, which may hinder the attainment of the development goals, objectives and targets set by the country.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the above to delays by NPA to review and give feedback on the strategic plans, compounded by lack of training and technical support from NPA and MoFPED during the development of the strategic plans.\\n\\nMy interaction with the PSST, revealed that the change from sector to programmatic approach led to delayed issuance of the NDP III implementation plan by NPA to LGs thus affecting the preparation and approval of the strategic plans.\\n\\nI advised NPA to expedite the issuance of NDP III implementation plan and to build capacity of planners in the government entities to minimize delays in the preparation and approval of strategic plans.\\n\\n**3.6.2 Revenue performance**\\n\\n169 LGs budgeted to receive a total of UGX.5,995,310,337,537 but realized only UGX.5,426,900,787,092 (91%), leading to a shortfall of UGX.568,409,550,445 (9%). The performance of each revenue source is summarised in the table below:\\n\\n**Table 24: Local Government revenue performance**  \\n**Revenue Source**  \\n**Approved Budget - Warrants - UGX Variance - UGX** %age** **UGX** performance**\\n\\nLocal Revenue 223,518,772,109 131,349,888,815 92,168,883,294 59% Central Government grants 4,944,460,827,948 4,833,248,994,175 111,211,833,773 98%\\n\\n---\\n\\nLG Revenue Performance 6,000,000,000,000  \\n5,000,000,000,000  \\n4,000,000,000,000  \\n3,000,000,000,000  \\n2,000,000,000,000  \\n1,000,000,000,000\\n\\n0  \\nLocal Revenue Central Government Transfers received External Assistance grants from other  \\ngovernment units\\n\\nApproved Budget warrants\\n\\nGenerally, LGs are heavily dependent on the central government grants which contribute 98% of the LG total funding.\\n\\nLocal revenue performance, where 148 HLGS did not collect UGX.92,168,883,294 (41%) affected activities for which local revenue funding was earmarked. Details are in **appendix 4 a.**\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the shortfall in local revenue collection to the effects of COVID 19 on markets, trading licenses, hotels tax and royalties.\\n\\nOther than the local revenue source, the LGs had no control over the performance of other revenue sources, which affected the implementation/ payment for the following activities;\\n\\n- Council allowances and other council activities.\\n- Funding of some gazetted PDM SACCOs and the recruitment of parish chiefs\\n- URF road activities under routine mechanised and periodic maintenance.\\n- Health service activities, including immunisation, treatment of Malaria and Tuberculosis.\\n\\n- MoLG and Local Government Finance Commission should expedite the roll out of Integrated Revenue Administration System (IRAS) in all LGs to improve revenue assessment, collection and reporting, which will enhance local revenue performance.\\n\\n- LGs should prepare budgets in consultation with donors to ensure realistic and attainable revenue estimates. LGs should further ensure compliance with donor requirements to avoid penalties and unnecessary delays.\\n\\n- Adequately sensitize and mobilize communities on tax related matters like compliance and carry out a robust tax payer assessment and enforcement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.6.3 Unutilised funds**\\n\\nFrom the total receipts in the FY of UGX.5,426,900,787,092, only UGX.4,723,235,613,153 (87%) was utilised, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.703,665,173,939 as shown in table below and in **appendix 4 b.**\\n\\n**Table 25: Unutilised funds in Local Governments** **No Activity**  \\n1 Salary, pension and gratuity payment  \\n2 USMID AF in refugee hosting districts  \\n3 Micro scale irrigation  \\n4 DRDIP funding subprojects  \\n5 USMID construction of roads\\n\\n**Amount-Unspent (UGX)** 176,355,014,007 41,830,160,377 28,315,288,149 12,412,158,314 31,425,512,796  \\n6 Others 413,327,040,296 Total  \\n703,665,173,939 Source: LG work plans, budgets and performance reports\\n\\nThe failure to utilise funds led to either partial or non-implementation of the following activities;\\n\\n- 8,347 staff and pensioners/beneficiaries in 115 LGs were under paid.\\n- 4 LGs did not implement 25 infrastructure projects under USMID AF.\\n- In 23 LGs, 190 farmers were not supported with irrigation equipment which exposed a large number of farmers’ plantation to drought.\\n- 46 subprojects under DRDIP in 2 LGs were not implemented.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the failure to absorb the funds as highlighted in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 26: Reasons for under absorption of funds in Local Governments**  \\n**No Activity**  \\n**Explanations from the Accounting Officers**  \\n1  \\nSalary, pension and \\uf0b7 Late disbursement of funds by MoFPED for recruitment of gratuity payment  \\nteachers and health workers.\\n\\n- Delay by MoES to approve the recruitment plans for secondary school teachers.\\n- Delays by MoPS to approve staff structures.  \\n2 USMID AF in \\uf0b7 Delayed dissemination of the approved project designs and refugee hosting  \\nimplementation guidelines by the USMID secretariat in districts  \\nMoLHUD.  \\n3 Micro  \\nscale \\uf0b7 Late disbursement of program funds  \\nirrigation\\n- Failure to co-fund.  \\n4 DRDIP funding \\uf0b7 Late disbursement of program funds and approval of subprojects  \\nsubprojects\\n\\n---\\n\\nfunds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation, these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line with the Public Finance Management Act 2015.\\n\\nI noted that 5 LGs received UGX.3,670,739,179 from external development partners for implementing activities not budgeted for. However, these funds were neither declared to PSST nor a supplementary budget issued contrary to Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015.\\n\\nThis therefore implies that the total budgets of these entities was understated, thus distorting planning and, may result in duplication of activities. Details are shown in the table below.\\n\\n**Table 27: Local Government off- budget financing**  \\n**S Vote Code Entity Name** Amount - UGX** **N**  \\n1 523 Kayunga District  \\n773,412,069  \\n2 544 Nakasongola District  \\n400,000,000  \\n3 586 Otuke District  \\n342,888,374  \\n4 602 Rubirizi District  \\n350,890,654  \\n5 556 Yumbe District  \\n1,803,548,082 Total  \\n3,670,739,179\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such off budget receipts and also receipt of funds not expected at the time of planning.\\n\\nDuring my interaction with PSST indicated that MoFPED created a window to allow off budget financing to be recognised in PBS. In addition, MoFPED is continuously engaging development partners to fund LGs through the government funding system.\\n\\nI advised Government to ensure that all funds are included in the PBS and appropriated by Parliament, and expenditure of such funds follows the government financial system. In addition, all funds received outside the approved budget during the year should be disclosed to the PS/ST for supplementary appropriation.\\n\\n**3.6.5 Excess release of wage funds to LGs**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 28: Excess release of wage funds to Local Governments SN Entity**\\n\\n1.

Details are in **appendix 4 b.**\\n\\nThis action contradicts Section 17(1) and (2) of the PFMA 2015 and will result into misappropriation of public funds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.6.7 Misclassification of expenditure**\\n\\nInstruction 7.10.3 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 stipulates that the chart of accounts provides a basis for a uniform budget classification and execution; therefore, it is mandatory for all votes to use the coding structure to budget and execute the budget.\\n\\nHowever, I made the following observations:\\n\\n- In 43 LGs, UGX.5,461,616,914 relating to pension (212102), pension arrears (321608) and gratuity (213004) was misclassified on code 212102 relating to monthly pension, thus overstating the monthly pension expenditure. Details are in **appendix 4 b.**\\n\\n- In some LGs, UGX. 39,524,117,773 was charged on wrong account item codes contrary to those in which they were budgeted for as shown in the table below.\\n\\n**Table 29: Misclassification of expenditure in Local Governments**  \\n**Program**  \\n**Number of HLGs** Amount (UGX)** Pension and gratuity 43 5,461,616,914 Microscale Irrigation 39 20,478,337,116 Ex-gratia 11 525,038,679 Other expenditure lines 43 13,059,125,064 **Total** 39,524,117,773**\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed that:\\n\\n- All payments of pension, gratuity and pension arrears are aggregated to one code in the interface file.\\n- Different program activities were budgeted for under one account code which led to expenditure being charged wrongly contrary to where they were budgeted for. This is a matter that can only be addressed by PSST MoFPED.\\n\\nI explained to the Accounting Officers that the LGs are likely to deviate from the planned activities without early detection by management.  \\nDuring my interaction with MoFPED it was explained that the PSST will engage MoPS on the aggregation of pension and gratuity matters while misclassifications arising from budgeting on wrong codes, the Accounting Officers will be reminded to appropriately budget for expenditure on the correct codes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSimilarly, Regulation 42 and 43 (2) of the Local Government Financial and Accounting Regulations 2007, require funds to be properly vouched and accounted for within a period of a month.\\n\\nFrom the review of documents supporting payments made in the year, it was noted that payments amounting to UGX.2,495,441,197 in 23 LGs remained un-accounted for by close of the financial year as shown in **Appendix 4 b.**\\n\\nConsequently, I could not confirm that the funds were utilized for the intended purpose and therefore this implies that the expenditure account balances are overstated by the amount not accounted for.\\n\\nI advise the Accounting Officer to provide supporting documentation for this expenditure with a view of initiating a recovery process from the officers who hav failed to account.\\n\\n**3.8 Ex-gratia payments**\\n\\nIn the 2 nd budget call circular for the financial year 2021/2022, the PS/ST requested HLGs to adequately budget for Ex-gratia and Councillor’s allowance in FY 2021/2022.\\n\\nI noted that 31 LGs received UGX.4,543,306,404 (72%) out of the approved budget of UGX.6,290,484,980 resulting into a deficit of UGX.1,747,178,576 as shown in the table below.\\n\\nConsequently, 3,002 Councillors in 36 HLGs were not/under paid by UGX.1,168,823,662 during the financial year under review as shown in **appendix 4 c.**\\n\\nThis has affected the political oversight role in monitoring the implementation of government programs at a local council level thus affecting service delivery.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to the increase in the number of councillors without a corresponding increase in funding as a result of MoFPED capping the IPF for which the entity has no control. The Accounting Officers further stated that the matter had been presented to MOFPED and MOLG for their action.\\n\\nI advised MoFPED to provide sufficient funding to cater for the increased number of political leaders due to the creation of new administrative.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a result, there have been challenges in implementing and monitoring the related service delivery activities. For instance, in the year under review, a sum of UGX.13,628,553,456 was returned to the consolidated fund because of failed implementation.\\n\\nI further noted that there is always either a delay to re-vote the funds or the funds are not re-voted thus affecting the implementation of service delivery activities.\\n\\nI have audited the implementation of these programs and a separate report will be issued and this will form part of the report on the consolidated financial statements of Local Government.\\n\\nCurrently, program monitoring is a responsibility of only OPM and yet they are thin on the ground. My interaction with PS MoLG indicated that there is need to establish a strong project coordination unit to effectively monitor and supervise government programs at local government.\\n\\nI advised the PSST to consider sending the program funds directly to the implementing LGs.\\n\\n**3.10 Implementation of selected service delivery activities**\\n\\nOut of the LG expenditure of UGX.4,723,235,613,153 in the financial year 2021/2022, 49.9% was spent on employee costs which has been reported above as KAM and the balance was utilised in major interventions.

The guidelines/directives on utilisation of the PDM funds were issued towards the end of the financial year after the funds had been released.\\n\\n- My interaction with the LG Accounting Officers revealed that when the guidance was issued, they were in many instances contradicting. For instance, while the PDM secretariat guided that funds should go direct to PDM SACCO accounts in commercial banks, the PSST guided that the funds should be sent to the entity general fund account. While the PDM secretariat required that LGs procure gadgets and tools following the PPDA guidelines, PSST guided that funds for gadgets and tools be repurposed to the parish revolving fund.\\n\\nThe lack of clear guidance and conflicting directives affected program implementation thereby causing a number of challenges as listed below;\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the PSST to ensure that repurposing of appropriated funds is done within the law.\\n\\n**b) Under funding of PDM SACCOs**\\n\\nAnalysis of funds disbursed to SACCOs revealed that 8,703 SACCOs received varying amounts ranging from UGX.2,365,097 to UGX.17,812,103. I also noted that 1,502 SACCOs in 70 LGs did not receive any funding.\\n\\nThe funding variations were due to lack of accurate data on the number of parishes.\\n\\nThis may affect program implementation and attainment of objectives of wealth creation and employment generation at the Parish level.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the failure to fund all SACCOs to shortfalls in releases.  \\nI advised MoFPED to ensure that baseline data is collected by UBOS to inform the subsequent PDM disbursement and other decisions.\\n\\n**c) Payment of PDM SACCOs before registration**\\n\\nG uidance 16 by the PSST in the letter referenced EDP86/103/02 and dated 25 th May 2022 required Accounting Officers to register PDM SACCOs on IFMS after duly registering them under the Cooperative Societies Act (as amended) and signing a Financing Agreement.\\n\\nI noted that in 49 LGs, a total of UGX.29,523,564,220 for revolving funds was transferred to 3,214 SACCOs that were neither registered under the Cooperative Societies Act nor had signed Parish Revolving Fund (PRF) Financing Agreements.\\n\\nThis led to funding of ineligible SACCOs which negatively affected the objective of wealth creation and employment generation.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that this was done to avoid the sweep back of funds to the consolidated account. The Accounting Officers further explained that the process of registering SACCOs was ongoing.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a result, 5 LGs diverted a total of UGX.358,069,571 from the revolving fund to administrative activities without the PSST’s guidance.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to release funds lies with MoFPED for which they had no control.\\n\\nI advised the PSST to ensure that funds are channelled directly to the PDM SACCOs in line with the guidance.\\n\\n**e ) Un-utilised funds on SACCO accounts**\\n\\nI noted that a total of UGX.79,214,076,265 revolving funds paid to 8,703 SACCOs in 169 LGs remained idle on the SACCO bank accounts.\\n\\nFailure to timely utilise disbursed funds delays the achievement of the PDM objectives of improving community livelihoods and will also compromise recovery of the advanced funds.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the non-utilisation of the funds to the halting of PDM activities due to insufficient funds to commence the SACCO operations, delays to register SACCOs and lack of guidance on funds utilisation.\\n\\nI advised the PDM Secretariat and MoFPED to resolve the implementation challenges so that the SACCO operations can commence.\\n\\n**f) Irregularities in recruitment of parish chiefs**\\n\\nThese funds were meant for the recruitment and payment of salaries for the Parish Chiefs whose main role is to mobilize, sensitize and create awareness on PDM programs to the community, as well as coordinate and support implementation of PDM activities among others.\\n\\nI noted irregularities in the recruitment of parish chiefs. For instance, in Butaleja DLG, 15 out of the 39 parish chiefs recruited, had forged academic documents, resulting in loss of government funds worth UGX.12,328,680 which the Accounting Officer had started recovering.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the failure to account to the ongoing program activities and delayed submission of accountabilities by the respective staff.\\n\\nI advised MoLG to ensure that Accounting Officers adequately account for all the PDM funds utilised.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn a bid to address the challenges in the implementation of the PDM, Government through MoFPED should harmonise the issuance of guidelines and ensure all guidelines are issued through the PDM secretariat. Considering that the SACCOs have been funded, the PDM Secretariat should guide on funds utilisation to enable implementation of enterprise activities leading to wealth creation and employment.\\n\\n**3.12 Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP)**\\n\\nUganda is Africa’s largest refugee hosting country with over 1.5 million refugees and asylum-seekers. This has occasioned social, economic and environmental needs to the host communities and the displaced (refugees and returnees).\\n\\nIn response to these needs, the GoU, through the Office of the Prime Minister, implemented the Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP), aimed at improving access to basic social services, expanding economic opportunities and enhancing environmental management in the 15 districts.\\n\\nDespite the achievements of the programme, such as increased earnings of vulnerable communities, improved infrastructures and provision of alternative energy sources among others, the overall implementation of the project has been slow with notable challenges.\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22, 15 LGs received UGX.211,983,309,284 from Central Government to implement various activities under DRDIP. Below are my summary findings, details of which are included in the individual reports that have been issued separately;\\n\\n**3.12.1 Funding and Absorption**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 31: Funding and absorption of 7.2 Development Displacement Impacts Project**\\n\\n**Response to**\\n\\n**SN Purpose Budgeted Released Utilised Unutilised** **amount - UGX**  \\n**amount by** OPM - UGX**\\n\\n**amount by the funds - UGX** **DLGs - UGX**  \\n1 Social and Economic 195,564,238,35 154,667,673,38 142,866,878,89 11,800,794,498 Services Infrastructure 3 9 1  \\n2 Sustainable Environmental 40,033,537,720 19,558,580,728 18,689,049,164 869,531,564 Management  \\n3 Livelihoods Program 39,530,477,364 30,230,194,334 29,784,194,334 446,000,000\\n\\n4 DRDIP Operations 10,012,115,709 7,526,860,833 7,216,183,732 310,677,101\\n\\n**Total**\\n\\n**285,140,369,146 211,983,309,284 198,556,306,12 13,427,003,163 1**\\n\\nOut of the total receipts of UGX.211,983,309,284, only UGX.198,556,306,121 (94%) was spent, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.13,427,003,163 (6%).\\n\\nAs a result of the failure to utilise all funds released, 46 subprojects in the 2 LGs were not funded, which affects the attainment of the program objective of providing support to the poor and vulnerable people in the refugee hosting areas.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to release funds lies with the DRDIP secretariat at OPM.\\n\\nI advised the PSST to release funds in accordance with the appropriation. **3.12.2 Delayed Implementation of subprojects for the FY 2021/22**\\n\\nI reviewed the DRDIP approved work plans, performance reports and undertook audit inspections to ascertain the status of implementation of the subprojects and compliance with the project guidelines. I made the following observations and the details are in **appendix 6 b to d;**\\n\\n**a) Infrastructure subprojects**\\n\\nUGX.142,866,878,891 was released by OPM and subsequently disbursed by the respective districts to 192 subprojects for construction, rehabilitation or expansion of basic social services such as education, human health facilities; and economic infrastructure such as roads and market structures. A review of the progress reports and interviews with the DRDIP liaison officer revealed the following;\\n\\n- 182 subprojects that received UGX.135,411,714,542 in 15 districts had not commenced construction activities for which they were funded by the end of the financial year.\\n\\n- Only 4 subprojects that received UGX.1,400,664,349 in Arua and Koboko DLGs were ongoing as at the close of the financial year.\\n\\n- 6 subprojects that received UGX.6,054,500,000 in Kamwenge and Koboko DLGs had fully implemented the planned activities as at the close of the financial year.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**b) Livelihoods Program**\\n\\nUGX.29,784,194,334 was released by OPM and subsequently disbursed by 13 districts to 668 subproject groups for small businesses, skills-based jobs, and service enterprises. A review of the progress reports and interviews with the DRDIP liaison officers revealed the following;\\n\\n- 307 subprojects groups that received UGX.12,847,363,682 in 8 districts had not commenced as at the close of the financial year.\\n\\n- 149 subprojects groups that received UGX.8,223,780,652 in 5 districts were ongoing as at the close of the financial year.\\n\\n- 212 subprojects groups that received UGX.8,713,050,000 in Kamwenge, Isingiro and Obongi districts were fully implemented as at the close of the financial year.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the delayed implementation of infrastructure subprojects to late release of funds, with most of the funds being received in the last quarter of the financial year.\\n\\n**c) Sustainable environmental management**\\n\\nBy the close of the financial year, all the Sustainable Environmental Management activities had not commenced in all the 309 subprojects in 15 DLGs, yet a sum of UGX.19,703,894,013 was released by OPM.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed it to suspension of activities owing to an investigation by the Inspectorate of Government.\\n\\nDue to the delayed commencement of the subprojects and suspension of sustainable environment management subprojects, UGX.161,993,299,642 was lying idle on the subprojects’/ subgroups’ bank accounts as at 30 th June 2022. Therefore, the program objective of providing services and support to the vulnerable communities may not be achieved.\\n\\nI advise MoFPED to timely release funds to enable timely implementation of planned activities leading to attainment of program objectives.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis hinders the implementation of corrective action against negative environmental and social effects of the subprojects.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the lack of the environmental and social management plans to the failure by Ministry of Works and Transport to conduct environmental assessment as per the DRDIP guidelines.\\n\\nI advised Ministry of Works and Transport to expedite the environmental assessment process and produce the environmental and social management plans to inform the environmental mitigation activities.\\n\\n**3.12.4 Inspections of service delivery activities FYs 2019/20 and 2020/21**\\n\\nThe FY2021/22 (year under review) activities were largely not implemented. I therefore undertook inspection of subprojects and subgroups funded in the FYs 2019/20 and 2020/21 and observed the following details of which are in **appendix f.**\\n\\n- 85 infrastructure and sustainable environment subprojects were completed and were operational while 39 livelihood subgroups were ongoing at the time of audit.\\n\\n- Of the 85 infrastructure and sustainable environment subprojects, 32 infrastructure subprojects worth UGX.11,447,182,034 had not been put to use by the communities, by the time of inspection. These subprojects included; Morta bridge in Yumbe had no access road, Out-Patients Departments, maternity wards, among others.\\n\\n- 179 sustainable environment subprojects worth UGX.9,949,108,151 had stalled.\\n\\n- 70 sustainable environmental management subprojects worth UGX.3,353,875,333 had not commenced due to ongoing investigations by the Inspectorate of Government.\\n\\nIdle projects undermine the objective of the projects and deprive the community of the intended services/benefits.\\n\\nFailure to put in use completed infrastructure subprojects, delays in implementation of subprojects and subgroups, and failure to complete the infrastructure subprojects was attributed to none appointment of contract managers. Indeed, I noted that 3 LGs did not appoint contract managers to aid in the implementation of the UGX.21,860,851,866 sub projects.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the OPM and Accounting Officers to ensure that adequate monitoring and supervision of the subprojects and subgroups. The Accounting Officers were further advised to expedite the implementation of all stalled activities.\\n\\n**3.12.5 Idle funds on completed subproject accounts**\\n\\nI reviewed the implementation of infrastructure subprojects funded in the FYs 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21, and noted UGX.2,751,804,956 in 66 subprojects in 3 districts remained unutilised after completion of the planned subproject activities. These funds are lying idle in commercial bank accounts of the respective subprojects.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that this due to lack of specific guidance from OPM on how to manage the unutilised funds on subproject accounts.\\n\\nI advised OPM to recover the unutilised funds and going forward, issue guidelines on the utilisation of the unspent funds.\\n\\n**3.12.6 Funding of non-existent subprojects**\\n\\nThree unapproved subprojects were supported with a total of UGX.2,777,500,000 in Lamwo DLG contrary to Section 5.6 of the DRDIP Operation Manual, 2019 requiring approval of all subproject plans/proposals by OPM.\\n\\nI further inspected the purported subprojects and noted that they were non-existent, as detailed in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 32: Funding of non-existent subprojects**  \\n**SN Name of the subproject** Amount (UGX) Audit remark**\\n\\n1.

The Accounting Officer further explained that the funding of the construction of community centre and fencing at Palabek Gem Zone one Block 1 is under investigation by IGG.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the recovery of funds and consult the Accountant General on where the funds should be remitted.\\n\\n**3.12.7 Procurement irregularities**\\n\\nI noted a number of procurement irregularities in the implementation of DRDIP program which are illustrated below;\\n\\n- 99 procurements in the districts of Arua, Terego and Obongi worth UGX.4,646,434,329 were not cleared by the subproject Community Project Management Committees and Community Procurement Committees. These procurements were not undertaken by the communities but rather by OPM and therefore the selected contractors were rejected.\\n\\n- 1 procurement worth UGX.250,000,000 in Yumbe DLG was awarded to a contractor who lacked capacity as required by the procurement selection criteria. Subsequently, the contractor abandoned the works.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the procurement of the service providers were undertaken by OPM without the involvement of the communities.\\n\\nI advised OPM to harmonise the DRDIP guidelines with the procurement laws to guide the process of procuring contractors.\\n\\n**3.13 Implementation of Micro Scale Irrigation Programme**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda is implementing the micro scale irrigation programme in 47 LGs with the aim of supporting smallholder farmers transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture through the provision of irrigation equipment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.13.1 Budget allocation of programme expenditure by category**\\n\\nParagraph 3.1 of the grant, budget and implementation guidelines-Micro Scale Irrigation states that the Micro Scale Irrigation Grant will fund two types of expenditure categories: (i) capital development (micro scale irrigation equipment) (75%) and (ii) complementary services (25%).\\n\\nI noted, 8 LGs allocated 71% for capital development and 29% for complementary services contrary to the guidelines that require the allocation to be 75% and 25% respectively as shown in the table below and **appendix 7 a.**\\n\\n**Table 33: Budget allocation of programme expenditure by category**  \\n**Item** Revised % Allocation Variance** **budget - UGX of the total** (%)** **budget**  \\nCapital Development (micro scale 4,840,551,221 71%  \\n(4%) irrigation equipment) (75%)\\n\\nComplementary services (25%) 1,963,248,498 29% 4% **Total 6,803,799,719 100% 0%**\\n\\nFailure to budget according to the set thresholds led to diversion of funds to non- priority activities thus hindering achievement of intended program objectives.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the mandate of determine IPFs and release of funds lies with MoFPED for which we have no control.\\n\\nI advised MoFPED to allocate funds in accordance with the guidelines. **3.13.2 Slow program implementation**\\n\\nI noted that 40 LGs budgeted to receive UGX.50,081,789,451 for micro scale irrigation program, out of which UGX.49,038,618,192 (98%) was warranted resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1,043,171,259 (2%). Out of the total receipts of UGX.49,038,618,192, UGX.20,723,330,043 (42%) was spent resulting into unutilised funds of UGX.28,315,288,149.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI reviewed the status of implementation of the Micro-Scale Irrigation-Development under Production and Marketing and noted slow progress as indicated below and in **appendix 7 b and 7 c;**\\n\\n- 10 LGs did not utilise any of the funds warranted for procurement of irrigation equipment of UGX.9,778,756,031. These included; Luuka, Sironko, Kyotera, Tororo, Bududa, Kamuli, Mubende, Manafwa, Kapchorwa and Ntungamo DLGs.\\n\\n- 23 LGs planned and sensitised 31,487 farmers to educate them on the benefits of irrigation and the importance of co-funding. I also noted that 16 LGs did not plan to sensitise farmers despite allocating funds for procurement irrigation equipment.\\n\\n- Out of the total of farmers who were sensitised, only 8,781 farmers expressed interest to uptake the irrigation equipment, out of which, only 642 co-funded UGX.2,212,604,768 to receive equipment worth UGX.9,393,753,304.\\n\\n- 479 farmers who co-funded received irrigation equipment. 190 farmers did not receive irrigation equipment despite paying the co-funding worth UGX.168,172,295.\\n\\n- 27 farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.680,694,598 without paying co-funding while some farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.329,281,703 with partial co-funding. This was contrary to the program guideline and therefore irregular.\\n\\nThe slow implementation exposes the farmers to adverse effects caused by the changes in weather thus affecting the crop yields.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the under absorption to program design challenges which include: inefficient training and sensitisation mechanism, high co-funding rates and high cost of the irrigation equipment compared to the market prices.\\n\\nI advised MAAIF to consider redesigning the program with the view of making the co- funding affordable for small scale farmers.\\n\\n- The concrete stands to hold the tanks were incomplete and therefore the water tanks that support the irrigation equipment could not be installed.\\n\\n- The water sources were shallow and therefore the water pump could not pump adequate water need for the gardens.\\n\\n- The water tank stands were not of the required height to enable adequate flow of water.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- The contractor had delivered under capacity tanks than required 10,000 litre water tanks and therefore underutilising the irrigation equipment.\\n\\n- The drag hose pipes were not yet been fitted to enable the flow of water to the garden hence making the equipment idle.\\n\\nThe challenges in the functionality of the irrigation equipment were attributed to the failure by LGs to carry out monitoring and supervision of the installation of the equipment supplied to farmers. This was due to inadequate resources to the District Production Departments that undertake the supervision of the irrigation activities.\\n\\nI advised Government through MAAIF to ensure that Accounting Officers have adequate resources to undertake supervision activities.\\n\\n**3.14** Support to organised groups for improvement of people’s livelihood**\\n\\nSupport to Micro Projects is a Government of Uganda programme which is part of the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan 2 (PRDP 2) in Bunyoro, Teso and Luwero- Rwenzori regions. The program aims at enhancing Household Incomes through mobilizing communities for social economic development and peace building to spur economic recovery of the supported communities.\\n\\nHowever, previous OAG audits have highlighted challenges in the management and implementation of the grant. These challenges include: lack of accountability, Inadequate monitoring, and exclusion of district technical teams in the appraisal and approval of supported groups among others.\\n\\nIt is against this background that I audited the implementation of Micro Projects to establish whether the funds released to the groups were utilized in accordance with the guidelines.\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22, 24 LGs received UGX.2,471,262,293 from Central Government to fund Micro Projects.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis was attributed to failure by OPM to provide appropriate IPFs based on the number micro projects planned for by the LGs.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the Indicative Planning Figures are issued by MoFPED for which they had no control while under absorption was attributed to delay in release of funds by MoFPED.\\n\\nI advised the MoFPED to timely fund budgets as appropriated by Parliament. **B. Delayed disbursement of funds**\\n\\nGuideline 11.2 (e and f) of the Grants to support Household Income Enhancement Projects under Special Programmes, 2020 requires the district to disburse/transfer funds to the respective beneficiary groups/institution and ensure proper and timely accountability of Programme funds released to the beneficiary groups.\\n\\nI noted that OPM delayed to disburse funds to the 20 LGs. As a result, the LGs also delayed to disburse UGX.836,470,000 to the 168 groups with delays of up to 9 months. Details are in **appendix 8 a.**\\n\\nAs a result of the delayed disbursement, the activity implementation at the group level had not started thus the program objective of enhancing household incomes was not achieved.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to the delays in execution of the appraisal and verification processes of target groups.\\n\\nI advise OPM to always provide Indicative planning figures in advance to enable the entities adequately plan for the program.\\n\\n**C. Unaccounted for funds**\\n\\nI noted that in 7 LGs failed to account for UGX.248,510,000 meant to support the implementation of micro projects in community based groups. Details are in **appendix 8 a.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 35: status of beneficiary databases**  \\n**SN Category** Number of LGs Electronic Manual 1** Maintained a data base 19 2 17 **2** Did not maintain 5 0 0 Total 24 2 17\\n\\nI could not rule out the possibility of multiple government funding to groups.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Accountant General had recently introduced a policy of e-registration for all groups which would resolve the current challenge.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to expedite the introduction and rollout of the e- registration for all groups.\\n\\n**E.** Funding of groups above the maximum threshold**\\n\\nGuideline 5.6 for Grants to support Household Income Enhancement Projects under Special Programmes issued on September 2020 requires funding to groups of people and progressive individuals to be between 1,000,000/= and 10,000,000/= depending on the nature of the project and group numbers. In some special cases with the express authority of the Political Leadership, the grant may be increased after evaluation of the need.\\n\\nI noted that 33 groups in 5 LGs were supported beyond the maximum funding threshold resulting into an excess payment of UGX.221,000,000 without authorization from political leadership as required by the grant guidelines. Details are in **appendix 8 b.**\\n\\nThis limited the number of groups that should have benefited from the grant and contravenes the limits set in the guideline.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that these groups received funding directly form OPM for which they had no control.\\n\\nI advised OPM to consider funding groups through the district administration and in accordance with the set thresholds.\\n\\n- I observed that 2 micro projects in Nakasongola DLG funded with UGX.25,000,000 were non-existent groups.\\n- I also noted that 18 groups in 10 LGs implemented un-approved activities worth UGX.104,320,000.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis resulted in a diversion of funds and hindered the Government’s objective of enhancing Household Incomes.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the funds that were released to the groups were less than the initial IPFs as determined by OPM. This resulted into diversion of funds to undertake affordable enterprise activities on the premise that the funds available were insufficient.\\n\\nI advised OPM to provide sufficient funding for approved group activities. **3.15 Operationalization of new cities**\\n\\nOn 28 th April, 2020, Parliament approved the creation of 15 new cities in Uganda, in line with Article 179 (1) (A) of the Constitution out of which 10 cities were operationalized.\\n\\nThe creation of these Cities brought on board 42 sub-counties, five (5) Town Council and merged 28 Municipality Divisions into 20 new City Divisions to form the ten (10) new Cities.\\n\\nThe creation was meant to attract good quality leaders, facilitate improved delivery of services and meet the expectations of the Citizens.\\n\\nDuring the audit of Financial Year 2020/21, a number of challenges were identified including; funding the operations of the new cities, restructuring of the staff establishment following annexation of lower local governments, lack of guidance from the Minister of Local Government on equitable sharing of assets among affected LGs, and transfer of liabilities.  \\nDuring the Financial Year 2021/22, I noted that the challenges have persisted despite my earlier recommendations. In addition, I noted that there are challenges in financial reporting.\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22, 10 Cities received UGX.427,337,108,536 from Central Government to fund the operations of Cities. Below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately and in **appendix 9** of this report;\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.15.2 Revenue sharing**\\n\\nSection 85(1) of the Local Governments Act, CAP 243, (as amended) requires that the City and Municipal Council’s revenue shall be collected by the Division Councils, and a Division Council shall retain 50 percent of all the revenue it collects in its area of jurisdiction and remit 50 percent to the City or Municipal Council.\\n\\nParagraph 78 of the Budget Execution Circular (BEC) for the FY 2021/2022, issued by the PS/ST reminded the Cities to utilize 50 percent of the total revenues collected at the centre and the remaining 50 percent to be utilized at the Divisions.\\n\\nOut of the budgeted local revenue collections of UGX.37,963,421,372, 8 Cities collected UGX.20,061,189,792 out of which UGX.10,030,594,896 was supposed to be remitted to the Divisions. It was however observed that only UGX.9,621,037,504 (96%) was remitted leading to under remittance of UGX.409,557,393 (4%). Under remittance of shared revenue affected implementation of planned activities at the division level.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to funding challenges which forced the cities to utilise the funds at the Headquarters.\\n\\nI advised MoLG and MoFPED to ensure that the Accounting Officers always comply with the requirement of the Local Governments Act and Guidance of the PS/ST with regards to revenue sharing.\\n\\n**3.15.3 Delayed implementation of the approved City structure**\\n\\nAccording to the Guidelines for the implementation of the City structures, the Cabinet under minute 21 (CT 2022) approved the recommended mandate, strategic objectives, functions, staff structures and proposed wage requirements for the new Cities.\\n\\nGuideline 5.6 of these implementation guidelines require City Councils to adopt the customised structure, implement the structure in accordance with the implementation guideline and secure funding for new structure in accordance with Local Government Financial and Accounting Regulations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.15.4 Transfer of assets and liabilities**\\n\\nSection 188 of the Local Governments Act CAP 243, (as amended) provides that at the creation of a new Local Government unit, the Minister shall ensure the equitable sharing of property between the original and new Local Governments.\\n\\nIn a letter dated October 21 st 2021, the Attorney General guided all Districts to establish their headquarters outside the Cities’ jurisdiction. The immovable assets will naturally pass on to the Cities while movable assets should equitably be shared between the LGs and the New Cities as the Minister shall advise in accordance with Section 188 of the Local Government Act.\\n\\nFrom my review of the financial statements, asset registers, board of survey reports and interview with management, I made the following observations;\\n\\n**a) Lack of guidance on property sharing**\\n\\nI noted that the Minister had not issued guidance on the equitable sharing of movable assets contrary to Section 188 of the Local Governments Act. Consequently, the assets of LGs had neither been transferred nor disclosed in the financial statements of the Cities.\\n\\nTherefore, the financial statements of the Cities do not reflect the correct financial position at the year end and the assets could be misappropriated during this transitional period.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that this was a challenge for them in the absence of guidelines from the Minister responsible for Local Government.\\n\\nMy interaction with MoLG revealed that there challenges in developing guidelines and regulations because the earlier guidance and regulations issued by the Minister of Local government where challenged in courts of law and Parliament. MoLG indicated that they were in the process of amending the Local Government Act.\\n\\nI advised Government through MoLG to expedite the issuance of property sharing guidelines to streamline the management and use of these properties.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**c) Non-disclosure of liabilities**\\n\\nI noted that there were liabilities in 5 Cities amounting to UGX.1,763,698,264 resulting from the merger of 75 LLGs. These liabilities were not disclosed in the entities’ financial statements as shown in the table below.\\n\\n**Table 36: Non-disclosure of liabilities**  \\n**SN City** Amount (UGX)**\\n\\n1. Jinja 1,320,853,586\\n2. Mbarara 187,992,208\\n3. Mbale 75,946,748\\n4. Soroti 12,300,210\\n5. Fort portal  \\n166,605,512 Total  \\n1,763,698,264\\n\\nI further noted that Hoima, Lira, Masaka and Arua cities had not reconciled the position of liabilities as at the close of the financial year due to insufficient information.\\n\\nDelayed settlement of these obligations will lead to litigation thus a loss to Government through court fines.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the liabilities for the Municipal Council were taken over by the Cities and are being settled as and when the funds are made available.\\n\\nDuring my interaction with the Accountant General indicated that the Office of the Accountant General is yet to provide guidance on the presentation and disclosure of liabilities.\\n\\nI advised Government through the MoFPED to ensure that Accounting Officer disclose these arrears in the financial statements and budget for them accordingly.\\n\\n**3.15.5 Implementation Challenges**\\n\\nI noted a number of challenges regarding operationalization of the Cities. These have been summarised in below;\\n\\n- Failure to fund operations. The cities did not receive any additional grants except for increase in wage to cater for salaries of annexed staff.\\n- Limited Office space and inadequate Office Equipment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn the bid to streamline the operationalisation of new cities, there is need for Ministry of Local Government to fast track the amendment of the Local Governments Act.\\n\\n**3.16 Implementation of Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers (UGIFT)**\\n\\nDuring the Financial years 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 Government released UGX.81,640,150,547 and contracted firms to construction Seed school and Health centres in 43 HLGs.\\n\\nOver the years the UGIFT program has faced implementation challenges and therefore that projects have either stalled, remained incomplete or have been abandoned raising stake holders’ concerns.\\n\\nConsequently, during the financial year 2021/2022, I sampled 41 projects in Education and 58 Health in 43 HLGs to assess the extent of project implementation. I made the following observation;\\n\\n**3.16.1 Failure to absorb project funds**\\n\\nI noted that a sample of 39 projects in Education and 51 projects failed to absorb funds availed to them form implementation of activities and as a result a total of UGX.48,596,056,121 remained on projects accounts.\\n\\nI noted that in 43 HLGs, out of the total receipts of UGX.81,640,150,547, UGX.33,044,094,426 was spent representing absorption level of 40%. I further noted there were delays in procurement processes in 40 HLGs which delayed the commencement of works. Details are in **appendix 10 a.**\\n\\nUnder absorption of funds limits the implementation of planned activities thus affecting service delivery.  \\nThe Accounting Officer explained that there was delayed procurement of the contractors as well as delayed release of funds.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to address the bottle necks that impede on the implementation of activities to avoid funds being swept back.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed delayed completion of works to weaknesses in contract supervision, limited capacity of contractors in terms of equipment, finance and human resources as well as the effects of Covid-19 restrictions that curtailed mobilisation of equipment, materials and manpower.  \\nI informed the Accounting Officer that the matter will be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.\\n\\n**3.16.3 Payments to UPDF Engineers Brigade for Construction Works**\\n\\nThe MoH and MoLG signed a MoU on 5 th November, 2021 with the Ministry of Defence & Veterans Affairs (MoDVA) to undertake construction of Health facilities using the UPDF Engineers Brigade.\\n\\nTo operationalise the arrangement, the LGs were also required to sign implementation agreements/MoUs with the Engineers Brigade, in which;\\n\\n- The LGs were to advance 30% funds for the total project cost to the Engineers Brigade.\\n- Payments to the Engineers Brigade should be supported by certification of previous works by the LG and requisitions for subsequent works done as agreed in the drawings, price schedule and BoQs.\\n- The Engineers Brigade submits a Project Implementation Schedule to Project Management Teams of the LGs prior to commencement of works, to enable progress monitoring.\\n\\nDuring my audit, I noted the following; **a) Funds advanced**\\n\\n88 projects in the LGs worth UGX.14,901,441,747 were awarded to the Engineers Brigade, of which UGX.12,168,409,694 (82%) had been advanced by year end, contrary to the requirement of advancing 30% of the contract sum. The Accounting Officers attributed it to the guidance by the PS MoH to release all funds meant for the construction of UgIFT projects to avoid funds being returned to the consolidated fund.\\n\\nBy the time of writing this report (December 2022) only UGX.6,819,552,726 (56%) had been released by the Brigade for project implementation with a balance of UGX.5,348,856,968 remaining unutilised.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMy inspection of 81 (92%) projects worth UGX14,744,224,567 revealed that works were still ongoing, while 7 projects in Namutumba DLG worth UGX.157,217,180 had not commenced because land had not been handed over to the Engineers Brigade.\\n\\nAccounting Officers attributed the delayed commencement of construction works to lack of capacity by the Engineers Brigade to implement all LG projects.\\n\\nI advise Government to ensure that in future timely instructions are communicated to LGs to enable implementation of Government projects. Meanwhile the stalled projects should be started and expedited.\\n\\n**3.16.4 Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program (USMID-AF) – Refugee Hosting Districts**\\n\\nThe Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program (USMID-AF) is a 5 year program being implemented by the Government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MoLHUD), with the aim of enhancing service delivery through improved local infrastructure in 11 Local Governments (LGs) hosting refugees effective Financial Year 2018/2019.\\n\\nWith the Financial Year 2021/22 being its fourth year of implementation, there has been a notable delay in the commencement of the infrastructure projects in the beneficiary Districts.\\n\\nDuring the FY2021/22, MoLHUD transferred UGX.50,119,497,453 to the 11 implementing LGs. I audited the implementation of the program to establish the status of implementation and below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;\\n\\n**A. Funding and Absorption**\\n\\nI reviewed the approved USMID-AF budget allocation for the Financial Year 2021/2022 and noted that 11 entities had approved total budgets of UGX.54,254,412,669, out of which, only UGX.50,119,497,453 (92%) was received, leading to a shortfall of UGX.4,134,915,216 (8%) as shown in the **table below and Appendix 11 a.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn addition, out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.50,119,497,453, only UGX.8,195,395,478 (16%) was utilised by the 11 HLGs resulting in an unutilised balance of UGX.41,924,101,975 (84%). Consequently, 31 funded projects were not implemented while 22 funded projects were partially implemented.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the shortfalls to the fact that the funds are released at the discretion of the USMID-AF secretariat at MoLHUD. The Accounting Officers also attributed the under absorption of funds to the delayed procurement processes owing to the delayed dissemination of approved project designs by the USMID-AF Secretariat at the MoLHUD.\\n\\nI advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that returned funds are revoted for the implementation of planned activities by the Accounting Officers.\\n\\n**B.** Delayed Implementation of Infrastructure Investments**\\n\\nI reviewed the USMID-AF approved work plans, performance reports and carried out physical inspections to ascertain the status of implementation of the funded projects and made the following observations;\\n\\n- During F/Y 2020/2021, 8 Districts did not implement 46 infrastructure projects funded at a total of UGX.60,611,012,948 **Appendix 11 b refers.**\\n\\n- During F/Y 2021/22, 7 Districts partially implemented 22 infrastructure projects funded at a total of UGX.26,126,296,470. **Appendix 11 b refers.** Further, 4 Districts did not implement 25 infrastructure projects despite receiving funding totalling UGX.21,387,083,470. **Appendix 11 b refers.**\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to the delay by the USMID-AF Secretariat/ MoLHUD to avail the districts with approved infrastructure project designs and implementation guidelines.\\n\\nThe unspent balances were returned to the Consolidated Fund and thus the program objective of ensuring enhanced service delivery through improved local infrastructure was not achieved.  \\nI advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that infrastructure project designs and implementation guidelines are issued to Accounting Officers timely to ensure the implementation of planned activities. I further advised the MoLHUD to ensure that returned funds are revoted for the implementation of planned activities by the Accounting Officers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFailure to directly link planned activities to the program may lead to diversion of funds to unplanned activities thus affecting the achievement of the intended program objectives.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed the anomaly to the guidance received from the Ministry to plan for the USMID-AF activities under Central Government Transfers.\\n\\nI advised the MoFPED and MoLHUD to instruct Accounting Officers to ensure that USMID-AF funded activities are directly linked to the program and thus identifiable in the district budget.\\n\\n**D. Failure to maintain separate bank accounts for USMID-AF program funds**\\n\\nArticle 4 (e) of the Program Participating Agreement requires the Accounting Officer to ensure that a separate Program Bank Account is opened through which program funds are managed. Article 4 (p) of the Program Participating Agreement requires the Accounting Officer to ensure that proceeds of the grant and any interest earned are used exclusively to fund eligible program activities.\\n\\nI noted that the beneficiary LGs did not maintain separate bank accounts for the USMID-AF program funds, contrary to Article 4 (e) of the Program Participating Agreement.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the funds were managed through the districts’ TSA accounts held in Bank of Uganda in accordance with Section 24.6 of the Treasury Instructions.  \\nFailure to maintain a separate bank account for USMID-AF resulted in failure to earn interest revenue from unutilised program funds. Failure to maintain a separate bank account may also result in comingling of funds hence exposing them to diversion.\\n\\nI advised the Government through MoFPED and MoLHUD to harmonise the requirement for opening a separate bank account and where necessary, ensure that the Accounting Officers open and maintain separate bank accounts for USMID-AF funds in accordance with the program agreement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.17.1 Funding and absorption of funds**\\n\\nI reviewed the approved USMID allocation for the Financial Year 2021/2022 and noted that 11 Municipal Councils received UGX.156,321,511,324 as budgeted representing 100% revenue performance.\\n\\nOut of the total receipts of UGX.156,321,511,324, only UGX.124,895,998,528 (80%) was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.31,425,512,796 (20%) as shown in the table below.\\n\\n**Table 38: Funding and absorption of USMID**  \\n**Year 2021/22** Description Approved Budget Release (B) (UGX) Expenditure Unspent %** **(A) (UGX)** (C) (UGX) (B-C) (UGX) absorption** Developm 156,321,511,324 156,321,511,324 124,895,998,528 31,425,512,796 80 ent grant\\n\\nUnder absorption of released funds resulted in non-implementation of planned activities. For example, 8 infrastructure projects worth UGX.12,832,857,565 in Hoima City were not completed.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers attributed this to delayed procurement of contractors by Ministry of lands, Housing and Urban Development as well as delays in design review by the contractor.\\n\\nI advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that in future, contractual designs are planned early to avoid delays. In the meantime, the Ministry should ensure that Accounting Officers rollover the unimplemented activities to the subsequent period.\\n\\n**3.17.2 Unreleased previous year committed funds**\\n\\nSection 17(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 stipulates that every appropriation by Parliament shall expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made. Furthermore, Section 17 (2) of the same Act stipulates that \"A vote that does not expend money that was appropriated to the vote for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year repay the money to the Consolidated Fund.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 39: unreleased previous year committed funds**  \\n**SN Entity** Unspent balance FY.

In this kind of arrangement, the District’s interests tend to be suppressed by the other stakeholders.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD with a view of redefining the relationship in the mining industry and having a MoU clearly spelling out the rights and obligations of each party.\\n\\n**3.18.3 Failure by mining companies to submit monthly returns to MEMD**\\n\\nRegulation 53 of the Mining Regulation 2004 “Monthly returns to be furnished” provides that Every holder of an exploration or retention licence shall, as soon as circumstances permit and in any case not later than fourteen days after the end of each quarter, lodge in triplicate at the nearest office of the Commissioner, statements in English in Form XXVI in the First Schedule to these Regulations; and in the case of the holder of a prospecting or location licence or a mining lease such statements shall be provided to the Commissioner in Forms XXV and XXVII in the First Schedule to these Regulations not later than fourteen days after the month reported on.\\n\\nHowever, I reviewed the declarations made by the mining companies on the cadastre interface at the MEMD and noted that, a number of these companies failed to submit/lodge monthly returns to the MEMD.\\n\\nThis encourages under or non-declaration of revenue by the mining companies, which affects the royalties thereof.\\n\\nThe above is attributed to deliberate non-compliance by the companies to the regulation and failure by MEMD to enforce compliance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis encourages under-declaration of the volume and value of minerals mined by the mining parties.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD to consider emphasising verification of mineral returns to ensure that the Central government, District and land owners receive rightful revenue share from royalties declared and paid by the mining parties.\\n\\n**3.18.5 Non-participation of the CAO in licencing and lease approval process**\\n\\nRegulations 11, 19, 23 and 38 of the Mining Regulations 2004 provide guidance in the application for exploration, retention, location licences and mining lease, stating that applications for such mineral rights shall be logged with the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the district concerned within thirty days of erection of a location beacon for forwarding to the Commissioner. In addition, Regulation 8 stipulates the procedure on receipt of application for mineral right by the Chief Administrative Officer.\\n\\nHowever, I noted that the CAO does not participate in the receiving and forwarding of the applications for mineral rights to the Commissioner, MEMD.\\n\\nThis has contributed to disconnect in collaboration between the mining parties (companies, associations and individuals) and the District, thus affecting the sharing of information between the parties.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD and establish a mechanism of active participation in the licencing and lease approval processes.\\n\\n**3.19 Luwero-Rwenzori Development Program (LRDP)**\\n\\nLRDP is Discretionary Development Equalization Grant (DDEG) that seeks to enable communities enhance their household incomes. The program was rolled out in 39 LGs in the Luwero-Rwenzori Triangle and is one of the fiscal reforms implemented by Government to improve service delivery. LRDP accounts for 5% of the entire DDEG funds allocated to these Districts in the financial year 2021/2022.\\n\\nHowever, previous OAG audits have highlighted challenges in the management and implementation of the LRDP grant. These challenges include: application of LRDP funds to ineligible expenditures and activities, under remittances of funds, late release of funds, under absorption of LRDP funds, diversion of funds.\\n\\n---\\n\\nfindings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;\\n\\n**3.19.1 Allocation of funds among program activities**\\n\\nParagraph 1.4 Table 5 (as hereunder) of the DDEG guidelines 2021/2022 provides the maximum thresholds for which a District can use to implement a wide range of infrastructure within their mandate and according to their local priorities and needs.\\n\\n**Table 40: allocation of funds among program activities**  \\n**Main Expenditure Items** Threshold** Infrastructure Projects, including Physical Planning and land titling  \\nMinimum 80% Investment Servicing and Monitoring  \\nMaximum 10% Performance Improvement  \\nMaximum 10%\\n\\nI observed that 7 LGs did not allocate funds in accordance with the required thresholds. For instance, in 7 LGs, infrastructure projects funds were allocated below minimum requirement of 80% whereas the investment servicing and performance improvement were allocated above the maximum of 10% as indicated in the table below and in **appendix 13 a.**\\n\\n**Table 41: Allocation of investment thresholds**  \\n**No. Main Expenditure items** Threshold Allocation Amount -** **UGX** 1** Infrastructure Projects, including Minimum 80% 70% 1,871,695,608 Physical Planning and land titling  \\n**2** Performance Improvement Maximum 10% 13% 299,789,983 **3** Investment Servicing and Maximum 10% 17% 483,628,600 Monitoring  \\nTOTAL  \\n2,655,114,191\\n\\nThe diversion of funds hindered the achievement of intended outcomes of the grant of equalizing development of LGs and therefore affecting equitable distribution of resources and delivery of services.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the allocation of Indicative Planning Figures (IPFs) is a mandate of MoFPED for which the LGs do not have control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 42: Funding and absorption** SN Cost centre Approved Amount % Expenditur Amount not % Budget - UGX Released - UGX fundin e - UGX absorbed - Absorpti g UGX on 1** Infrastructure 8,164,927,374 8,153,926,373 100% 7,682,602,7 471,323,669 94% Projects, including 04  \\nPhysical Planning  \\nand land titling  \\n**2** Performance 843,710,153 843,710,153 100% 853,914,340 -10,204,187 101% Improvement  \\n**3** Investment 1,111,423,280 1,075,179,930 97% 1,063,687,3 11,492,592 99% Servicing and 38  \\nMonitoring  \\n**4** Transfer of LRDP 15,506,893,697 15,504,103,696 100% 15,514,093, -9,990,000 100% funds to LLGs  \\n696  \\nTOTAL 25,626,954,504 25,576,920,152 100% 25,114,298, 462,622,074 98% 078\\n\\nI observed that Investment servicing and monitoring was the most affected where LGs did not receive UGX.50,034,352.\\n\\nI further noted that out of UGX.25,576,920,152 released by MoFPED, 6 LGs failed to absorb UGX.462,622,074.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the Indicative Planning Figures are issued by MoFPED for which they had no control while under absorption was attributed to delayed completion of the infrastructure projects by the contractors and bottlenecks in the procurement process.\\n\\nI advised MoFPED to ensure that budget is funded in accordance with appropriation by Parliament while the MoLG was advised to ensure Accounting Officers adequately manage program implementation to eliminate unnecessary delays.\\n\\n**3.19.3 Implementation of LRDP activities**\\n\\nFrom the review of the status of implementation of infrastructure projects, performance improvement activities and investment servicing activities, I observed the following, details of which are in **appendix in 13 b.**\\n\\n- 18 LGs planned to undertake 109 activities under infrastructure projects. However, only 100 activities were implemented while 9 activities worth UGX.521,220,854 were not implemented.\\n\\n- 18 LGs planned to undertake 70 activities under performance improvement activities and all these activities were implemented. I also noted that 1 activity implemented worth UGX.3,000,000 was not eligible.\\n\\n- 18 LGs planned to undertake 53 activities under investment servicing and all these activities were implemented.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised MoLG to ensure that Accounting Officers manage program implementation to eliminate unnecessary delays in the procurements.\\n\\n**3.19.4 Transfer to LLGs**\\n\\nParagraph 1.3.2 of the guidelines provides the rationale for specific rule for sharing of the grant among levels of Local Government. Accordingly, the District is required to transfer 65% of the LRDP funds to LLGs and only retain 35%.\\n\\nI observed that 16 LGs transferred less funds to the LLGs than the 65% required by UGX.1,144,383,168 as indicated in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 43: Transfer to LLGs** Total releases Expected transfer to Actual transfers to Variance (UGX)** **received (UGX) LLGs 65% (UGX)**  \\n**LLGs (UGX)** 25,576,920,152** 16,624,998,099 15,480,614,931 1,144,383,168\\n\\nThis affected the implementation of service delivery programs at the Lower Local Governments.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the allocation of discretionary transfers is a mandate of MoFPED for which they only transfer to LLGs what has been pre- determined and released.\\n\\nI advised MoLG and MoFPED to harmonise the guidelines and the determination of the IPFs.\\n\\n**3.20 Implementation of Uganda Road Fund (URF) 3.20.1 Funding**\\n\\nI noted that 96 LGs budgeted to receive UGX.51,950,654,755 to cater for District/City/Municipal Council roads activities using road gangs and the force account mechanism. However, UGX.32,552,444,851 was received from Uganda Road Fund. Details are in **appendix 14 a.**  \\nThe failure to fully fund the road activities hindered access to service delivery centres like Schools, Hospitals and Markets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 44: Status of implementation of road activities** Category Planned Planned Actual Actual Length Annual length Expenditure - (KM) Expenditure - (KM) UGX** **UGX**  \\nRoutine Manual Maintenance 16,067 8,494,132,458 7,385 4,089,157,242 Routine Mechanized 6,720 15,394,408,459 4,924 10,306,553,352 Maintenance  \\nPeriodic Maintenance 845 8,675,569,761 378 4,376,557,279 **Total distance**  \\n23,632 32,564,110,678 12,687 18,772,267,873 Source: URF work plan and quarterly performance reports\\n\\nAccording to my inspection carried and progressive performance reports, I have observed the following;\\n\\n- 89 LGs planned to maintain 16,067 km under routine manual maintenance at a cost of UGX. 8,494,132,458, however only 7,385 km (46%) were maintained at cost UGX.4,089,157,242 (48%).\\n\\n- 90 LGs planned to maintain 6,720 km under routine mechanised maintenance at a cost of UGX.15,394,408,459, however only 4,924 km (73%) were maintained at cost UGX.10,306,553,352 (67%).\\n\\n- 45 LGs planned to maintain 845 km under periodic maintenance at a cost of UGX.8,675,569,761, however only 378 km (45%) were maintained at cost UGX. 4,376,557,279 (50%).\\n\\n- 88 LGs did not budget for routine manual, routine mechanise and periodic maintenance of roads despite the destruction of a number of roads by the rainy seasons. There is a risk that the roads will further deteriorate given the meagre resources. Access to service delivery centres like Schools, Hospitals and Markets is hindered.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer attributed this to late release of funds and inadequate and unmaintained road construction equipment.\\n\\nI advised the MoFPED timely release appropriated funds for the implementation of planned road activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\nmaterial misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n**Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements**\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda.\\n\\nThe Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements of Local Governments in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Local Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process.\\n\\n**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of local government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the local government’s internal control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to fail to deliver its mandate.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n**Other Reporting Responsibilities**\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19(1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of the Local Government Consolidated Financial Statements that; except for the matters raised in the compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the Local Government consolidated financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the consolidated financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.21 Transfer of Accounting Officers in Local Governments**\\n\\nSection 45(5) shall be responsible and personally accountable to parliament for the activities of a Vote.\\n\\nSection 43 (3) requires an Accounting Officer to enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a financial year.\\n\\nDuring the audit, I noted that the MoLG made frequent transfers of Accounting Officers from one LG to another. In the case of the LGs of Bulisa DLG, Hoima DLG and Fort Portal City, Amuria DLG, Mityana DLG, Butebo DLG, Kabarole DLG and Kitagwenda DLG, two to four Accounting Officers were posted within the same financial year.\\n\\nThe above disrupts implementation of activities thus affecting service delivery and accounting for funds which may in the long run hinder attainment of strategic objectives in the affected LGs. In some cases, it was noted that the Technical Planning Committee (TPC) structures are not fully constituted to lead implementation of the budgets without continuity of service and guidance by the Chief Administrative Officer.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that it was the mandate of MoFPED and MoLG to appoint and transfer Accounting Officers respectively.\\n\\nDuring my interaction with MoLG, the PS acknowledged the effect of the anomaly on service delivery and stated that the challenge can be solved by strengthening the administrative structure by recruiting substantive heads of departments. The PSST also acknowledged the observation and promised to engage the MoLG on the matter.\\n\\nI advised the MoLG to streamline the transfer of LG Accounting Officers to ensure continuity in service delivery with minor interruptions. The ministry should also liaise with MoPS and MoFPED to provide guidance and funding to strengthen the Technical Planning Committees (TPCs) for all LGs.\\n\\n**3.22 Risk management in LGs**\\n\\n---\\n\\nthe preparation and application of the risk mitigation plans in the financial year 2022/23.

Muwanga **AUDITOR GENERAL**\\n\\n30 th December, 2022\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.0.** REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022**\\n\\n**4.1.** Review of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises**\\n\\nAccording to Section 3 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended); “A Public Corporation means an authority established by an Act of Parliament other than a local Government which receives a contribution from public funds, and any public body which in a financial year receives any income from public funds”. Similarly, “A State Enterprise means a body established under any Act other than the Company’s Act or a local Government council, and a company registered under the company’s Act in which the Government or a state enterprise has controlling interest”.\\n\\nIn line with the PFMA, 2015, I reviewed the Consolidated Summary Statement of the Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises for the year ended 30 th June 2022, and noted the following;\\n\\n**a)** Completeness of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises**\\n\\nSection 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires the Accountant General, within three months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Minister responsible for Finance and the Auditor General the consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of Public Corporations, State Enterprises and Companies where Government has controlling interest.\\n\\nFurthermore, Section 51(2) of PFMA, 2015 provides that, the Accounting Officer of a public corporation shall, within two months after the end of each financial year, using the format prescribed by the Accountant General, prepare and submit to the Accountant General, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 46: Entities which did not submit summary statements** **S/N** Enterprise**\\n\\n1.

Housing Finance Investments\\n\\nIn absence of the summary performance of the above mentioned corporations, the consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises does not reflect the accurate status of government ownership and interest.\\n\\nIn addition, I noted that Government does not maintain a comprehensive database of Public Corporations and State Enterprises to enable independent verification of the number of entities consolidated in the summary statement.\\n\\nIn the absence of a comprehensive database, I was not able to ascertain the completeness of the submitted consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporation and state enterprises.\\n\\nI advised the Accountant General to establish a comprehensive database for all Public Corporations and State Enterprises which should profile entities by capturing information, such as; Name of entity, Business/Industry, Location, Shareholding, Share Capital, Directors, E-mail addresses, among others, to enable the conduct of an independent verification.\\n\\n**b)** Review of the Process of Consolidation of the Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 47: Inconsistencies in the submitted information** SN Entities Surplus/Deficit Net Worth** Accounta Audited Variance Accounta Audited Varianc nt Accounts (B-A) nt Accounts e (D-C) General (B) General (D)  \\n(A) UGX Bn UGX Bn (C) UGX Bn UGX Bn UGX Bn  \\nUGX Bn  \\n1 Bank of Uganda 477.168 501.982 24.814 3,771.135 3,780.067 8.932 2 Electricity (0.659) (0.709) (0.050) 36.441 36.391 (0.050) Regulatory  \\nAuthority  \\n3 National Water 6.874 (38.866) (45.740) 1,438.149 1,392.544 (45.605 & Sewerage ) Corporation  \\n4 Mandela 78.786 78.786 - 258.741 258.390 (0.351) Stadium Limited  \\n5 The Micro (30.638) (11.101) 19.537 181.781 202.528 20.748 Finance Support  \\nCentre Ltd  \\n6 Post Bank 3.364 12.236 8.872 121.823 117.126 (4.697) Uganda Limited  \\n7 Pride Micro 10.803 11.788 0.984 155.212 153.559 (1.653) Finance Limited  \\n8 Uganda (0.146) (0.086) 0.060 169.390 169.488 0.098 Electricity  \\nDistribution  \\nCompany  \\nLimited  \\n9 Uganda (39.568) 27.863 67.430 793.181 860.611 67.430 Electricity  \\nGeneration  \\nCompany  \\nLimited  \\n10 Uganda (14.929) 37.703 52.632 1,710.606 1,763.238 52.632 Electricity  \\nTransmission  \\nCompany  \\nLimited  \\n11 Uganda National (1.356) (1.356) (0.000) 564.090 564.090 (0.000) Oil Company  \\nLimited  \\n12 Housing Finance 49.042 40.975 (8.067) 274.255 278.692 4.437 Bank Ltd\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.2 Review of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda (GoU) owns shares in a number of Public Corporations and State Enterprises. These enterprises, which are independently managed, are supposed to operate efficiently, make profits and pay dividends to Government. Their financial performance is therefore of interest to Government.\\n\\nAs noted in my previous reports, the Government Consolidated Summary Statement of financial performance of public corporations and State enterprises only reports on; government shareholding, total income, total expenditure, dividends declared, retained earnings, and net worth of entities. However, key performance assessment parameters, such as; profitability, return on assets, liquidity assessment, and debt analysis are not reported on. As a result, I computed these ratios using audited financial statements for further analysis of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises.\\n\\nI assessed a total of 22 entities out of the 50 Public Corporations and State Enterprises. From the financial performance analysis undertaken, I noted the following;\\n\\n**a) Profitability of Enterprises**\\n\\nI analysed profitability of 18 public corporations and state enterprises and noted that only ten (10) made profits/surplus in the year under review, with Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), Uganda Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL) and NEC Luwero Industries Limited posting profits of UGX.37.7Bn, UGX.27.9Bn and UGX.7.9Bn, respectively. I further noted that Mandela National Stadium registered a surplus of UGX.78.8Bn from UGX.1Bn posted in the previous year on account of government support of UGX.80Bn received during the year. Table below refers.\\n\\nIn comparison with the previous year, a number of state enterprises and corporations including; UNOC, UEDCL, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC) recorded significant reductions in losses from the previous year, while entities including NEC Luwero Industries Limited and NEC Farm Katonga Limited registered improved profit positions of over 100% from the previous year. This was mainly attributed to the recovery of the related industries from the negative effects of COVID-19.\\n\\n---\\n\\naffect the entities’ ability to meet future obligations or investments.

With such measures and strategies, UACC is optimistic  revenue performance will be achieved going forward. that the budgeted addition, the Board approved the Corporation’s 5-year Business Strategy and Investment Plan in January, 2022. 14 Uganda Air -9.039 -7.694 17 Cargo  Corporation In |<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| 15 | Uganda | -9.345 | - | -52 | Management explained that the UBC Act |  \\n|| Broadcasting |<| 19.320 |<| 2005 vested the Corporation with all the |  \\n|^| Corporation |<|<|<| Assets and liabilities of the Former UTV and |  \\n|^| (UBC) |<|<|<| Radio Uganda.

However, there is a significant reduction of the deficit from last year by 60.81%.

However, the profitability of Pride Microfinance declined by 7% from the previous year. The details are shown in the table below;\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the entities to develop clear strategies to improve operations and adopt efficient financial management practices to lower operating costs and increase revenue generation. Government should also consider recapitalizing the most affected entities to revamp their operations.\\n\\n**b) Return on Assets**\\n\\nThe Return on Assets (ROA) shows the percentage of how a company’s assets are generating revenue. It measures management’s efficiency in using the enterprise’s assets to generate earnings. Although companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets, ROAs below 5% are generally considered inadequate.\\n\\nI assessed the ROAs of 16 enterprises/corporations and noted that Six (6) entities, including; The Microfinance Support Centre Ltd, Mandela National Stadium, NEC AGRO SMC Limited, Insurance Training college, NEC Construction Works & Engineering Limited, and Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation posted a favourable ROA of over 5%. however, ten (10) enterprises/corporations registered a poor performance on ROA of below 5%. The worst performing enterprises were; Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Uganda Railways Corporation, Kilembe Mines Limited, Uganda National Airlines Company Limited and Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC).\\n\\nThe noted performance was mainly attributed to low revenue performance and high cost of operations for entities such as UBC, Uganda Airlines, CAA and Uganda Railways Corporation among others. For the electricity sub-sector, the low ROAs were attributed to a number of running projects which are still under Work in Progress (WIP) and not generating revenue (UEGCL & UETCL) and desire by GoU to reduce the electricity tariff which limits profitability of the related entities. For Kilembe Mines, the entity has continued to post a negative ROA mainly due to the fact that the mine is still under care and maintenance without the core business activity of mining due to the delayed divesture process.

The details are shown in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 51: Return on Asset for the Financial Institutions** **No. Entity** Return On Asset (%) Response** **2021/2022 2020/21**  \\n1 Uganda  \\nDevelopment Bank\\n\\n5.3 2.91 No management response\\n\\n2 Housing Finance 4 2.27 The performance was attributed to an Bank  \\nincrease in the asset value from UGX 1,108.03bn in the prior year to UGX\\n\\n3 Pride Microfinance 3 Limited\\n\\n4 Post Bank Uganda 2.5 Limited\\n\\n1,304.16bn in the year under review.\\n\\n3.3  \\nThe reduction in the ROA was attributed to the low Earnings before interest and tax of UGX 11,440,731,000 compared to UGX 15,484,355,000 of the previous year.\\n\\n2.25  \\nThe Reduction in return on assets was attributed to an increase in the asset value by 9.49% (from UGX 674.555bn to UGX 745.29 bn in the year under review).\\n\\nI advised the entities to institute mechanisms to increase income generation from use of their assets.\\n\\n**c)** Dividends**\\n\\nI noted that, only Housing Finance Bank Limited declared a dividend pay-out of UGX.20.5Bn in the year under review. During the year, Uganda Property Holdings Limited and Housing Finance Bank Limited paid out dividends declared in the previous year totalling to UGX.400Mn and UGX.6.1Bn respectively.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**d) Liquidity Assessment**\\n\\nI analysed the ability of Public Corporations and State enterprises to meet their short- term financial obligations by comparing the current assets and current liabilities using the Current Ratio analysis. Generally, the ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities between 1.5 and 2 is desirable, although acceptable current ratios vary between different industries or sectors.\\n\\nI noted that thirteen (13) entities were above the ideal threshold, implying that they are able to meet their liabilities as they fall due. However, out of the 13 entities, 8 had excessively higher current ratios of 4 and above, these included UNOC, Mandela National Stadium, NEC Luwero Industries Limited and UEDCL among others. The very high current ratio implies that the Companies are not efficiently utilizing their current assets or short-term financing facilities.\\n\\nFive (5) entities had ratios below 1.5 and may have a challenge of paying their obligations as and when they fall due, these included UEGCL, UBC, Kilembe Mines Limited, NEC Construction Works & Engineering Limited and Uganda National Airlines Company Limited. The table below refers.\\n\\n**Table 52: Enterprise Liquidity** No Entity Current Ratio Remarks** **2021/2022**  \\n1 Uganda  \\n30.2  \\nNational Oil  \\nCompany  \\nLimited\\n\\n2 Mandela  \\n30.03 National  \\nStadium\\n\\n**2020/2021**  \\nN/A Management explained that the company’s current ratio was significantly impacted by the recognition of funds related to GOU’s first (1 st ) tranche of the 15% shareholding in EACOP Co through UNOC, of UGX.480.9 billion. For the period between July 2022 – November 2022, the company paid USD.62.3 Million (equivalent to UGX.230.4 billion), as cash calls to EACOP Co. The current ratio should return to expected levels as the company continues to meet its cash call obligations to EACOP Co.\\n\\n0.73 Management explained that the Board and Management engaged the Shareholders to recapitalize the company. As a result, Government funded the renovation and upgrade of Mandela National Stadium to international standards. This will make it marketable and attractive to business. Public Private Partnerships will be entered into to enhance the performance of the company.\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **No Entity Current Ratio Remarks** **2021/2022** 2020/2021** |<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|  \\n| 5 | Uganda | 10.4 | 6.8 | This performance was attributed to an |  \\n|| Electricity |<|<| increase in the Company’s current asset |  \\n|^| Distribution |<|<| during the year under review. |  \\n|^| Company |<|<|<|  \\n|^| Limited |<|<|<|  \\n| The reduction in the entity’s current ratio is attributed to an increase in the current assets from UGX.197.7Bn previous to UGX.272.97Bn.

The Uganda Development Bank had the highest ratio of 9.87 while Post Bank had the lowest ratio of 1.07.

Gearing (debt) ratio measures the proportion of the enterprises’ assets that are financed by debt. Although the risk levels vary from industry to industry, a debt ratio of more than 50% is considered undesirable.\\n\\nTwelve (12) out of the thirteen (13) Public Corporations and State enterprises assessed had debt ratios of less than 50% implying that owners’ equity was sufficient to cover total debt with the exception of NEC Uzima Limited which had a debt ratio above 50%. Further analysis noted that 11 Public Corporations and State enterprises had very low gearing levels below 10% indicating availability of untapped source of financing for growth.

Overall Conclusion/Recommendation**\\n\\nGovernment established public corporations and state enterprises with an objective of ensuring efficient and effective management of government operations while delivering services to the citizens. I noted that 56% of the assessed companies made profits while others were not making profits, thus affecting their return on assets, ability to pay dividends to Government, and ability to settle their obligations as they fall due. Therefore, these companies should put in place strategies to improve their performance and deliver to the expectations of Government. In addition, Government should develop appropriate financial and non-financial performance assessment indicators for each category of Public Corporations and State Enterprises to enable comprehensive and standardised performance assessment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**PART 3: SECTORAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CROSS CUTTING FINDINGS**\\n\\nThis part contains cross cutting key findings noted in the respective sectors and cross cutting service delivery issues in Local Governments.\\n\\n**A. Sectoral Key Findings** 1.0. PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT**\\n\\n**1.1. Delayed realignment of the Comprehensive National Development Framework (CNDPF) to the program planning approach**\\n\\nThe National Planning Authority developed a comprehensive national development framework in 2009 to guide planning in the country. This framework was developed based on the sector wide approach to planning and budgeting and should have been realigned to the new programme-based approach to planning and budgeting with the shift from the sector wide approach. At the time of writing this report (December 2022), the CNDPF was yet to be re- aligned to the new programme approach to planning and budgeting. The CNDPF therefore in its current form therefore cannot appropriately guide planning at both national and entity level. I advised the NPA to ensure that the CNDPF adequately realigned to the programme- based planning and budgeting adopted by Government.\\n\\n**1.2. Progress towards full implementation of the programme development approach**\\n\\nThe Programme Approach to planning was adopted so as to reduce the silo approach to planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring & evaluation (M&E), which always led to the duplication and wastage of resources. This approach was supposed to bring together stakeholders so as to achieve the delivery of common results, in an effective and efficient way. There have been areas of commendable performance towards transition by government to the programme approach for instance; Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) are providing the basis for planning, budgeting, implementation and M&E. In addition, the budgeting Systems have been adjusted to adopt the Programme approach which has improved the link between the Development Plan and the National Budget.\\n\\nDespite these achievements there are areas that need attention; there is still resistance from some stakeholders to the intervention, there are capacity gaps at the entity level regarding this approach, limited funding to programme secretariats which affects their operations, there no service delivery standards and outcome indicators for measuring performance. In addition, only four (4) of the twenty (20) programmes had functional programme working groups and working procedures within some entity operations are still not fully aligned to the programmed approach.\\n\\n---\\n\\nwere not registered and licensed, representing 48%. The balance of 134 schools were provisionally licensed. The provisional licenses for 102 out of the 134 schools had expired (exceeded the two years in operation) and had not been renewed, implying that the schools were operating illegally.\\n\\nI further noted that except for the schools which were issued closure notices as far back as 2018 but are still operating, other schools had never been issued closure notices by KCCA. The above inactions affected service delivery, and the education service standards in the city schools are at risk of declining to worrying levels. This was attributed to the inadequate monitoring and enforcement by the KCCA education department. I advised the Accounting Officer to enhance the monitoring and enforcement of by the education department to ensure that all schools are dully licenced and registered.\\n\\n**1.4. Functionality of District Service Commissions**\\n\\nI noted that several Districts and Cities had not constituted Service Commissions contrary to section 54 (1) of the Local Government Act 1997. The table below refers\\n\\n**Table 56: Constitution and functionality of Service Commissions**  \\n**Status of DSC**  \\n**No of Districts &** %age of total**\\n\\nFunctional and fully Constituted-(5 members) Functional but not fully constituted (4 members)- Functional but not fully constituted (3 members) Functional but not fully constituted (2 members)\\n\\n**Cities** DSCs** 37 26 46 32 59 41 2 1 Not functional 1 1 **Total 145 100**\\n\\nFailure to constitute District and City Commissions affects service delivery since recruitment, promotion and confirmation of staff cannot not be undertaken.\\n\\nI advised MoLG to ensure that going forward all districts have fully functional district service Commissions as required by law.\\n\\n**1.5.** Review of the Operations of the Kampala District Land Board**\\n\\nThe Kampala District Land Board is mandated by Section 54 of the Land Act to manage all public land within Kampala on behalf of the citizens. I reviewed the operations of the board for the financial years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 and noted that the board did not have a substantive secretary, and there were no minutes for some of the meetings of the board. Further, the board had not prepared annual reports for the two years reviewed nor did the board prepare financial statements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.0. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION**\\n\\n**a)** Review of Operations of missions**\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nI noted that a number of Missions signed agreements with Insurance Companies for the provision of medical services to the Mission Officials. However, most of the insurance covers given to the foreign service officers did not cover heart diseases, diabetes, and major operations. As a result, officers have been forced to use their personal funds which is very costly for the foreign service officers. In some cases, the foreign service officers are forced to seek for refunds which contravenes the Public Service Standing Orders.\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nPPDA issued abridged PPDA guidelines to be used by missions when undertaking procurements outside Uganda. These guidelines are however impractical in most cases given the unique circumstances and procurement requirements in the different host countries. As a result, there has been a lot of non-compliance to these guidelines.\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nA review of the mission work plans and budgets revealed that most of missions were not provided with capital budgets in the past three years. As a result, missions were unable to undertake activities of a capital nature such as renovations of chanceries and offices, procurement of vehicles, and procurement of furniture. This undermines the efforts of promoting Uganda’s image abroad.\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nI noted that Government continues to receive offers inform of trade opportunities, scholarships, financial offers among others. I however observed that Government does not have a comprehensive and effective system of follow-up on such offers. As a result, a number of offers have expired without action being taken by Government. This results in loss of a many opportunities for the country.\\n\\n(v)\\n\\nAt the end of every financial year Missions are required to return unspent funds back to the UCF. However, a comparison between the amounts wired back as per the financial statements and the Navision system and the amount received as per the actual receipts given by treasury shows that the value of these transfers is lost through exchange losses and bank charges. A review of funds returned by a sample of six missions revealed that UGX.15.8Mn was lost in bank charges and foreign exchange losses on various transactions made to return these unspent balances in two financial years.\\n\\n---\\n\\ncontravenes the constitution. I advised the Electoral Commission to engage stakeholders particularly MoFPED and Parliament for provision of resources to have these elections concluded.\\n\\n**3.0. AGRICULTURE SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Status of the Sugarcane production project in Northern Uganda**\\n\\nGovernment of Uganda owns 40% of the shares in Horyal Investments Holdings Company Limited (HIHC) whose main business is the establishment and running of the Atiak Sugar Factory. During the year Government allocated UGX 108Bn for purchase of agricultural mechanisation equipment to be given to HIHC under a finance lease arrangement.\\n\\nAtiak sugar factory was an intervention started by Government under the sugar cane out growers scheme. It started at the pioneer sugarcane production site in Atiak sub county Amuru District, and subsequently expanded to two additional sites in Lamwo district, namely, Palabek Kal (Lamwo-1) and Palabek Nyimur (Lamwo 2).\\n\\nAt inception in 2017, the intervention targeted to establish 13,841 acres of sugarcane at the pioneer site at Atiak, 15,000 acres at Palabek kal and 31,159 acres at Palabek Ogili site. By October 2019 only 7,906 acres of sugar cane had been established at the pioneer production site in Atiak after which the contractor ceased operations at the site. Similarly, by end of 2020 only 4,994 acres had been established at Palabek Kal Production site.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this report in December 2022, the project operations were currently on hold pending the acquisition of machinery through UDC. The project had not performed as expected due to the following;\\n\\n(i)  \\nSlow progress at the Atiak site was attributed to adverse weather, difficulties experienced by the contractor in mobilizing the required heavy machinery, and the heavy rains during season 2018B.  \\n(ii)  \\nSlow progress at the Palabek Kal production site was attributed to the shortage of seed cane within the proximity of the plantation site, difficulty in mobilizing labour and COVID 19.  \\n(iii)  \\nFire outbreaks in 2020 also wiped out a substantial acreage especially at the production site in Atiak.  \\n(iv)  \\nThe decision by the Shareholders (of HHIC Ltd) to halt operations after 2020 to allow for the proposed shift from the predominantly manual field operations mechanized farm operations under the oversite of Uganda Development Cooperation (UDC).\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Agriculture Value Chain Development (Production, Storage, Processing and Marketing) under the PDM for which an effective extension system will be required.\\n\\nI reviewed the current extension system and noted gaps for example; there were no performance indicators for extension workers, out of the desired 9,275 extension workers only 4,031 (57%) are available, the extension workers face challenges of transport, inadequate training among others. These challenges were due to insufficient budget allocations for this activity.\\n\\nI advised Government to prioritize this provision of extension services through recruitment and training of extension workers, and provision of transport since the success of the PDM is directly affected by the effectiveness of extension services.\\n\\n**4.0. JUSTICE LAW AND ORDER SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Review of the Performance of the Police Canine Unit**\\n\\nUganda Police Force had a total of One hundred seventy-nine (179) dogs in the police canine unit; I reviewed the management of the dogs by the UPF and observed the following.\\n\\nThe dogs are deployed in seventy-eight (78) policing districts out of the total of one hundred forty-five (145) Policing districts, representing a coverage of 58%. More than 50% of these are within Kampala. The unit requires three (3) veterinary doctors and 22 veterinary assistants to handle medical requirements for the dogs out of which the unit only has one (1) veterinary doctor and nine (9) assistants who are all based at the Canine headquarters in Kampala.\\n\\nThe unit has thirty (30) vehicles, seven (7) of which are grounded due to mechanical issues. Out of the remaining twenty-three (23), eleven (11) are allocated to Kampala, and the rest (52%) are spread across regions which affects the transportation of the dogs. The above was attributed to inadequate funding and prioritization of the unit within UPF. I advised the Accounting Officer to develop measures that will improve the geographical spread and availability of the dogs. There is also need to recruit more veterinary doctors and provide more vehicles to the unit to facilitate movement by the unit.\\n\\n**b )** Operations of the forensic laboratory**\\n\\nThe Police Forensics Unit was established to support criminal investigations by providing scientific means and study. This unit has four laboratories for; a) chemical, biological and radiology, b) questionable documents, c) criminal investigations, d) cybercrime and digital forensics. I reviewed the performance of these laboratories and noted the following;\\n\\n- Out of the 446 cases received for chemical, biological, and radiology analysis, only 203 were analyzed and concluded, representing a performance of 46%.\\n\\n- The questionable documents laboratory received 623 cases during the year 2021 in addition to a backlog of 1,161 at the beginning of the year. By the end of the year, only 511 cases were analysed and concluded, representing a performance of 29%\\n\\n- The crime investigations laboratory had 407 scene of crime officers and only 224 Scene of Crime Officer kits, 210 cameras and 108 motorcycles. This implies that the available kits and cameras are insufficient since each of the Officers is expected to have a kit and camera at least.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- The cybercrime and digital forensics laboratory had a case backlog of 478 at the beginning of the year 2021 and received 330 cases during the year, out of these only 224 were analysed and concluded, representing a performance of 28%.\\n\\nThis performance affects completion of cases and delays administration of justice. The Accounting Officer explained that this was due to lack of sufficient funds to equip the laboratories and hire more staff. I advised the Accounting Officer develop strategies of ensuring that these laboratories are well staffed and equipped in order to improve their effectiveness.\\n\\n**c)** Lack of a Laboratory Information Management System for the forensic unit**\\n\\nA Laboratory Information Management System is software that supports laboratory operations management. The software’s key functionality includes sample management, including tracking a chain of custody, workflow management, integration with other systems for real- time reporting, and any other information that the users may require to track.\\n\\nI observed that Uganda Police’s Forensics Unit does not have a Laboratory Information Management System to manage its operations. As a result, the unit relies heavily on manual recording, which is cumbersome, inefficient, and prone to errors. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the implementation of a Laboratory Information Management System is fast tracked for improved operations.\\n\\n**d)** Assessment of Road map for Mass Registration and Renewal of National IDs**\\n\\nNIRA is expected to undertake mass registration and mass renewal of the IDs that will be expiring in 2024. This will involve replacing old IDs with a next-generation ID system embedded with a microchip containing citizens’ electronic and biometric information.\\n\\nI noted that at the time of writing this report in December 2022, the Authority did not have a clear strategy and roadmap on how and when the new IDs will be rolled out, the costs involved, sensitization arrangements of the public were also not clear and other key activities such as signing of contracts for supply of the blank cards, procurement of equipment and recruitment of staff to manage the exercise were yet to be undertaken. There is a risk that the Authority will face challenges due to the large number of applications in 2024 which will result in processing delays, congestion and frustration of applicants.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to develop a comprehensive roadmap and strategy which will guide the planning and execution of this activity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**f)** Underfunding of liabilities arising from Court awards and compensations**\\n\\nI noted that nine (9) entities owed a sum of UGX.604,091,207,112 in outstanding court awards at the start of the year. Whereas these entities declared their liability fully to the Ministry of Finance for budgeting and settlement, only UGX.26,622,994,920 (4%) was provided, leaving a balance of UGX. 577,468,212,192 unbudgeted. Details are in the table below.\\n\\n**Table 57: Underfunding of liabilities from Court awards and compensations**  \\n**No. Entity**  \\n**Required funding Released funds -** Variance - UGX**\\n\\n1.

For instance, I noted that as of the 30 th of June 2022, the outstanding awards at MoJCA had accumulated interest amounting to UGX.115,667,496,357, which is 73% of the principal amount awarded.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers explained that the budgeting is not controlled by the respective entities but rather follow the budget ceiling provided by the Ministry of Finance; however, they pledged that they would continue to engage the relevant stakeholders, including The Presidential Advisory Committee on Budget (PACOB), the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and MoFPED, to provide sufficient budget provisions to cater for the settlement of arrears.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to engage MoFPED to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to settle the arrears.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOf these, the 23 cases in the Ministry of Justice had accrued interest of approximately UGX. 105,646,446,256 by the 30 th of June 2022.\\n\\nDelays to compensate affected parties result in further interest accumulation and deny timely delivery of justice. The Accounting Officers explained that whereas management is committed to the timely compensation of claimants, execution depends on the funding level availed by MoFPED.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to put in place a system that ensures that claimants are compensated in time.\\n\\n**5.0. INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Registration and certification of IT professionals and IT institutions without enabling regulation**\\n\\nSection 5(i) NITA-U Act, 2009 provides for the functions of the Authority to include; regulation of the information technology in Uganda in order to ensure its effective promotion and development. In addition, the Authority is required to act as an authentication centre for information technology training in Uganda in conjunction with the Ministry responsible for Education. However, I noted the following;\\n\\n- The Authority is currently registering professionals and the training institutions without prescribed regulations and standards. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since 2017, 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while the 11 are expired.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs advised that a regulation for IT Professionals would not suffice in governing and or regulating the IT Profession. They recommended the development of an ICT Professionals Bill, which the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance is spearheading.\\n\\n- Relatedly, the Authority has Service Provider Regulations but they lack timelines for certification of applicants. Consequently, clients of the Authority continue to operate without renewal of certification. From a sample examined, I observed that seven (7) companies were providing services to MDAs without certification.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHowever, I noted that UCC had not enforced the payment of a 2% gross annual levy on the licensed Television and FM radio operators, and no licensed Television and FM radio operator had submitted audited financial statements to the Commission for assessment.\\n\\nFailure to collect a 2% Gross Annual Revenue levy from the operators deprives the Commission of revenue hence affecting the implementation of activities to deliver services to the public.\\n\\nThe Accounting officer explained that the Broadcasters under their Umbrella the National Association of Broadcasters appealed the levy to the Minister of ICT & National Guidance and the appeal had not yet been resolved.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up on the outcome of the appeal from the Minister of ICT & National Guidance. In the meantime, the Commission should comply with the provisions of the existing law and institute a mechanism to levy a charge on the GAR of the operators.\\n\\n**c)** Operations of Smiles Telecommunications Limited**\\n\\nPart II of the Uganda Communications (fees and fines) Amendment Regulations 2020 states that an operator who without authority from the Commission discontinues its services licensed by the Commission is liable to a fine of up to 10% of the Gross Annual Revenue of the Operator.\\n\\nM/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited discontinued its operations in January 2022 without any authorization from the Commission. UCC however, did not suspend or revoke the license as guided by the Act. The Commission did not fine M/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited for violating the terms and conditions of the issued license.\\n\\nFurthermore, I noted that M/s Smiles Communications Uganda Limited has an outstanding obligation to UGX.227.300Mn and USD.505,079.47 payable to UCC. The Commission had not put any measures to recover this money from M/s Smiles Communications Uganda Limited. With the discontinuation of M/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited’s operations, the Commission is at risk of losing the outstanding revenue from the Company as well as loss of funds by the subscribers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt was further explained that Smile took ATC to court citing irregular and unfair treatment leading to the disconnection. The case is still ongoing. The Commission is monitoring the progress of the court case as it also engages both ATC and Smile for a possible amicable settlement of the underlying dispute.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting officer to put in place measures to ensure that the outstanding obligation is recovered from M/s Smile communications Uganda Limited, as I await the outcome of the ongoing initiatives on the matter.\\n\\n**d)** Lack of a policy on confiscated equipment**\\n\\nRegulation 112(1&2) of the Uganda Communications Commission (Licensing) Regulations, 2019 stipulates that the Commission may upon an investigation, confiscate from a licensed operator or agent of an operator or any person any apparatus which is possessed, installed, connected or operated unlawfully. The owner of any apparatus confiscated by the Commission may appeal to the Uganda Communications Tribunal against the confiscation within 30 days.\\n\\nOn several occasions, the Commission has confiscated equipment from operators however, there are no laid down procedures on how this equipment should be stored, returned to the operators, or even destroyed and who is responsible for the costs thereof. This is attributed to the failure of the Accounting Officer to come up with the procedures, for the Board’s approval, on how the confiscated equipment should be managed.\\n\\nThe lack of a policy may lead to misuse of the confiscated equipment and may deepen disputes and cause financial losses to Government.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the development of the policy on the management of the confiscated equipment was ongoing. The Policy was currently at the draft stage and management expects full approvals and policy to be in place by March 2023\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the development of a policy on the management of the confiscated equipment to mitigate associated the risks.\\n\\n**e)** Delayed completion of the National E-commerce Platform**\\n\\nThe Commission is spearheading a project to design, build and pilot an enterprise-grade smart E-commerce platform that is aimed at supporting SMEs in the informal sectors of the Agriculture, Retail, and Services industry in Uganda, in order to promote access to online sales, overcome challenges in delivering too hard to reach communities and to spur economic growth. The National E-commerce platform seeks to develop and deploy an ICT-enabled platform through which SMEs in the targeted informal sector can reach wider national and international markets, enable seamless payments and banking and obtain data-driven business insights and manage their sales inventories.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith delayed completion of NEP, SMEs in the informal sector lose out on the benefits of E- commerce.\\n\\nThe Accounting officer explained that the completion of the platform development processes was affected by a prolonged delay in procurement and delivery of the high-performance computer with graphics processing unit capability and hosting server, caused by the global scarcity of computer chips. The specialized computer and server were however received at the end of October 2022 and the team was now completing the final installation and configuration of the systems. The project steering committee had prepared a final report to Management for consideration of the recommendations on how the project would be implemented beyond the development phase.\\n\\nI advised the Executive Director to liaise with the project steering committee members to ensure that the NEP is completed and operational to support SMEs in the informal sector\\n\\n**f) Sharing of funds for information and communication technology development**\\n\\nRegulation 10 (1) (a) of the Uganda Communications (Universal Service and Access Fund) Regulations, 2019 provides that the Fund shall be utilised for information and communication technology development and rural communications. The percentage of the monies shall be shared between UCC and the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MoICT).\\n\\nHowever, the Regulation does not provide the sharing ratio and/or details against which the sharing would be based. During the year under review, the Commission budgeted to transfer UGX.6.5Bn to MoICT for its share from the information and communication technology development fund. The basis for arriving at this figure could not be supported.\\n\\nWithout the basis of the percentage sharing ratio, I was unable to establish how the amount transferred was arrived at. The lack of these ratios creates uncertainty in funding and may lead to inter-institutional funding conflict.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the proportions are based on the Ministerial guidance issued by the Minister following the enactment of the Communications Act of 2013 in respect of ICT development.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHowever, I noted that the projected reduction in cost of the internet to USD.20 per MBPS has not materialized, despite an increase in the number of sites connected to the NBI/EGI. Failure to reduce the internet cost will deny service delivery such as affordable communication and electronic learning in both public and private institutions country wide.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that NITA-U had engaged PSST on the same and the final discussions are underway to reduce the cost to USD.35.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the engagement with PSST and further urge the Accounting Officer to review the Internet Billing Card/costs to achieve the intended goal of increasing internet connectivity and affordability.\\n\\n**h)** Weaknesses in certifying ICT service providers**\\n\\nNITA-U’s strategic goal Part 1, aims to achieve a well-regulated Information Technology (IT) environment in Public and Private Sector, while Part 2, is to Strengthen capacity and awareness creation about IT in Uganda (both institutional and human).\\n\\nI sampled and observed from a total of Seven (7) companies that they were providing services to MDAs without certification by NITA-U and therefore compromising on the quality of services or goods received. A further review of the certification tool revealed that the Authority has been able to register 686 applications from inception and only 301 certifications are valid. The risk that unqualified and sub-standard works fill the market is highly likely and that insufficient consumer protection in regards to IT Services and Products goes un-monitored.\\n\\nManagement explained that NITA-U had instituted additional measures for renewal of certifications that had expired. They also continue to partner with key stakeholders such as Bank of Uganda, Lotteries and Gaming Regulatory Board, heads of PDUs, Professional Associations and others who require that their licensees/ bidders for IT Services obtain the NITA-U certification before they apply for a license/bid for services.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to institute measures of follow-up and management of the certification process of the IT service providers country wide.\\n\\n**i)** Refund to World Bank of ineligible EGP funds - USD.249,500**\\n\\nGovernment of Uganda (GoU) with funding under RCIP Phase V, invested in the E-Government Procurement system (e-GP system) and contracted a supplier at an initial system acquisition cost of USD.1,347,000. However, in a letter dated 26th June 2020 from the MoFPED and addressed to the Executive Director NITA-U, the government expressed concerns about the approach of the System provider and the long-term sustainability of the e-GP system project. Reference is also made to an Aide Memoire from the World Bank dated 8th – 12th February 2021, in which the World Bank acknowledged receipt of a termination request of the e- Procurement Contract.\\n\\n---\\n\\nUndertaking project expenditures without obtaining the required no-objections exposes the project to a risk of suspension by the World Bank of disbursements of funds to qualifying project expenditures that are supported by the Bank.\\n\\nManagement explained that the World Bank guideline was complied with. However, the payment was made based on the approval for termination of the contract by the Steering Committee under the MOFPED and a no objection by the World Bank.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always comply with the World Bank guidelines to avoid penalties that will cost Government.\\n\\n**6.0. ACCOUNTABILITY SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Un-funded Approved Consolidated Budget**\\n\\nThe PFMA, 2015 Section 15 (1) and (2) requires that after approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the Secretary to the Treasury shall issue the annual cash flow plan of the Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans, and recruitment plans approved by the Parliament. The annual cash flow plan shall form the basis for the release of funds by the Accountant General to the Accounting Officers.\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2021/2022, Parliament appropriated an initial budget of **UGX.44.778Tn** which was later revised to **UGX.51.562Tn** through a supplementary budget of **UGX.6.784Tn,** to finance Government expenditure as summarised in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 59: Government budget performance per spending category** Initi Revise Total Actual Unwarrant Unutilized % % al d warrant expenditu ed funds warrants warrante Warrants Budg budge s re (UGX (UGX Tn) (UGX-Tn) d funds spent** **et t (UGX Tn) E=B-C F=C-D**  \\n**(UGX (UGX Tn) D**  \\n**Tn) Tn) C**  \\n**A** B**\\n\\n**MDAs** 39.94 46.287 43.759 39.927 2.528 3.832 94.54 91.24 3  \\n**LGs** 4.836 5.275 5.095 4.508 0.18 0.587 96.59 88.48\\n\\n**Total 44.78 51.562 48.854 44.435 2.708 4.419 94.75 90.95 Source:** OAG analysis of the Government budget performance report\\n\\n---\\n\\nFailure to fully fund the revised budget affected the implementation of the planned activities which were intended to contribute to the achievement of the NDP III and Vision 2040.\\n\\nI advised Government to adopt prudent budgeting principles by periodically reviewing its priorities against the funding mix and ensuring that all supplementary appropriations are supported by new funding sources. Besides, Management should warrant funds based on the money available in the consolidated fund.\\n\\n**b)** Public debt portfolio analysis**\\n\\nThe reported total public debt as at 30 th June 2022 stood at **UGX.86.6Tn,** of which Domestic Debt Stock was **UGX.38.1Tn** and the External Debt Stock was valued at **UGX.48.5Tn.** This is an increase of **UGX.11.5Tn,** equivalent to 15.31% when compared to the debt stock of **UGX.75.1Tn** reported as of 30 th June 2021. Refer to Table below for details;\\n\\n**Table 60: Government Debt Stock** Financial year Domestic debt Foreign debt Total (UGX Tn) % change** **ended (UGX Tn) (UGX Tn)**  \\nJune 2022 38.1 48.5 86.6 15.3% June 2021 30.8 44.3 75.1 24.3% June 2020 18.0 38.2 56.9 23.5% June 2019 15.2 30.9 46.1 11.1% June 2018 13.1 28.4 41.4  \\n**Source:** Audited financial statements of Vote 130\\n\\nFrom the above analysis, it was noted that there has been a consistent increase in the total debt as evidenced by an increase of 109% in the five years from 2017/18 **(UGX.41.4Tn)** to **UGX.86.6Tn** as at 30 th June 2022. The net increase in debt is due to increased borrowing from both domestic and external sources, with domestic debt accounting for a higher increase. The composition and trend of debt are highlighted in the figure below;\\n\\nPublic debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of Government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, Bond switches, private placements, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. I advised that Government should prudently project and manage the funding mix as well as review its priorities to avoid escalation of debt beyond a sustainable level.\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 2019/20 18 2.5 16.0 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 2018/19 | 15.5 | 2.4 | 18.7 |  \\n| 2017/18  13.1 |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\nFrom the above, it is evident that domestic debt has kept growing over the years at an average rate of more than 23.1%.\\n\\nContinued reliance on Net Domestic Financing signals the Government’s borrowing appetite, whereby the market players are inclined to demand increased rates well aware of the fact that Government is in dire need to finance the budget.\\n\\nIn addition, commercial banks will prefer lending to the Government instead of the private sector thus crowding out the private sector.\\n\\nI have advised Government to consider initiating steps to reverse this trend and ensure fiscal budget discipline and promptly servicing a portion of such domestic obligations including interest.\\n\\n**d)** Assessment of debt sustainability i.Debt to GDP ratio**\\n\\nThe Debt to GDP ratio is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service provided). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a Country to pay both internal and external debt and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates to compensate for financing risk due to likely default or unnecessary debt extension.\\n\\nThough the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold.  \\nA review of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a consistent linear growth over five years and in the year under review, it was noted that Debt to GDP grew by 22% from 31% to 53%. The graph below illustrates the movement;\\n\\n**Graph showing Debt to GDP ratio** 200\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nFrom the above, it can be seen that though Uganda’s GDP has been increasing over the years since FY2016/17, its debt position has also increased. The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk factor of accumulation of unsustainable debt.\\n\\nThe Country is now at the set benchmark by the World Bank for unsustainable Debt. I noted that the country is already facing the impact of public debt which is evidenced by debt restructuring and the high cost of borrowing offered by the lenders. In the FY 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, Treasury restructured debt totalling to UGX.0.9Tn by way of bond switches that attracted an additional interest of UGX.1.2Tn.\\n\\nThe Government should consider exploring ways of reducing dependence on debt while exploring avenues of enhancing revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures and investments.\\n\\n**ii.Interest to total revenue ratio**\\n\\nThe country’s risk benchmark sets the maximum proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestic-raised component of the budget only. The table below shows the trend of the interest accruing against the risk benchmark over the 5 year period;\\n\\n**Table 62: Interest in the total revenue ratio**  \\n**Financial year Total domestic Total Interest – % of Interest** Benchmark** **Revenue – UGX-Tn to revenue**  \\n**UGX-Tn**  \\n2021/22 22.8 5.5 24.1 <12.5\\n\\n2020/21 19.9 3.98 20.0 <12.5 2019/20 17.5 2.5 14.2 <12.5 2018/19 17.1 2.0 11.71 <12.5 2017/18 15.2 1.9 12.73 <12.5\\n\\nThe interest-to-revenue surpassed the risk benchmark as illustrated in the graph above. During the year, **24.1% (UGX. 5.5Tn)** of the revenue collected was utilised towards the interest payments and **UGX.1.4Tn** in principal debt repayment representing 6% of the domestic revenue collected. Therefore **30.1% (UGX.6.9Tn)** of the total revenue collected was used to service the debt (principal and interest) leaving only **69.9% (UGX.15.93Tn)** available for funding other critical Government expenditures.\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnder-collection of revenue affects the overall delivery of Public services by Government and leads to the escalation of public debt as borrowing increases to close budget funding gaps.\\n\\nURA Management explained that the organisation is focused on closing all revenue collection loopholes by revamping the Business Intelligence tool (e-hub) into a data lake to facilitate big data analytics for compliance support in audits and investigations; Working with the Government to curb tax expenditures in the form of exemptions, allowances rate reliefs among others.\\n\\nI commended URA Management on the revenue collection improvements and urged the Accounting Officer to make all necessary efforts to close revenue collection loopholes to ensure sustainable collection of the planned revenue.\\n\\n**f) Pending Tax Appeals**\\n\\nA review of the tax disputes received and managed by Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) revealed that 163 cases with a value of **UGX.356.7Bn** were pending before the Tribunal. This was attributed to the inadequate numbers of Tribunal members that limit their ability to hear and make timely rulings for all the tax appeals the Tribunal receives timely. Included in the pending cases is one case for VAT and exercise duty amounting to **UGX.14.19Bn** which has been outstanding for more than 11 years. Below is the ageing list of tax cases;\\n\\n**Table 63: Ageing analysis for pending cases**  \\n**No of Details**  \\n**cases**  \\n15 Cases of more than 2 years  \\n23  \\nCases above 1 (one) year and less than 2 (two) years 125 Cases below one year\\n\\n**Taxes Amount in contention – UGX Bn** 85.8  \\n111.6  \\n159.3  \\n163 **Total 356.7 Source:** OAG Analysis\\n\\nLong outstanding tax disputes lock potential Government revenue that would have been used to deliver services and is a disincentive for effective tax mobilization.\\n\\nManagement explained that mediation has been adopted at the Tribunal and this has helped resolve 70% of the tax disputes. Management further explained that the TAT Act was amended this year in June 2022 to allow for 4 more members. However, the operationalisation of this has been pushed to the subsequent year when funds are available.\\n\\n- I noted that a total of **UGX.340Bn** in taxes had not been collected from Gold exports valued at **UGX.6.962Tn** for the year under review. Management attributed non- collection to the Minister’s statutory guidance of staying the implementation of the 5% export levy.\\n\\n- There was no documented step-wise processes on how the importation and exportation of precious minerals should be handled by the customs officials. The processes are not embedded in the customs business compendium despite precious minerals being of high value, exposing the Authority to a risk of loss of revenue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- I noted that the exportation of Gold was being processed manually, with only two entries captured during the year under review.\\n\\nThe Government is at risk of loss of revenue if the Minister’s statutory guidance is not reviewed and the processes are not enhanced.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to streamline documentation of mineral imports and exports and engage the Minister responsible to enforce the Mining (Amendment) Act 2021. In addition, the Authority should initiate to recover the taxes due up to the date when the new law became effective.\\n\\n**h)** Weaknesses in management of digital stamps**\\n\\nUNBS / URA and a Supplier executed a framework contract for the supply, implementation, training, commissioning, support and maintenance of a DTS Solution, dated 4 th October 2018, for a period of five (5) years, effective from the Go-Live Date at the unit prices specified in the Contract. The DTS solution involves affixing digital stamps (specialised paper stamps or digital imprints) on all excisable gazetted products as and when they are manufactured or imported with information being transferred to URA in near real-time. The solution enables the tracking and tracing of the product throughout the supply chain.\\n\\nThe digital stamp fees are collected by URA and remitted to the Supplier. The fees structure varies from commodity to commodity but includes **UGX.3** for UNBS conformity stamps. I reviewed the contract and noted that there was delayed implementation of the conformity stamps by Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) because of lack of the regulations.\\n\\nManagement attributed this delay to the long process of formulating regulations as required by the law. As a result, UNBS has failed to claim the conformity stamp levy totalling **UGX.19.754Bn.**\\n\\nFailure to implement Digital Conformity Stamps not only affects UNBS revenue performance but also derails the Governments focus on ensuring compliance to Quality Standards aimed at reducing substandard items in the market.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to expedite formulation of the Digital Conformity Stamps Regulations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI noted that the GOU in the FY 2020/21 decided to cancel three loans that had been contracted, as shown in the Table below;\\n\\n**Table 64: Cancelled loans**  \\n**S Loan particulars**  \\n**N** 1** Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant **2** Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant **3** KfW Grant Finance (Euros)  \\n**TOTAL**\\n\\nThe following observations were noted;\\n\\n**Loan Amount (Euro-** Date of signing** **Mn)**  \\n40  \\n25 November 2016 45  \\n09 December 2016 5.36  \\n22 September 2015 **90.36**\\n\\ni.  \\nI noted that from the date of execution of the said loan to the cancellation, the GoU had paid to the KFW a total of **UGX.3.967Bn** in commission fees for unutilised funds. This in effect caused a financial loss to the GOU of the said amount as there was no benefit for the said money. The failure to absorb the funds therefore can be categorised as a nugatory expense.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nIn a letter dated 14 th July 2022, the KFW indicated that the total amount payable for the cancellation of the loan would be **Euro.1,171,875** as cancellation and commitment fees. The said letter was countersigned by the Minister of Finance on 11 th July 2022.\\n\\niii.  \\nThe audit noted that the initial agreement entered into by the GOU and the KFW had a draw-down period of 30 th December 2021. Following the lapse of the draw-down period, the government successfully secured a renewal of the facility. The same facility was subsequently cancelled which cost the GOU a total of **Euro.1,171,875** (Equivalent to **UGX.4.657Bn).** This payment amounts to an unnecessary payment which could have been avoided either by allowing the facility to lapse or not renewing it before cancellation.\\n\\niv.  \\nThere is no evidence that the Minister sought the advice of the Attorney general before the cancellation process was undertaken.\\n\\nv.  \\nA review of the status reports provided to the MOFPED by UEGCL on the execution of the project revealed that the UEGCL had expensed some funds totalling **UGX.2.695Bn** towards the compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and acquisition of land. This indicates that the additional expense of GOU if not properly secured could also be a nugatory expenditure by government.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Tororo – Gulu Railway Line will go a long way to divert cargo from road to rail and create an alternative mode of transport which is cheaper and more environmentally friendly because of less emission of green gasses. This route will also provide a link between the port of Mombasa and Northern and Eastern Uganda, as well as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo\\n\\nOn 16 th December 2019, The Government of Uganda signed a grant financing agreement of up to 34.6 million Euros with the European Commission. The grant termination date was 10 th December 2023. I noted the following;\\n\\n**k)** Failure to honour GOU co-financing obligation leading to termination**\\n\\nIn the Grant agreement signed between the GOU and the EU the parties resolved that the total cost of the project would be **Euros.34,600,000** of which the GOU would be responsible for the financing of a total of **Euros.13,100,000.**\\n\\nContrary to article 65.1 of the grant agreement, GOU defaulted on their contribution to payment of the contractor. This resulted in the termination of the contract by the contractor. By the time of termination, **Euros.3,112,726.52** was due to the contractor. As at 30 th August 2022, only 15.47% work had been completed. Article 65.3 states that in the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the contractor for any loss or damage the contractor may have suffered. The maximum amount shall be 10% of the contract price.\\n\\nAs a result of the termination, the Government of Uganda will incur termination damages up to 10% (Euros.3,933,775.6). According to the Monthly progress report no. 34 of August 2022, Termination claim 3 had not yet been submitted by the contractor for final determination and estimation of amounts due. A review of the Treasury Operations financial statement indicated that no contingent liability had been provided for/ disclosed with respect to the outstanding claim.\\n\\nI advise the Accounting Officer to provide for the liability in the financial statements.\\n\\n**l)** Conflict of PFMA and Financial Institutions Act**\\n\\nSections 35 and 81 of the PFMA 2015 provide guidance on the processes and procedures to be taken when executing a proposal to write off a public asset by the GOU. This indicates that unless the Parliament resolves and authorizes a write-off of any asset, no write-off can be undertaken with the limited exception of a write-off by the minister under section 35(4).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**7.0. ENERGY SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Rampant Vandalism of the Electricity Infrastructure**\\n\\nI noted cases of increased vandalism on UETCL’s installations specifically the transmission lines, substations and towers. Examples of stations which have been vandalised include; Namanve substation - theft of capacitor banks, Queen’s way substation - theft of copper cables, Soroti substation - theft of transformer oil, NELSAP Transmission Line - destruction of towers and vandalism.\\n\\nIn the FY 2021/22 UETCL incurred UGX 494.15Mn to purchase Galvanized Angle bars to replace vandalized tower members excluding replacement costs. Further analysis revealed that the company also incurred UGX 1.56Bn in replacement costs on assorted transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021.\\n\\nAccording to a management report, 135 towers were vandalised and re-instated in the period between May 2021 and June 2022. In the last four (4) months preceding December 2022, 255 (53% of the prior year number) had been vandalised and reinstated.\\n\\nIn addition Management asserted that it had spent UGX 3.86Bn to provide a temporary solution in form of wooden structures so as to restore supply. The estimated cost of replacing a 220kV tower is UGX. 220Mn and UGX. 120Mn for a 132kV tower. This translates to UGX. 12.72Bn for the collapsed towers after vandalism within a period of two years.\\n\\nThe total estimated cost including the cost of repairs, replacement and security is UGX 16.58Bn as at 15 th December 2022.\\n\\nFailure to stump out the vice by Government may cause severe socio-economic consequences including retarding economic growth.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officers in the electricity sub-sector explained that the recent vandalism was unprecedented, and it has become a national security matter whereby Government security agencies have been asked to take up the matter, and a number of arrests made.\\n\\nI advised Government to ensure that the security of the power infrastructure is enhanced to safeguard the integrity of the power lines, substations and the attendant equipment.\\n\\n---\\n\\nmaintenance manuals to guide the staff on the safety precautions that needed to be undertaken.\\n\\nThere is a risk that if these snags are not addressed in a timely manner, the costs of the owners’ engineer and feasibility of the project may affect the overall plant effectiveness. Furthermore, the risk of the flooding re-occurring cannot be ruled out if the causes are not clearly established and rectified in a timely manner.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the EPCC has committed to fix all outstanding defects before the defects liability period ending 31 st March 2023. UEGCL is preparing a claim against EPCC.\\n\\nI advised the responsible Accounting Officer to ensure that the snags are rectified in time. Going forward, a robust maintenance place should be put in place and implemented.\\n\\n**8.0. GENDER AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Inadequate measures to curb the increasing number of street children**\\n\\nThe Ministry did not regularly carry out activities to control and manage street children by identifing gaps and suggesting recommendations towards eliminating them and improving their welfare. Whereas the Ministry estimates that the number of street children could be 1,000, only 292 could be accounted for leaving 708 children untraceable.\\n\\nThis was caused by inadequate allocation of financial resources and staffing gaps for community development workers at the districts to carry out their activities relating to child protection.\\n\\nThere is a risk that the street children will continue to be a challenge to the country which could eventually result into increased urban crimes.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry had a strategy for management of street children which is used alongside other Policies and enacted laws like the National Child Policy 2020 and its Implementation Plan (FY 2020/2021-2024/50, Practical Guidelines for Working on Street Children, Prevention of Trafficking in Persons (PTIP) Act, 2009, Kampala Capital City Child Protection Ordinance 2022 and the Local Government Act (1997 as amended- Child Care and Protection is a decentralized Service under Schedule II). He further explained that the Ministry had withdrawn a total of 1,582 children from Kampala streets, transported and rehabilitated them at Kobulin Youth Skilling Centre, Napak District during the period 2017 to 2022.  \\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage relevant stakeholders and institute measures to eliminate or control existance of street children. In addition, the Accounting Officer should consider engaging the source communities and address causal factors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**9.0. LAND SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Management of Public Land**\\n\\nGovernment of Uganda owns land both in Uganda and abroad. This land is held for purposes of service delivery to Citizens. Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) requires the Accounting Officers across Government to be responsible for the management of the land under their custody. A review of the Management of Public land in 56 selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Authorities (LAs), over a four year period ending 30th June 2022, revealed the following;\\n\\n**(i)** Planning & Budgeting for Land Acquisition**\\n\\nInstruction 3.9.5 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 requires the budget estimates to be based on the pre-determined objectives and outputs as provided in the strategic plans of the sector or entity. A review of a sample of 56 MDA’s and LA’s, revealed that 40.47 hectares of Government land acquired at UGX 0.647Mn in the period under review were not adequately planned for in the various entity Strategic Plans and 6.4 hectares costing UGX 0.627Bn were acquired by MDAs and LAs but had not been adequately budgeted for. The un-budgeted acquisitions were not aligned to the development goals and priorities as per the NDP III, sector, entity plans and budgets.\\n\\nI also noted that out of the total budget of UGX 8.9Bn for land acquisition, UGX 7.3Bn (82%) was availed, resulting into a shortfall of UGX 1.6Bn (18%). Funding shortfalls resulted into Government’s failure to acquire 45 hectares of land planned for infrastructure development to enhance service delivery. The funding gap was attributed to budget cuts due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to engage all Accounting Officers and Parliament to ensure that all budget allocations are aligned to the Development Goals as set out in the NDP III. In addition, I advised the PS/ST to ensure that the planned and appropriated allocations for Land acquisition are released.\\n\\n**( ii)** Registration, titling and reporting of land**\\n\\nSection 49 (c) of the Land Act, Cap 227 requires the Uganda Land Commission to procure certificates of title for land vested in or acquired by the Government.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFurthermore, whereas Government leased out several pieces of land, I noted irregularities such as; double allocation of leases, allocation of leases by entities without mandate to lease out Government land, breach of lease terms and conditions. I further noted MDAs and LGs with expired and un-renewed leases and non-payment of lease rentals.\\n\\nThis has led to increased risk of litigation and associated costs, loss of land and revenue, thereby negatively affecting service delivery to the citizens.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to enforce the securing of titles for all Government land and proper recording of Asset registers by the respective MDA’s and LG’s as well as maintenance of a comprehensive national register for Government land by the ULC.\\n\\n**(iii) Utilisation and encumbrance of land**\\n\\nInstruction 16.13.12 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that to control an asset, a Government entity should usually be the predominant user of the asset.\\n\\nOut of a sample of 56 MDA’s and LG’s, I noted that 19 pieces of land measuring approximately 20.786 hectares out of the 631 pieces of land measuring approximately 2384.78 hectares were not utilized by 12 entities at the time of Audit. This was majorly attributed to inadequate funding to develop the land as planned.\\n\\nUn-utilised land if not secured is susceptible to loss via encroachment or land grabbing.\\n\\nIn addition, 2 entities had a total of 4 pieces of land measuring approximately 961 hectares which had encumbrances in the form of; encroachment by the local population, court injunctions and claims by other parties.\\n\\nI advised the PS/ST to harmonize the planning, funding, acquisition and utilisation of all Government land. This will minimize instances of wastage though non-utilisation and loss of public resources.\\n\\n**(iv)** Management of Land by Uganda Land Commission**\\n\\nSection 49 of the Land Act Cap 227 requires the Uganda Land Commission to hold and manage all the land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government including land acquired by the Government abroad.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to comply with the Act. In addition, Government should harmonise the requirements of the Land Act and other statutes. The MDAs/LGs should institute measures to ensure that their land is safeguarded.\\n\\n**(v)** Irregularities in Management of leased Land**\\n\\nRegulation 6 of the Land Regulations, 2004 requires a lease offer made by a Board or the Commission to communicate the offer, stating the terms and conditions of the offer conditioned upon payment of fees and other charges, in full or by instalment.\\n\\nI observed that 5 entities leased 175 pieces of land measuring approximately 60,518.826 hectares in the period. However the following irregularities were noted;\\n\\n- 2 entities without mandate to lease out Government land allocated 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares.\\n- 2 entities allocated 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares to more than one beneficiary.\\n- 5 lease agreements were in breach of lease terms and conditions for example; expired and un-renewed leases and non-payment of lease rentals.\\n- ULC leased out 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares without consulting the primary user agencies.\\n\\nThe above irregularities expose Government to risks of litigation and associated costs and loss of public land.\\n\\nI advised the Boards and Commision to enforce proper management of leases for Government land.\\n\\n**b)** Under utilization of funds by USMID – AF project**\\n\\nA total of UGX.339.9Bn (USD.92Mn) remained unutilised over a period of three years (2019/2020 - 2021/2022) even when there are signed commitments for infrastructure contracts and the funds have not been released to the implementing entities.\\n\\nThese funds included UGX 268Bn for 22 Program Cities/MCs and UGX.64Bn for the 8 refugee hosting districts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**10.0. EDUCATION SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Delayed Finalisation of Education Policies and other frameworks**\\n\\nDuring the previous financial year (2020/2021), the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) drafted several policies, including; the National Inclusive Education Policy; the National Higher Education Policy; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy; the Education Management Information System (EMIS) Policy; the Instructional Materials Policy; and the School Health Policy, which were not concluded.\\n\\nIn the year under review, the Ministry planned to conclude several policies and draft others, such as; National Curriculum Assessment, and Placement Policy; School Feeding Policy; Inspection and Quality Assurance Policy, the private Education Provision Policy, among others.\\n\\nAdditionally, I noted that at the time of concluding the audit (December, 2022), the Ministry had not concluded the development and issuing of some of the planned policies, bills and other frameworks. For instance; some draft policies have been pending for a while, only one out of the eight policies have been passed and a number are pending the issuance of the certificate of financial implication. The details are shown in the table below;\\n\\n**Table 65: Status of development of some policies under the MoES** **S/N POLICY PURPOSE STATUS**  \\n1  \\nGovernment White  \\nPaper on Education  \\n(1992)\\n\\n2 Government White Paper on Higher\\n\\nProviding Government \\uf0be The Education Policy Review Commission was with a holistic  \\nestablished under Legal Notice No. 5 of 2021. understanding of the \\uf0be The process of reviewing the 1992 education value chain in  \\nGovernment White Paper on Education is on- the country including going.  \\nEducation Planning and  \\nPolicy Analysis  \\nProviding Government \\uf0be The Government White Paper on Higher with a holistic  \\nEducation was approved by Top Management Education understanding of the Meeting.  \\nUniversity Education \\uf0be Pending the costing of the Whitepaper and and other Higher Policy implications.  \\ninstitutions  \\n\\uf0be Needs a Certificate of financial implication.  \\n3  \\nNational Teachers’ Bill To provide a legal \\uf0be The Minister issued drafting instructions to framework  \\non First Parliamentary Counsel to draft the management of National Teachers’ Bill per the approved teachers including their Principles.  \\neducation and training  \\n4  \\nTechnical and Vocation To provide a legal \\uf0be The Minister issued drafting instructions to Education and Training framework  \\n(TVET) Bill.  \\nmanagement\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **S/N POLICY PURPOSE STATUS** |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| sustainable education in the country Finance, Development.

In addition, the monitoring and supervision of education activities becomes a challenge in the country.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry had not concluded the development of the planned policies mentioned. This was due to the prolonged process of developing them which involves consultations with several stakeholders including the public to solicit their views and for ownership. This is a requirement by Cabinet before they are submitted for approval. However, all the policies mentioned had been consulted upon and were awaiting approval by Cabinet.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with all stakeholders and fast-track the completion and approval of the above mentioned policies and other frameworks to enable efficient and effective deliverance of educational services.\\n\\n**b )** Delayed Review of the Education Curricula for the different education institutions**\\n\\nA review of the Needs Assessment study report on Uganda Community Polytechnic Education dated February 2022, indicated that the Curriculum review of the Uganda Community Polytechnic Curriculum was last undertaken in 2008. In the year under review, I noted that only three (3) (5.7%) courses had been reviewed out of the fifty-two (52) courses. This has an impact on the quality of trainees and graduates and their competitiveness in the job market.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFurthermore, I noted that there was no Business and Technical Vocational Qualifications Framework in place rendering it difficult for UBTEB to effectively execute its mandate. This renders it difficult to equate qualifications hence limiting competitiveness in the global job market. Relatedly, there was no central database for technical education and training, and national qualifications. The lack of a centralized technical qualification database affects the Government\\'s ability to have an accurate, reliable, and robust data on all qualifications in the country that facilitates comparability/equation, recognition and global placements in the job market.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to address the above fore metioned challenges to enhance the quality of the learners and their competitiveness in the job market.\\n\\n**c)** Sports Management and Administration by the National Council of Sports (NCS)**\\n\\nI reviewed the mandate, operations and management of NCS and noted the following;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nWhereas NCS has the mandate to promote quality physical education and sports in the country, it was noted that there is inadequate sports management and administration. In the year under review, NCS released a sum of UGX.13.40Bn (100.3%) out of the budgeted UGX. 13.43Bn to a number of sports Associations and Federations.\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nA number sports associations and federations were facing structural and operational challenges, including the failure to properly account for the funds disbursed to them resulting into UGX. 270Mn remaining unaccounted for.\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nNCS regulates over 52 sports disciplines; however, there is currently a shortage of academies (grassroots sports schools) in a number of the disciplines. For example, whereas football and boxing disciplines had 77 and 57 sports academies, respectively, 25 sports disciplines had no sports academies at all.\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\nThere was inadequate technical capacity in terms of personnel with internationally accredited skills. There were few coaches, Umpires, referees and sports medical personnel for most of the sports disciplines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**11.0. WORKS SECTOR**\\n\\n**a) Loss on Compensation for Stolen Materials from Steel Companies- UGX.12,757,503,000**\\n\\nDuring the year, the Managing Director of Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) instituted an investigation on the stolen and recovered railway materials from two steel companies. However, the review of the investigation reports and other documents related to stolen and recovered railway materials revealed that URC went into an out of court settlement which resulted into a total compensation loss of **UGX. 12.76Bn** from both the two steel companies and an indication that the legal cases were mismanaged.\\n\\nManagement explained that the computation was based on sections that had been vandalised over the years and not the materials that the two companies were found with. This was done as a deterrent measure against the two companies in order to discourage them from buying vandalised materials. It was further explained that it is difficult to prove that the two companies were responsible for vandalising sections of the line yet the materials recovered were not for the whole section. The factory in Mukono negotiated to pay less as it claimed to be on the verge of bankruptcy due to Covid 19. Management considered it prudent to secure the settlement amount.\\n\\nI advised the Board to review the process of out of court settlement to ensure transparent and verifiable procedures. In the event that collusion is identified, appropriate action including recovery measures from responsible parties should be instituted.\\n\\n**b )** Loss of Abandoned Dismantled Railway Materials-EUR.3,083,846.54 and unrecovered advance payment of EURO 8,854,839.68**\\n\\nThe PSST/National Authorising Officer of the European Development Fund (EDF)-Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (PSST/NAO) signed a contract with a contractor on 21st November 2019 for Civil works for the Rehabilitation of the Tororo-Gulu Railway under contract reference number EUROPWAID/139549/IH/WRKS/UG at Contract price of EUR 39,337,756 (excluding VAT/other taxes). My review of the contract implementation revealed that after termination of the contract by the contractor, the contractor never handed over the demolished materials that were supposed to be used for reconstruction of the railway line. Evidence from supervising consultant indicated that 136,416 railway items equivalent to **Euro 3,083,846.54** had been stolen. Similarly, the Contracting Authority made 30% advance payment to the same contractor amounting to EURO 11,801,326.80, by the time of termination of the contract only **EURO 2,946,487.12** had been recovered with the balance **EURO 8,854,839.68** not yet recovered.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**c)** Loss of Potential Revenue from a Concession Agreement for Pamba Ferry**\\n\\nOn 18th May 2020, the Minister of State for Transport signed an agreement between the Government of Uganda and Mango Tree (U) Ltd, to rehabilitate and upgrade the Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba without recourse to public funds as a PPP. I however noted that there was no procurement process followed in identifying the company. I also noted that Mango Tree (U) Ltd incurred a verified amount of **UGX.10,618,736,676** to undertake the refurbishment, which funds are to be recovered from the collections charged by the firm during operations. Although the Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba operated during the year, there were no arrangements by URC in respect to monitoring of revenue collected by the operator of the vessel and also the revenue sharing terms which would allow both parties to mutually benefit as required in the agreement.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that engagements with the Ministry of Works and Transport will continue to ensure that a revenue sharing agreement is established.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer should establish a verifiable monitoring mechanism of the operations of (MV) Pamba to keep track of the revenue performance. In addition, the Accounting Officer is advised to engage the line Ministry and ensure that a revenue sharing agreement is established.\\n\\n**d)** Delayed Completion of the consultancy for the unit cost study for road construction and maintenance in Uganda**\\n\\nOn 30 th July 2019, the Ministry entered into a contract for a unit cost study for road construction and maintenance in Uganda at a contract price of UGX.2,102,966,500. The contract was to be executed in nine (9) months from the date of contract signing, implying that the contract completion date was supposed to be 30 th April, 2020.\\n\\nA review of the performance of the contract revealed the following: -\\n\\ni.  \\nAlthough the cumulative payments to the consultant totalled to UGX.1,472,076,550 (70% of the contract price) by end of September 2022, almost 2 & ½ years later, most aspects of the contract such as testing the cost management system, 2 nd stakeholders’ workshop, final report, cost estimation and monitoring systems and implementation strategy had not been delivered.\\n\\nii.  \\nAlthough, section 7.6 of Terms of Reference (TORs) for the study required six (6) staff from MoWT, UNRA, KCCA and Uganda Road Fund to be attached to the Consultant as counterpart staff for training and technology transfer, there was no evidence that it was done.\\n\\n---\\n\\nimportant to highlight that access to offices and documents was necessary for the majority of the Consultancy\\'s primary activities.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the Consultant to ensure that the report is delivered expeditiously to enhance decision making.\\n\\n**e)** Maintenance of district and zonal road equipment**\\n\\nI carried out inspection of the regional mechanical workshops and established that 23 Districts’ road equipment, especially Motor graders remained in the Workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair with some having been grounded since 2016.\\n\\nThis has affected the maintenance of roads in the affected districts.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Regional Workshops received only UGX.10,492,000,000 as operational funding against an actual requirement of UGX.45,000,000,000 thereby not able to carry out all the necessary repairs.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to lobby the responsible authorities and have the road equipment maintenance budget improved.\\n\\n**f)** Grounded Aircrafts at the East African civil Aviation Academy**\\n\\nThe inspection of the East African civil Aviation Academy (Soroti Flying School) indicated that all its nine (9) training aircrafts were grounded due to the expiry of their insurance or being faulty. I further noted that three aircrafts involved in accidents during the year under review had not been repaired due to the delayed compensation by the insurance service provider.\\n\\nThe training of pilots had been suspended resulting into un-necessary costs of keeping students on the campus without training and extension of the time within which students would complete their courses. In addition, salaries for the Instructors and staff are being paid without activities, which is wasteful.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the financial challenges have derailed the Academy from executing its mandate. It was further explained that the Academy procured an insurance service provider (Sanlam) at a cost of UGX.570,832,735, however after accepting the offer, the Academy received a late communication from Sanlam declining to offer the service. The issue has however been escalated to the Attorney General for further guidance on the next action against Sanlam Insurance. In addition, 5X-UAN 310 aircraft was manufactured in 1978 whose production line had been stopped, hence the Academy had to make special arrangements for the production of the parts required. It should also be noted that the aircraft was undergoing major structural repairs which required lots of parts.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFurther UNRA has a policy of approving certificates within 60 days by a committee appointed by the Accounting Officer, however, I noted that the approval process takes much longer and by the end of the year the un approved certificates had accumulated to **UGX.144.3Bn.**\\n\\nAccumulation of liabilities lead to interest payments related to non-settlement of certificates issued for work done leading to escalation of construction costs. Furthermore, it paints a bad picture on road contracts and some intrinsic costs may be built in the contract to cater for delays leading to high cost contracts. During the year an amount of **UGX.41.34Bn** was paid as interest for delayed payment for various projects.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the exercise for the verification and approval of works certificates is a very lengthy because of the technicalities and the amounts involved. Furthermore, the delayed release of funds also leads to late payments hence interest penalties.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MoFPED with a view of securing additional resources to settle the liabilities. I also advised the Accounting Officer to review the payment approval process and payment terms to mitigate the risk of interest charges due to penalties\\n\\n**12.0. HEALTH SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Management of Essential Medicines and Health Supplies in Health Facilities**\\n\\nSection 4 of the Essential Medicines and Health Supplies Manual 2012 requires an effective stock management system which ensures that the right medicines of the right quality and quantities are available at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost. Furthermore, Section 4 of the National Medical Stores Act 1993 provides that one of the objectives is to secure, safe and efficient storage, administration, distribution and supply of the goods, having regard to national needs and to the special nature of the goods in question in accordance with the national drug policy and the national drug authority.\\n\\nA review was undertaken of the supply, storage, administration and distribution of EMHS in National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities and I noted the following:\\n\\n- Most of the hospitals and facilities had expired drugs which were kept in the stores instead of being returned to NMS for appropriate handling. In addition, NMS had Non Viable Stock of UGX.13.4Bn at the close of the Financial year representing an increment of Ugx.8.25Bn (160%) from 2020/2021. The expired drugs included ARVs, donated latex gloves that failed NDA tests and items which could not be ordered for and utilised during the covid- 19 lockdown.\\n\\n- Most hospitals and specialized health facilities still experienced drug stock outs ranging from 9-360 days.\\n\\n- The storage areas for drugs in most of the hospitals and specialized facilities were small and medicines were congested with some medicines on the floors instead of pallets and boxes leaning on walls. Some stores were not well lit and appropriately ventilated.\\n\\n---\\n\\ntransporting and destroying them. Further, poor storage conditions for drugs may result into loss of potency or degradation of products that may harm patients.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with the responsible stakeholders such as NMS, Ministry of Health, NDA, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and Development Partners to improve the management of EMHS at National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities.\\n\\n**b )** Understaffing in Health Facilities**\\n\\nNational Regional Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities have staff structures that need to be adequately filled for efficient and effective service delivery. I however noted that the facilities had staffing gaps with the critical gaps being in the National Referral Hospitals that were recently elevated from Regional Referral status and specialized facilities (UCI and UHI) whose staff structures are yet to be approved by the Ministry of Public Service.\\n\\nI also noted that for most of the facilities, funds for recruitment of staff were warranted and released in the last quarter of the financial year (May 2022). As a result, there was not enough time for Health Service Commission to recruit staff so that the facilities can absorb the funds. Funds were thus returned to the UCF.\\n\\nInadequate staffing results in heavy workloads and exploitation of existing staff, creates job- related stress which negatively affects the quality-of-service delivery to the community.  \\nI advised Management to follow up the recruitment funding for re-voting and ensure completion of recruitment exercise.\\n\\n**c)** Utilization and Maintenance of Medical Equipment**\\n\\nAccording to Section 7 of Operation Manual for Regional Medical Equipment Maintenance Workshops and Medical Equipment Maintenance Guidelines, 2013, the entity should plan and budget for maintenance under two main categories of Planned Preventive Maintenance and Breakdown maintenance to ensure efficient maintenance of medical equipment.\\n\\nI made an assessment of medical equipment in the National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities focusing on the functionality and availability of medical equipment and maintenance of the same. The results of my assessment are summarized below;\\n\\n- The hospitals and specialized health facilities did not plan for preventive maintenance based on analyzed equipment data such as usage statistics and dates of previous maintenance. This led to persistent breakdown of equipment and prolonged down time which affected service delivery in terms of reliability and quality of health care.\\n\\n- There were budget shortfalls for maintenance of equipment with some hospitals and facilities receiving less than 50% of the budget. As a result, a number of vital equipment were not appropriately maintained during the year.\\n\\n- For Mulago National Referral Hospital I undertook a special audit which included among others the procurement and maintenance of medical equipment and noted various anomalies in the payments for maintenance of medical equipment. The details are included in separate audit report.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officers to improve medical equipment maintenance planning and liaise with the relevant stakeholders including Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to secure adequate funding for maintenance and replacement of medical equipment.\\n\\n**d) Unresolved Contingent Liabilities**\\n\\nI reviewed the financial statements of Ministry of Health and noted that there was a sum of UGX.120,829,578,815 in respect of potential obligations/payables due to various organisations as at 30 th June 2022. Refer to the table below for details:\\n\\n**Table 66: Unresolved Contingent Liabilities**  \\n**Contingent liabilities Details** Amount (UGX)** Legal proceedings i. Spencon Services Ltd  \\n45,656,660,072  \\nii. Family Care Hospital  \\n550,000,000 Other Contingent iii.

National Medical Stores – Storage and  \\n31,412,512,826 distribution of drugs  \\n**Total** 120,829,578,815**\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, settlement of the above potential obligations is likely to adversely affect future operations of the Ministry.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry constituted a team comprising NDA, the MOH Pharmacy department, and MOH Internal Audit to verify and reconcile the above figures. The exercise was still ongoing.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to fast track the reconciliation process. In addition, management should consider liaising with NMS and NDA to agree on a payment plan to settle the validated domestic arrears.\\n\\n**13.0. TRADE SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Payments outside the Work Plan**\\n\\nParagraph 10.33.1 (d) of the Treasury Instructions 2017 requires additional internal controls relating to payments to be noted by each Accounting Officer and that all commitments should be consistent with the approved annual budget, and relate to activities in the annual work plan.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer stated that these payments were made because the Ministry received additional funding to settle additional cooperatives via supplementary releases appropriated by Parliament for that purpose.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage Parliament and other stakeholders to streamline prioritization of cooperative compensations to ensure equitable allocation of resources and transparency.\\n\\n**b)** Payments to Cooperatives through Third parties - Law Firms**\\n\\nParagraph 10.6.1 of the Treasury Instructions 2017, states that in general, all Government payments processed through the Government Financial Management Information system (GFMIS) will be made by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to the beneficiary bank accounts. I reviewed the compensation process and payments made and noted the following:\\n\\n- During the financial year, War claims compensation of UGX. 29.09 Bn was made to different persons and law firms but not directly to the beneficiary Cooperative societies for onward remittance to beneficiary Cooperative members. It was observed that, Cooperative compensations are not driven by Cooperative members. As a result, the process and resolutions pertaining to valuation of the claimed amounts attached to the lost properties during the war are not known by members.\\n\\n- I noted that Cooperative Unions currently do not have constituted Boards, contrary to section 18A (1) of the Cooperative Societies Act 2020, that requires every society to have a Board consisting of an odd number of members not less than five and not exceeding nine.\\n\\n- Furthermore, files relating to fifty-five (55) Cooperative Societies were not availed for audit; hence I could not confirm the authenticity of the compensation claims. The verification reports for only fifteen (15) cooperative societies were seen but these also did not have their specific files, hence posing a risk of having non-existing Cooperatives being compensated.\\n\\n- Minutes to prove any agreement on the resolutions taken were not availed hence casting doubt on the authenticity of the transactions, member participation and physical existence of these Cooperatives leading to a risk that the bonafide beneficiaries may not have received the payment.\\n\\n- Only the verification committee members signed the compensation claims report.\\n\\n- Management paid excess amount of UGX .588.2 Mn above the planned (in regard to payments to Teso Cooperative Union - UGX.352.9Mn and North Bukedi Cooperative Union – UGX.235.2Mn). Similarly, UGX.6.17Bn that was earmarked to pay three Cooperative Unions; Masaba Cooperative Union (UGX.882.35 Mn), West Nile Growers Cooperative Union (UGX.882.35Mn) and Wamala Growers Cooperative Union (UGX.4.41Bn) but was not paid. Management attributed the overpayment to the availability of resources.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI further found the practice of payment through third parties both inconveniencing and exposing the Ministry to loss of public funds to non-bonafide members, given the lack of participation of members\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that Cooperatives’ legal representatives, instructed the Ministry formally to pay compensations through third parties, adding that some of the files had been transferred to Entebbe for temporally storage, hence could thus not be readily availed to auditors.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all Cooperative Unions are legally constituted, their existence verified and review the practice of making payments through third parties and pay directly to Cooperatives. Meanwhile, a follow up process to confirm that the payments reached the beneficiary Cooperatives should be initiated and the overpayments recovered.\\n\\n**c)** Under absorption of funds in Uganda Development Corporation (UDC)**\\n\\nSection 45 (3) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 states that an Accounting Officer shall enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a Financial year, submitted under Section 13 (15)” of the said Act. UDC receives appropriation through Vote 015.\\n\\nIt was established that overall, in addition to the unspent funds from the prior year of UGX.80.4 Bn, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48 as summarized below;\\n\\n**Table 67: Under absorption of funds in UDC** Item Funds Funding Total Amount Variance brought received funds spent – UGX Bn** **forward during the available (UGX Bn)**  \\n**(UGX Bn) year (UGX**  \\n**Bn)**  \\nWage and 3.8 12.87 16.67 8.7 7.97 non-wage  \\nDevelopment/ 76.6 150.35 226.95 24.44 202.5 projects  \\n**Total 80.4 163.22 243.62 33.142 210.48**\\n\\n---\\n\\nin relation to the other projects was due to the investment process that is followed to ensure viability and sustainability and has operated without a Board for the greater part of the year.\\n\\nI advised the Executive Director to devise strategies for expediting the implementation of the projects to improve funds absorption.\\n\\n**d)** Failure to seek approval for unspent balances**\\n\\nSection 17 (1) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015 states that “Every appropriation by Parliament shall expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made.” Sub Section (2) of the same section further requires the unspent money that was appropriated for the financial year, to be repaid to the Consolidated Fund at the close of the financial year.\\n\\nSubsection (3) of the same section further states that a vote that repays money under subsection (2) shall revise its annual work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to take into account the unexpended money and the Minister responsible for the vote shall submit, as part of the budget for the preceding year, the revised work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to the Minister.\\n\\nUganda Development Corporation receives project funds that are appropriated under the Ministry of Trade Industry and Cooperatives. The funding caters for operations (wage and Non-wage) and specific projects. However, UDC has accumulated project funds of UGX. 80.4Bn since 30th June 2021. The funds in issue were not returned to the consolidated fund and neither was supplementary funding approval sought. This may be attributed to the accounting policies of the Corporation where all Government funds are capitalised.\\n\\nRetention of un-spent balances without authority contravenes the PFMA and May lead to the diversion of funds resulting from accounting policies adopted.\\n\\nThe Executive Director explained that UDC was being funded in accordance with the UDC Act 2016 and that according to Section 24 of the Act, the Board is required to declare to the Minister any money of the Corporation that is not utilised at the end of each financial year and also allows the Corporation to invest any funds not immediately required for any purpose upon approval of the Board.\\n\\nI advised the Executive Director to always ensure compliance with the PFMA regarding budget execution and seek appropriate authority to retain the funds. In addition, Management is advised to engage all stakeholders to change the funding model to allow all funds appropriated and remitted to the Corporation to be capitalised.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**14.0. TOURISM SECTOR**\\n\\n**a)** Lack of a comprehensive plan for the management of the invasive species**\\n\\nAccording to Section 21(1-2) of the Uganda Wildlife Act 2019, The Board shall develop a conservation planning manual that takes cognizance of the national policies and development planning frameworks and the Executive Director shall, with the approval of the Board prepare and publish a comprehensive management plan for each wildlife protected area and wildlife management area, in accordance with the conservation planning manual.\\n\\nDuring my review of the plans for the Authority, I was not availed with a conservation planning manual and a comprehensive management plan for each wildlife protected area and wildlife management area and I was unable to confirm whether there is a deliberate effort to manage the invasive and exotic plant species that cover an average of 30% of the surface areas of Queen Elizabeth, Lake Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks.\\n\\nThese invasive/exotic or endemic plants, amongst others, include different species such as Dichrostachys cinerea, Lantana Camara, Parthenium hysterophorus, Opuntia Vulgaris, Imperata cylindrica, Maeruade cumbens, Caesalepina decaputala, Acacia hockii, Tecoma Stan, Senna siamea and Thevetia peruviana.\\n\\nI attributed this to the delayed decision by the Board and Management of UWA to determine the approach that can comprehensively deal with the invasive species.\\n\\nThe invasive species contract the grazing areas for herbivores animals and affect the rangeland and environmental quality that consequently reduce the wildlife population of grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda Kobs.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer acknowledged the issue and informed me in his response that invasive plant management is a real challenge in the management of protected areas and that this needed more funds than UWA could allocate. He further explained that management had annually allocated funds for the eradication of the invasive species and so far 2000 hectares had been freed and are being maintained. He added in his response that a total of UGX.770Mn had been allocated to invasive management under UWA internally generated funds and another UGX.1.590Bn under World Bank (IFPA-CD project).\\n\\nAdditionally, he further explained that the funds allocated to the management of invasive included engaging a consultant to spearhead the development of the Invasive Species Management Strategy to be concluded before the close of this financial year 2022-2023 and the procurement of a consultant to develop a strategy for eradication of invasive species is at advertising stage.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhereas all the ten (10) national parks were dually gazetted in accordance with the law, I noted that there were several ongoing cases of claims on land in the gazetted areas under the management of Uganda Wildlife Authority as evidenced by active court cases in some parks namely Lake Mburo National Park, Mt. Elgon National Park, Semiliki National Park and Matheniko Bokora. This was attributed to increased encroachment on the National parkland.\\n\\nFailure to resolve these cases may lead to the loss of gazetted land areas that will affect wildlife conservation.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained in his response that prior to the creation of Uganda National Parks and later Uganda Wildlife Authority; the protected areas mentioned above were being managed under the Forest and Game Departments of Government. These two Departments were ill-facilitated by Government and therefore had no funds to enforce the protection of the said areas and this resulted in a number of encroachments. When UWA took over management, a number of efforts have been made to resolve these conflicts, most of which are in court. UWA has no jurisdiction over the Courts of Law and is therefore incapacitated to have the court cases fast-tracked.\\n\\nHe further explained that the Authority engaged the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities and the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development which led to the cancellation of some of the erroneously issued titles; the process of cancellation of others is still ongoing. Additionally, the Accounting Officer informed that the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities is already engaging the Ministry of Lands on the matter.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to closely monitor illegal encroachments in the gazetted areas and take appropriate actions to resolve these claims.\\n\\n15. **CROSS CUTTING ISSUES IN SCHOOLS**\\n\\nI undertook financial audit of Secondary schools and Tertiary Institutions for the financial year ending 30 th December 2020 and 30 th June 2020 respectively and observed the following key findings that are also included in individual entity reports.\\n\\ni. A review of Approved budget estimates of 207 schools revealed that they budgeted to receive UGX.390,261,047,176 but only realised UGX.209,516,751,825 leading to an underfunding of UGX.180,744,295,351 (46%). Failure to realise all budgeted amounts affected implementation of several school activities.\\n\\nii. 16 schools did not prepare financial statements for the year under review. Failure to prepare financial statements hinders effective oversight over expenditure, revenue, assets and liabilities of the school.  \\niii. Receivables of UGX.21,094,320,460 had accumulated in 117 schools by the end of the financial year. Receivables represent an idle asset, since it denied schools the revenue required to implement planned activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\nvii. 55 schools did not have strategic plans to guide them in planning for achievement of short term, medium term and long-term goals. Non-existence of the school strategic plan affects effective planning and budgeting in the short term and long term.\\n\\nviii. 49 schools did not have procurement plans to guide the procurement processes executed during the year. Lack of a procurement plan could result into diversion of funds to non- critical procurements not initially intended to be executed.\\n\\n**B.** CROSS CUTTING ISSUES IN LLGs**\\n\\nI sampled 335 LLGs for audit in the financial year of 2020/2021. I reviewed the funding for the year and noted that the LLGs had budgeted to receive UGX.138,533,294,237, but only received UGX.112,296,656,986 (81%) which led to a shortfall of UGX.26,236,637,251 (19%).\\n\\nA review of the implementation of the planned activities in the LLGs revealed the following;\\n\\ni.  \\n325 of the audited LLGs had unqualified opinions, 8 of them had qualified opinions and 2 were issued with disclaimers.\\n\\nii. They budgeted to collect local revenue of UGX.41,936,664,586, but only collected UGX.29,999,490,158 (71.5%) which resulted into a shortfall of UGX.11,937,174,428 (28.5%). Shortfalls in local revenue collections negatively affect the implementation of planned activities which frustrates service delivery.\\n\\niii. Only 2,928 posts were filled out of 7792 approved staff posts. Understaffing overstretches the available staff beyond their capacity, creates job-related stress to the fewer staff and negatively affects the level of public service delivery to the community.\\n\\niv. I noted that 140 LLGs lacked title deeds for 632 plots of land. This implies that the land is exposed to a risk of encroachment and land disputes.\\n\\nv. Out of the 335 LLGs sampled, only 28 had strategic plans in place and the remaining 307 did not have. There is a risk that the budgets prepared and activities implemented during the financial year were not aligned to the NDP- III which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLower Local Councils in the implementation of Government programs which affects service delivery at the grass roots.\\n\\nx. 6 LLGs failed to account for UGX.459,463,633 in the FY 2020/2021 and therefore I was unable to confirm that the funds were used for the intended purpose.\\n\\nxi. 16 LLGs spent UGX.200,229,143 in excess of the required amount on council allowances. There is a risk that funds meant for implementation of planned activities was diverted and used to pay Council emoluments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**PART 4: INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, VALUE FOR MONEY AND SPECIAL AUDITS**\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2020/2021, I undertook three Information Systems audits, three Engineering audits covering 90 projects, eight Value for money audits. In addition, I undertook special and forensic audits which are reported on separately.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of the key findings I noted in each category, the details of which are included in individual reports issued separately.\\n\\n**4.1.** KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ENGINEERING AUDITS**\\n\\n**4.1.1. Audit of GRID Extension Projects implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency Currently under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for the period 2009 – 2017**\\n\\nBetween 2009 and 2017, REA secured over **USD.80Million** from SIDA, JICA, World Bank, NORAD and the Government of Uganda to implement priority Rural Electrification Projects most of which were part of the sample of projects under review.\\n\\nThe Scope of the audit covered the GRID extension power line projects implemented in the 13 service territories under the various funding programs between the financial years 2013/14 to 2017/18.\\n\\nThe scope of the GRID Extension power-line projects assessment was the following;\\n\\ni.  \\nCompleted Grid Projects Implemented by REA since Financial Year 2013/2014 to 2016/17 when RESP II was being implemented\\n\\nii.  \\nCompleted UMEME Cost Shared Lines since 2013/2014 and 2014/15.\\n\\niii.  \\nSchemes Implemented through Concession Operators\\n\\n- Kilembe Mines Ltd\\n- Ferdsult Engineering Servcies Ltd \\uf0b7\\n\\nWenrenco \\uf0b7\\n\\nUEDCL  \\niv.  \\nOngoing Grid Projects under Implementation by REA\\n\\n---\\n\\nUrbanization of several trading centres has taken place along the power lines constructed, many income-generating activities were initiated by the locals such as maize milling, wielding, salons, juice production thus improving their incomes and way of life and creation of employment opportunities; promoting value addition to the local agricultural products and dairy products; reduction in greenhouse emissions; improving investment climate in targeted communities; and increase in government revenue.\\n\\nHowever, there are still some performance gaps in operation of rural electrification projects that need to be addressed as follows;\\n\\ni.  \\nAudit carried out creditor circularization to determine any outstanding amounts owed to Contractors, Consultants and Concessioners and noted that, REA owed nine (9) firms for works already completed worth **USD.28,080,776.53** and **UGX.3,350,908,860.**\\n\\nii.  \\nOut of the commissioned lines, UMEME attracted and obtained O&M rights for about 25% and these were largely township lines. UEDCL obtained about 60% of the O&M rights leaving the 15% to the other operators, however audit did not get evidence of any deliberate O&M policies or practices largely on the preventative maintenance. The auditors were not provided with preventative maintenance plans, nor was there proof of a structured and consistence implementation of basic prudent maintenance practices on the lines. Although ERA is mandated to issue license to the operators, review and approve the O&M Budgets as well as regulate the operations of these licensee, audit noted minimal supervision by ERA in line with oversight monitoring and Evaluation.\\n\\niii.  \\nAdditionally, in terms of the operating and management costs of power lines, they were deemed high due to a number of factors such as transformers, defective or rotten poles which needed replacement in the shortest of time after the commissioning of these lines. For instance, according to UEDCL data for Kabale – Kisoro – Bunagana Scheme, the annual maintenance cost was at UGX.34.7 **billion** against UGX.518 **billion** generated revenues. This translates 6.8% of revenue which is above the 5% threshold requirement.\\n\\niv.  \\nThere are several occupation and safety hazards noted during implementation of the GRID power projects. 33kV power lines were constructed to span across roofs of residential houses in Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere power scheme, Mpanga- Kamwenge-Kahungye-Nkingo.\\n\\n---\\n\\ndecrease in the safety and performance of the network as well as reduced expected lifetime of the equipment.\\n\\nvii.  \\nIn line with contractual requirements, wooden poles are expected to last up to 20years. Document review and field inspections noted that poles supplied on some projects as; Masindi- Waki-Buliisa, Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere, Gulu-Acholibur, Kitgum-Palabek, Ayer-Kamdini among others, failed due to rotting, insect Infestation, pole burning and breaking. No document was availed to ascertain that quality control procedures were followed. Furthermore, no effort was recognized from REA that the defective wooden poles are claimed back from the respective pole suppliers.\\n\\nI have made the following recommendations to the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) which has now inherited the functions of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under which the GRID power projects were implemented and recommended that;\\n\\na.  \\nThe outstanding amounts owed to contractor’s firms are paid for works that are completed and verified to avoid incurring penalties on delayed payments.\\n\\nb.  \\nTo continuously address Environmental and social issues in contracts and their implementation and ensure that all contracts for implementation of GRID power projects make it mandatory for the implementation firms to prepare environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) reports in addition to resultant Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement Action Management Plans (RAMPs).\\n\\nc.  \\nExpedite the process of compensating all PAPs taking into consideration the time lag for the delayed payment (9 years since existing assessment was conducted) accordingly, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) studies should be conducted based on the final designs, where changes are deemed inevitable in the optimal design, such changes should be communicated such that revaluations of new PAPs are conducted.\\n\\nd.  \\nEstablish causes of failing wooden poles even after quality tests have been undertaken. The option to use Concrete Poles can also be considered especially given that the quality control during manufacture for concrete poles can easily be monitored and controlled unlike wooden poles whose quality is determined by many factors from the time they are planted, harvested, treated at the factory, and eventually transported to site.\\n\\n- The licensed firms operating under concession agreements undertake effective operation and maintenance activities in respect of replacing all\\n\\n---\\n\\nnon-function GRID equipment as blown fuses, surge arrestors, replacing broken poles, faulty transformers to keep the power lines functional\\n\\n- MEMD closely monitors and supervises the licensees to establish that they comply with the license terms and conditions and fulfil the objective of increasing access to electricity.\\n\\n**A) Technical Engineering Audit of 39 Selected UNRA Road Development and Rehabilitation Projects implemented during financial year 2021/2022**\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2021/22, a total of 39 projects (Development, rehabilitation and bridge projects) with a total contract sum/value of **UGX.8.49Tn** were under implementation by UNRA. A sample of nine (9) projects (development and rehabilitation projects) with a contract sum/value of **UGX. 1.86Tn** (21.87%) were selected for audit and the following observations made;\\n\\n**i. Delayed provision of access to project sites resulting in a Loss of UGX.5.64Bn**\\n\\nA loss of **UGX. 5.64Bn** was incurred as a result of failure to access land for road project sites in 6 road projects, this arose from delayed compensation of Project affected Persons (PAPs) for acquisition of land for right of way resulting in the contractors charging UNRA for time related obligations due to failure to access project site and charging UNRA for idle time.\\n\\nIn 6 of the 9 UNRA road projects, access to sites was not achieved as required by the different contract arrangements. This was the case especially where the contracts required the employer to handover a minimum of 30% of the land required for permanent works within 3 months of the commencement and the balance within 12 months. There was no timely access to sites, which resulted in multiple extensions of time and in some instances costs relating to the time obligations. The delays were noted on the following projects;\\n\\na.  \\nTirinyi –Pallisa-Kumi where delays led to payment of **UGX. 4.56Bn** for time related obligations  \\nb.  \\nPallisa - Kamonkoli where access delays led to payment of **UGX. 1.08Bn** for time related obligations  \\nc.  \\nFor Kapchorwa - Suam project where the access to site delayed from 21 days to 441 days from Km 42 to Km 73.  \\nd.  \\nRukungiri-Kihihi/Ishasha where a delay of 70 days was initially experienced and later increased due to non-compensation of project affected persons.  \\ne.  \\nKampala Northern By-pass where access was achieved 5 years into implementation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 68: Projects with delays in design review** **Sn Project**  \\n**1** Kapchorwa-Suam project  \\n**2** Kigumba-Bulima  \\n**3** Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu  \\n**4** Kampala Northern Bypass\\n\\n**No. of months delayed** 31 months  \\n24 months  \\n16 months.  \\n6 months\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the consultant submits required deliverables within contractual timelines. The UNRA project management team should be held responsible for delays without appropriate justification.\\n\\n**iii. Interest charges of UGX.1.82Bn on delayed payment of Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs) to the Contractors**\\n\\nI established that payments of interim payment certificates to the contractors for eight projects were not on time. Delays in payments of IPCs may lead to interest payments and affect the contractor’s cash flows in project execution. The following delays were noted on projects and determination of certificates;\\n\\na.  \\nFor Kapchorwa - Suam project, delays on all IPCs up to IPC No. 7 resulting in an interest payment of **UGX.1.08Bn.**  \\nb.  \\nFor Tirinyi – Pallisa - Kumi, IPCs 1 to 6 were delayed resulting in a certified interest of **UGX.0.45Bn.**  \\nc.  \\nPallisa - Kamonkoli, delays were observed on IPCs 1 to 7 resulting in a certified interest of **UGX.0.28Bn.**  \\nd.  \\nMpigi town roads, all payments to the contractor were delayed between 28 and 242 days  \\ne.  \\nNamunsi – Sironko – Muyembe - Kapchorwa (Phase II), delays on IPCs 5 to 9 ranging from 4 days and over 7 months.  \\nf.  \\nKitala - Gerenge project, delays in payments to suppliers in June 2021  \\ng.  \\nRukungiri – Kihihi - Ishasha/Kanungu, delays in payments on IPCs 1-15 ranging from 8 to 142 days.  \\nh.  \\nFor Kampala Northern Bypass, payments were delayed and interest paid in Addendum No.3 for all payments up to June 2020.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer attributed delays to reductions in MTEF allocations resulting in funding shortages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 69: Project overpayments**  \\n**S/No Contract/Project name** Overpayment (UGX) 1** Kapchorwa-Suam 20,594,809.19 **2** Tirinyi-Pallisa-Kumi 0 **3** Pallisa-Kamonkoli 0 **4** Mpigi Town Roads (20km  \\n126,896,449.94  \\n**5** Kigumba-Bulima 49,129,125 **6** Namunsi – Sironko – Muyembe Kasalem  \\n6,168,276 (PHASE II)  \\n**7** Kitala-Gerenge (in-house construction)  \\n0  \\n**8** Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu 29,081,818 **TOTAL (UGX) 231,870,478.13 9** Kampala Northern Bypass II (Capacity EUR **47,469.01** Improvement)\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to recover all the overpayments and institute measures to prevent overpayments.\\n\\n**v.** Unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor**\\n\\nI observed unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor which can lead to overpayments if unaddressed. This was established on the following projects;\\n\\na.  \\nKapchorwa - Suam project where the foreign currency exchange rates were being applied without justification which might lead to computation errors in price adjustment certificates.  \\nb.\\n\\nTirinyi – Pallisa - Kumi where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX 3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX 3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of **UGX.54.84Mn.**  \\nc.\\n\\nPallisa - Kamonkoli where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX 3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX 3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of **UGX.40.05Mn.**\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure payments are made as per contract terms and the right rates are adopted for payments to prevent any financial loss.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**vii. Irregular advancement of UGX.2.32Bn to the Contractor relating to materials on site**\\n\\n**UGX.2.32Bn** was advanced to the contractor in payment certificates (01 to 07) relating to materials on site for the Mpigi town roads project without any contractual basis.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer responded that the materials-on-site value was paid in split currency as per the main road contract.  \\nI indicated to the Accounting Officer that the contract signed for the works in 2019 did not have any provision for payments of materials-on-site. The main contract being referenced did not form any part of the contract documents as listed in the contract agreement.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the funds are recovered from the subsequent payments.\\n\\n**B) Value for Money Technical/Engineering Audit of Twenty Infrastructure Projects Implemented by Ministry Of Education And Sports Under The Uganda Skills Development Program (USDP)**\\n\\nThe Uganda Skills Development Project (USDP) is a five-year World Bank funded project with a development objective of enhancing the capacity of institutions to deliver high quality demand-driven training courses in three priority sectors (agriculture, construction and manufacturing). In line with the objectives of the project, the Ministry of Education is undertaking building infrastructural works in twenty (20) technical institutes.\\n\\nDuring the financial year 2021/22, I under took a Value for Money Technical- Engineering audit of Twenty (20) infrastructure projects of the Uganda Skills Development Programme (USDP) worth **UGX. 108.47Bn** implemented by Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES).\\n\\n**i.**\\n\\n**Procurement of the USDP Infrastructure Projects**\\n\\nI reviewed procurement documentation for the 20 USDP Projects and noted the following;\\n\\n---\\n\\nd.  \\nThe contracts for the works contractors in Kalango and Ora, and Kitgum Technical Institutes, were awarded to the second and the fifth best evaluated bidders respectively without justification.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer of MoES to ensure strict compliance with PPDA rules and regulations and World Bank Guidelines on procurement of World Bank funded projects.\\n\\n**ii. Design Omissions**\\n\\nI reviewed the design reports and drawings of eighteen (18) contracts that were prepared by the design consultant and noted a number of omissions some of which were later on introduced as variations during implementation of the construction works.\\n\\nThe omissions included; anti-sag rods and wind bracing members in the steel roof trusses, considerations for rain water harvesting options, retaining walls, generator houses, tank drawings, internal floor drains and storm water designs.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that designs prepared by consultants are thoroughly reviewed to ensure that they adequately consider all aspects required.\\n\\n**iii.**\\n\\n**Delayed Completion of Works**\\n\\nI noted delays in completion of the works on ten (10) contracts ranging from 15 to 330 days. Resulting from these delays were liquidated damages totalling **UGX.3.77Bn** that were not charged from the contractors as per contract terms. The table below refers;\\n\\n**Table 70: Unclaimed liquidated damages** S/No Contract Delays Uncharged (days) Liquidated Damages**\\n\\n**1** Bukalasa Agricultural College Lot 1\\n\\n**(UGX)**  \\n90 748,388,026 **2** Kaberamaido Technical Institute 110 540,383,514 **3** Kalongo Technical Institute  \\n**4** Ora Technical Institute  \\n**5** Kitgum Technical Institute  \\n**6** UTC Bushenyi Lot 1  \\n**7** UTC Bushenyi Lot 2\\n\\n15 41,378,333 44 104,234,819 100 293,682,207 76 746,294,824 330 762,408,141 **8** Nyamitanga Technical Institute 226 228,585,432 **9** Karera Technical Institute  \\n**10** Lake Katwe Technical Institute  \\n**TOTAL**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 71: Unrecovered advances from expired guarantees**  \\n**SN Contract** Unrecovered Advance at Expiry of**\\n\\n**1** Ssesse Farm Institute  \\n**2** UTC Lira Lot 2  \\n**3** Kalongo Technical Institute  \\n**4** Ora Technical Institute  \\n**5** Kitgum Technical Institute  \\n**6** UTC Bushenyi Lot 2  \\n**7** Nyamitanga Technical Institute **8** Butalejja Technical Institute **TOTAL**\\n\\n**Guarantee (UGX)** 509,617,393 43,061,091 387,890,177 254,620,642 440,639,594 1,938,309,766 581,149,404 394,579,955 **4,549,868,022**\\n\\nNon-renewal of the guarantees may lead to failure to recover the advances paid in the event the contractors fail to complete execution of the construction works.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage contractors and secure additional advance guarantees and recover the advances otherwise, the advances should be fully recovered on the subsequent payments.\\n\\n**v. Irregular Payments**\\n\\nI noted that various payments across the 20 contracts were irregular due to the absence of documents supporting these payments, duplicate payments and payments for unexecuted works totaling **UGX. 1.95Bn.**\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to conduct further review of these payments and take appropriate action.\\n\\n**vi. Quantity Verifications**\\n\\nI undertook an analysis of the drawings in the contract documents availed and also undertook measurements on some of the executed work items to establish the consistency with which the supervision team accurately measured the quantities before payments. I noted inconsistencies in some of the quantities certified across all the 20 contracts resulting in overpayments equivalent to **UGX.1.71Bn** from the different projects as shown in the table below;\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **S/No Contract** Overpayment (UGX)** |<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 15 | UTC Elgon Lot 1 | 23,112,847 |  \\n| 16 UTC Elgon Lot 2  21,469,465 |<|<|  \\n| 17 | Kaliro Technical Institute | 8,114,020 |  \\n| 18 Butalejja Technical Institute  70,875,186 |<|<|  \\n| 19 | Kasodo Technical Institute | 125,683,060 |  \\n| 20 Rwentanga Technical Institute  33,199,300 |<|<|  \\n| TOTAL |<| **1,709,528,745** |  \\n\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to undertake further re-measurement of all the works and ensure recovery of the overpaid amounts before preparation of Final Accounts and closure of the aforementioned projects.\\n\\n**vii.**\\n\\n**Supervision of the Works**\\n\\nI noted that the Ministry did not use supervision firms procured and opted to supervise all the twenty (20) sites in-house. Whereas the supervising firm was expected to have four (4) Senior Civil Engineers/Architects, 4 Architects, 4 Quantity Surveyors, 4 Environmentalists and 4 Structural Engineers for all the 20 sites, I noted that at the time of audit, the Ministry only had 2 Senior Civil Engineers, 1 architect, 1 Quantity Surveyor, 1 Environmentalist and 1 structural Engineer for all the 20 sites.\\n\\nHowever, the supervisions were undertaken by the ministry yet they had limited capacity to undertake effective supervision.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that future projects are adequately supervised with appropriate specialist.\\n\\n**4.2.** REDACTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS AUDIT REPORTS**\\n\\nIn accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act (NAA) 2008, I am mandated to audit all the government investments and carry out special audit engagements that include information technology (IT) Audits. Accordingly, I planned and executed my audits following ISSAI 200: Fundamental Principles of Public-Sector Auditing and INTOSAI 5100 guidance.\\n\\nI conducted four (4) audits namely; National Security Information System (NSIS) at NIRA; Programme Budgeting System (PBS) at MOFPED, and Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) at (MoWT). Below are redacted versions of my key findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe system provides centralized approval and citizenship verification to the point of secure personalization and issuance of biometric and machine-readable National Identification Documents. The major functionality of the NSIS is to reliably identify Ugandan citizens and alien residents.\\n\\nI undertook an information systems audit of NSIS to establish whether the necessary general, application and specific controls were implemented and consistently applied. Below are the redacted findings which exclude sensitive application and database control weaknesses;\\n\\n**i.** Absence of active interfaces between NSIS and other systems**\\n\\nThe NSIS did not have active interfaces with other Government key systems such as URA’s E-Tax systems that process data relating to Government Non-Tax Revenue (NTR) generated from services offered by NIRA, IFMS and IPPS/HCMS which process Government critical information related to civil servants and other Government suppliers, including the banking sector.\\n\\nFurthermore, the sharing of information among NIRA internal systems was not automated. For example, in registering childbirth for the birth certificate, the registration officer re-keys the child and parent’s information into the BDAR system yet the same information is resident in NSIS.\\n\\nLack of proper interfaces with the other critical systems hinders Government effectiveness and efficiency in providing services and may lead to multiple inconsistent information in different systems and delayed delivery of services since procedures are repetitive.\\n\\nManagement explained that interfaces were not done because the system (NSIS) was vendor locked.\\n\\nNIRA should engage NITA-U and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MoICT) to ensure that all other MDAs and the private sector which rely on its information design strategies to enable interfaces or appropriate integrations with requisite protocols to mitigate misuse of data.\\n\\n- The integration with the various systems was not implemented.\\n- The Intellectual Property Rights (SCC 15) were not mentioned in the contract documents, creating challenges in the transfer of the system ownership, or transfer of source code.\\n- Generally, there were delays in the contract implementation as per the project implementation reports, as result, contract deliverables worth EUROS 421,934.80 were NOT implemented as summarized in the table below;\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 73: Status of implementation**  \\n**SN Item Description** Item Total Per cent Outstanding cost delivery (%) (EUROS) 1** Software installation and 1,262,748 90 126,275 Integration  \\n**2** Technical Project 1,510,000 90 151,000 management  \\n**3** Training and capacity building 343,100 90 34,310 **4** MCES programmer training 10,350 0 10,350 **5** Video Surveillance system 100,000 0 100,000 **Total**  \\n421,935 **Source:**  \\nManagement\\n\\nstatus report as of 22 nd June 2020\\n\\nI further noted that the implementation contract had expired in 2012. Subsequently, a Support and Maintenance contract was signed had also been terminated and the vendor had left the site by the time of the audit.\\n\\nThis may be attributed to the lack of a contract manager/management team as required by Section 52 (1) of the PPDA (contracts) Regulations 2014.\\n\\nManagement explained that the contract was signed between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Muehlbauer ID services GmbH in 2010, but implemented in 2014 following the Cabinet approval of the project team consisting of a policy committee comprising of Ministers chaired by the Prime Minister, a Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Internal Affairs/Projector Coordinator, and Project Implementation Team chaired by a Project Manager.\\n\\nThe system was built and was able to deliver the objectives of the project i.e., registration of citizens (16+ years) and achieved over 90% of the targets. This led to the enactment of ROPA 2015 and the establishment of NIRA to consolidate the achievements of the project.\\n\\nSubsequently, with the establishment of NIRA, all contracts were assigned, Contract Managers.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always streamline the management of the projects, by timely appointing the contract management team in accordance with PPDA regulations and industry best practices to facilitate effective project management. In addition, the Accounting Officer should explore ways of recovering costs relating to unimplemented deliverables.\\n\\n- There was no alignment of key ICT business functions/units in the authority. For instance, the birth and death systems were not integrated with the registration systems, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiency in the utilisation of data.\\n\\n- A number of IT policies were still in draft form for about three years due to the lack of an IT steering committee.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe above was attributed to a lack of appropriate IT governance structures in the Authority.\\n\\nManagement indicated that it had concluded policy drafting, awaiting Board approval and shall make sure they are in place before the end of FY 2022/23. The IT steering/strategy committee shall as well be constituted by the end of the first quarter of FY 2022/23.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage all stakeholders and institute appropriate Governance structures to foster the management of IT to effectively deliver its mandate.\\n\\n**iv.** Absence of IT governance policies and strategy**\\n\\nNIRA did not have IT governance policies and guides such as;\\n\\n- IT Strategic Plan\\n- IT risk assessment/management policy\\n- IT security policy\\n\\nAs a result, IT planning is performed on a reactionary ad-hoc basis and no IT Risk Assessment is carried out. Furthermore, the NIRA Board had not approved a security policy.\\n\\nGiven the dynamic nature of the IT environment, risks emerge continuously, and some may culminate into disastrous outcomes if left unchecked.\\n\\nManagement explained that NIRA IT-related policies were awaiting Board approval and shall ensure all are in place by the end of FY 2022/23.\\n\\nI advised Management to fast-track the approval of the policies and strategy, as well as institute mechanisms to timely update and implement them.\\n\\n**v.** IT continuity plans/disaster recovery plan**\\n\\nNIRA undertakes regular backup of data on backup tapes but comprehensive testing of the procedures for backed-up data recovery had not been conducted to establish the effectiveness of data recovery. In addition, the Authority did not have a Disaster Recovery Plan in place as required by industry practice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**vi.** Overlapping/conflicting roles on NIRA systems**\\n\\nA review of the system user roles and responsibilities revealed that some system users at NIRA hold conflicting roles. I noted one user having responsibilities for Application and Database Administration. In addition, Assistant Registration Officers at districts were performing IT Officer roles on the system.\\n\\nThere is a high likelihood of data fraud and theft without being detected by Management, arising out of misuse of conflicting/overlapping user responsibilities. Management explained that due to insufficient staffing numbers, officers were doing more roles and activities. Structure changes can only be expected after the Ministry of Public Service RAPEX exercise.\\n\\nI advised Management to ensure that the roles of users are adequately segregated and documented to ensure that no single user starts and completes a transaction on their own.\\n\\n**vii.** Lack of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between NIRA and various system vendors**\\n\\nThere were no SLAs between NIRA with the various providers of the critical systems used within the organization such as; the National Security and Identification System (NSIS), the Mobile Vital Records System (MVRS) and the Birth Death Adoption and Registration system (BDAR) system.\\n\\nWithout the SLAs, it is hard to measure and verify vendor performance in providing services, such as; service availability, defect rates, technical quality, security and business results, among others. In addition, it should specify the remedies in case of non-compliance with service-level standards.\\n\\nManagement explained that at the time of the Audit, NIRA did not have SLAs in place but had since entered into contracts for software support and maintenance for the NSIS and MVRS systems.\\n\\nI advised Management to negotiate and monitor SLAs with the respective vendors to ensure reliability and uninterrupted service delivery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**a) Lack of a strategy for transition from M/S Muehlbauer ID Services Gmbh NSIS to the USPC NSIS**\\n\\nThere was no formal strategy or transition plans from Muehlbauer ID Services GmbH to Uganda Security Printing Company in particular regard to; scope, migration design, data migration (process flow data and processed and stored data, biometric data) testing design, recruitment of new staff, organizational support, assessment of existing equipment/technologies and compatibility.\\n\\nManagement explained that a transition strategy including a data migration plan was being finalized with USPC.\\n\\n**b) Departure from the provisions of the Joint venture Agreement**\\n\\nI reviewed the Joint Venture Agreement between Uganda Printing & Publishing Corporation, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Office of the President and the consortium of Veridos GmbH and Giesecke & Devrient GmbH stipulates the obligations of the Uganda Security Printing Company that includes:\\n\\n- The establishment of modern paper-based security printing and card production lines,\\n\\n- Demolishing and constructing new buildings at Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation (UPPC) suitable to house machinery for printing and support quality security printing works,\\n\\n- Installation of modern machines/equipment to run and manage high-quality security print services for the documents that were previously printed by UUPPC and other security documents as shall be agreed,\\n\\n- Ensure that consumables needed for the manufacture are available at the best prices,\\n\\n- Establishment of an efficient and appropriate IT infrastructure and equipment that can enable effective delivery and usage of security documents in Uganda.\\n\\n- Supporting systems, the e-passport system, including IT systems and equipment that can enable effective and efficient delivery and application of security documents in the country. This also includes service and maintenance of the systems.\\n\\n- Ensure compatibility of technologies\\n- The consortium shall ensure that technologies supplied to the company are capable of integration with other third-party systems and in every way support the delivery of services or products under this agreement.\\n\\n- In case technologies are incapable of integration, the parties shall provide the necessary means of acquiring data /information from existing systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe National Security Information system is made up of two major interfacing systems;\\n\\n\\uf0d8 SDMS (Secure Document Management System)-\\n\\nThis system is responsible for enrolment and registration and contains manages the database and the life cycle of all applicants and monitors any changes, additions and death of a citizen. SDMS has four sub-modules;\\n\\n- **GET ID** -This is the enrolment solution responsible for enrolment, card issuance, replacement and change of particulars\\n- **DEOS (District Enrolment Offline/Online system)-this** system/module of the NSIS has two instances;\\n- **DEOS** Site-This aggregates different kits attached to a particular district/station\\n- **DEOS Central-this** aggregates data from different stations/districts on the central server\\n- **FRS** (Fingerprint recognition system)\\n- **AFIS** (automatic Face Recognition system)\\n\\n\\uf0d8 INCAPE (Integrated Card Personalization)\\n\\nThis is the system/software responsible for the printing and production of the national identity cards\\n\\nContrary to the provisions of the Joint Venture, USPC has been expanded to include;\\n\\n- Supply both the enrolment registration system to replace the Secure Document Management system (SDMS) that is responsible for enrolment, Registration, Fingerprint capture, Face recognition and card issuance.\\n\\n- The system responsible for national identity card production -INCAPE, rather than the supply of only the system that supports printing and production of National identity cards (INCAPE) as provided for in the Joint Venture.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Clause 18.1 states that the territory of the company is the national territory of Uganda unless otherwise mutually agreed by shareholders. The company shall have exclusive rights to provide products and services under the Joint Venture Agreement.\\n\\n- Clause 20.2 states that except for the e-passport system and National ID card project, the company shall be given first priority to locally manufactured goods and locally provided services which meet the technical specifications, quality standards and economic viability defined by the company.\\n\\nFor the e-passport and National ID card project and where goods manufactured or services provided in Uganda do not meet technical specifications, including quality, quantity, the timeline for delivery and economic viability required by the company, the company shall procure such goods through the consortium as a supplier. Specifically, the consortium shall;\\n\\n- Be the exclusive supplier to the company of raw materials and semi-finished products manufactured by the consortium.\\n- Be the preferred supplier to the company of materials not manufactured by the company.\\n- The consortium shall for the duration of this agreement.\\n- Be the exclusive supplier to the company of machinery manufactured by the consortium.\\n- Be the preferred supplier of machinery for the factory not manufactured by the consortium.\\n\\nIn light of the above, the Consortium shall be the sole supplier for 15 years – which exposes the country to the risk of contract locking and manipulation arising from monopoly.\\n\\nIn addition, the Government of Uganda represented by Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation, Office of the President and Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development shall have no input in the supply of raw materials and machinery which annuls the provisions of the Public Procurement and Disposal of assets.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe transition from Muelhbauer to Uganda Security Printing Company is hinged on the joint agreement between the Government of Uganda and the consortium simply implies a change from one vendor locked-in system to another, together with the corresponding disadvantages amongst which are the following;\\n\\na) Loss of the ability to negotiate prices  \\nb) Vulnerability to unsolicited/forced upgrades  \\nc) Significant costs of conversion of data to a format useable by USPC systems  \\nd) Significant costs in migration of data to the new systems and ultimately corruption and loss of critical data during conversion.  \\ne) Complete decommissioning of Muehlbauer software and hardware that was acquired at hefty prices. These include enrolment kits, computers, personalization machines, quality control scanners, blank polycarbonate national identity cards, servers etc.  \\nf) The transfer of system ownership and handover of source code after 15 years was not clear.\\n\\nI advised Management to consider engaging the Attorney General to review the Joint Venture Agreement and address the aforementioned risks in line with industry standards.\\n\\n**ix.** Basis/Justification for the transition from the M/S Muehlbauer to Uganda Securities Printing Company**\\n\\nProject initiation is a key stage of system development during which the initial concept is prepared, and the business case is developed. It entails the user department justifying the need for a new system and its intended benefits to the organization, defining the scope of the project, establishing available options, rating the criticality of the need, highlighting the project team and preparation of a budget for the project among other related issues.\\n\\nA review of the ongoing transition between the NSIS supplied by Muehlbauer to the National Identity Card system supplied by the Uganda security Information system revealed that the required standard processes were not adequately followed. For instance, no formal and well-documented business case to justify the need for decommissioning of the NSIS was conducted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**x.** Gaps in the ID registration process**\\n\\nDespite heavy investments in ICT solutions, the ID registration process is still manual, where application or registration cannot take place without a manual file. There are unnecessary delays in the transfer of information from the registration kit to the server; the filled data is uploaded onto the server at the end of the day if not week depending on the availability of the Information Technology Officer (ITO) /District Registration Officer (DRO); sometimes, it will require for an ITO from the neighbouring district to do the upload before getting to the central server for processing.\\n\\nThe upload of a filled application to the central server is done using a flash disk, which is prone to theft and errors at the enrolment and processing/ decoding using the manual server upload. Over **10,806,384** IDs had not been processed, especially the IDs that require verification by the committee and over **13,650,427** million IDs had not been picked/issued by clients, some date as far back as 2014.  \\nIt should be noted that all the IDs are due to expire in 2025.\\n\\nThe stated gaps have led to extended delays in processing NIDs, which are likely to prevent the Authority from delivering its mandate. In addition, undelivered cards may expire before issuance.\\n\\nManagement acknowledged that it was true that the current system was offline between the kit and the district server, and it was because at the time of acquisition of the current NSIS system connectivity infrastructure in Uganda had a limitation.\\n\\nI advised Management to consider automating citizen registration processes during the implementation of the new system and fast-track issuance of the cards.\\n\\n**xi.** Lack of a proper inventory management system**\\n\\nI reviewed the National ID inventory system and noted the following;\\n\\n- No formal documented process of tracking the movement of stock/ blank cards\\n- Non-existent validation of incoming inventory from the storage to establish accurate stock counts as blank cards are replenished.\\n- Failure to streamline the put-away, picking, packing, and shipping to prevent misplacements and lost stock.\\n- Lack of a physical verifiable record of the cards designated for destruction.\\n\\n---\\n\\na) Ad hoc Access and Use of Information\\n\\nThere were no approved guidelines by the Board for Access and Use of Information NIRA as required by Regulations 3(7) and Regulation 6(2) of the Registration of Persons (Access and Use of Information) Regulations, 2015 setting out the access protocols and levels for persons, Ministries, Departments or Agencies of Government\\n\\nb) Irregular access and use of NIRA Information service without a valid Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)\\n\\nOut of the **sixty-seven** entities that are connected and share citizenry NSIS data, only **twenty-six** agencies had MoUs with NIRA while **forty-one** did not have any.\\n\\nc) Revenue loss due to Laxity in the enforcement of third-party obligations relating to the usage of data\\n\\nI noted a significant variance of **UGX.5,350,144,980** between the amount that was due to NIRA and actual collections from those agencies using NIRA NSIS data Failure to develop guidelines for information access hinders appraisal of the process and procedures for compliance purposes. In addition, in the absence of an MoU signed with these agencies, the National Register is at great risk of unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality and may also result in loss of NTR.\\n\\nManagement noted that the usage of data by all the agencies referred to had been exempted from paying fees by the Minister in accordance with the Registration of Persons Act, 2015. Management added that guidelines for access levels have been developed and submitted to Solicitor General for review.\\n\\nI advised Management to ensure that all agencies with access to and using NIRA data have valid MoUs. In addition, Management should develop guidelines to ensure work complies with the requirements of the Regulations.\\n\\n**xiii.** Failure by NIRA to execute its mandate on the registration of resident aliens**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.2.2. Information systems audit of the Programme Budgeting System (PBS) at the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MOFPED)**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda has been implementing reforms in the national budgeting system spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MOFPED). The budget system has evolved from the input budgeting approach, Output Oriented Budgeting (OOB) model and to outcome budgeting model to enhance effectiveness, accountability and transparency in Government. The OOB was first implemented using a standalone Output Budgeting Tool (OBT) system based on a Microsoft Access platform. The Ministry is currently implementing the Outcome Budgeting System based on NDP III outcomes.\\n\\nThe Standalone OBT Microsoft Access-based Platform had challenges, such as; Manual budget consolidation; Inability to perform comparability; inadequate automation of updates and upgrades; decentralised database management and absence of interfaces and integration with other systems.\\n\\nIn FY 2018/19, the Government implemented the Programme Based Budgeting System (PBB) to overcome the above challenges and strengthen the link between Government Strategic Objectives stated in the National Development Plan (NDP) II. The Programme Budgeting System (PBS) with a centralised database and application to perform budget preparations and reporting functions with effect FY 2017/18 to address the challenges paused by the OBT is being implemented. The PBS was rolled out to all MDAs including Missions and later, the Local Governments starting FY 2018/19.\\n\\nThe Specific objectives of the PBS include;\\n\\na) Ease and automate the consolidation of budget frameworks papers, estimates, and budget execution reports across MDAs;  \\nb)  \\nAutomate exchange of data with other systems such as IFMS and IPPS;  \\nc)  \\nProvide access to historical budget data by users within MDAs and LGs;  \\nd) Enable central management and maintenance of the application;  \\ne) Improve security management by restricting user access appropriately and delineating roles and responsibilities on the system among users;  \\nf)  \\nAccess from any point with an internet connection.\\n\\n---\\n\\nConsequently, the absence of a strategic plan for MoFPED ICT services led to;\\n\\na) Adhoc IT investment decisions  \\nb)  \\nCreating misalignment between IT initiatives and the Ministry\\'s business strategy and priorities  \\nc)  \\nFrustrating monitoring of service levels and service improvement.  \\nd)  \\nIncreased costs of ICT management.  \\ne)  \\nDuplication of systems and hiring similar Human Resources.\\n\\nManagement explained that the management of IT systems is based on individual departmental ICT plans. The Ministry is in the process of consolidating all ICT systems. Thereafter, will develop the IT Strategic Plan by the end of the first half of this Financial Year.\\n\\nI advised Management to develop, adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy/strategic plan with the involvement of all stakeholders.\\n\\n**ii.** Inappropriate Reporting Line for IT Contract Staff**\\n\\nThe ICT structures of any organisation define employee hierarchy to ease coordination and decision-making in achieving the overall organisation objectives.  \\nManagement through Resource Enhancement and Accountability Programme (REAP), recruited seven (7) IT, staff, with two-year renewable contracts to manage the PBS. The IT staff are categorised as IT Specialists, System Administrators and Systems Officers. A review of the structure and employee responsibilities revealed the following;\\n\\n- The PBS IT staffs were limited to only supporting the Budget Directorate, rather than the entire Ministry.\\n- Some of the staff had specialised skills and expertise like application development and business process analysis that could be applied to support the PBS and other systems owned by the Ministry, however, updates of PBS are still outsourced.\\n- The said staff report to the Director Budget and Commissioner Budget Policy and Department Evaluation, contrary to the macro human resource structure of MoFPED which categorises them under Management of Information Systems.\\n\\nI further noted that the IFMS IT staff also report to the Accountant General instead of reporting to the centralised ICT Structure Director MIS.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**iii.** Non-performance of IT risk assessment and management**\\n\\nPerformance of IT risk assessment and management on a recurrent basis is critical for the successful implementation of IT solutions. The practice determines the likelihood and impact of identified risks and then designs responses to the risks identified, including the performance of a cost-benefit analysis and assigning responsibility for execution.\\n\\nDuring the audit, I observed that risk assessment with regard to the implementation and utilization of PBS had not been performed. PBS shares information across other systems such as IFMS, and IPPS with different risk exposure and there are dependencies among critical business processes, applications and other integral information systems and IT infrastructure components that are subject to risk and vulnerabilities.\\n\\nIn addition, the IT environment is very dynamic and susceptible to vulnerabilities like cyber-attacks and disruptions which may lead to disaster and unavailability of services if the risks are not managed adequately in a proactive rather than reactive approach. This was attributed to the lack of a risk management strategy/policy that would be based on undertaking assessments.\\n\\nManagement explained that the PBS system is hosted on the IFMS infrastructure and its benefits from the IT security policy of the IFMS data centre. Equally, the Government of Uganda (G.O.U) Risk Management Strategy (2018) outlines Technological Risks as one of the categories of risks to address. Further, the PBS relies on support from NITA-U and Uganda Police Force which conduct periodic security and risk assessments.\\n\\nIn addition, the Ministry explained that it is in the process of implementing Enterprise Risk Management and it is expected that this will improve the way risks are identified and managed throughout the different departments of the Ministry.\\n\\nI advised Management to review its current risk management strategy or develop a separate IT Risk Assessment/Management framework that will guide the proactive management of risk.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe lack of active participation in the internal audit function implies that there is no timely detection of errors and identification of risks.\\n\\nManagement indicated that the Ministry has a Forensics, & Risk advisory department, which is in the process of developing the Enterprise Risk Management Frame Work, for the entire government, the IT systems inclusive.\\n\\nFurthermore, management explained that the IT & Performance Department has a core team that was trained in IT audit and rolled out a plan to audit all systems in government including the PBS. Internal audit staff will be made users on the PBS, as recommended.\\n\\nI await the outcome of the Accounting Officer’s actions.\\n\\n**v.** Non-testing of the Data Backup**\\n\\nBackup tests are conducted to verify the completeness and precision of the backup, appraise and evaluate the staff\\'s capability to restore the backup and coordinate the recovery response process.\\n\\nWhereas PBS backups were being undertaken at MoFPED, the backups were not being tested and documented to confirm the completeness and ability of staff to undertake recovery procedures should an adverse disruptive event occur.\\n\\nIt may result in loss of data and uncoordinated disaster response in the event of disruptions.\\n\\nManagement explained that regular backup tests are carried out and they are now documented.\\n\\nI advised Management to design procedures to undertake periodic recovery tests from backups and address any outcome of non-recovery of backed-up data.\\n\\n**vi.** Inadequate internal capacity to operate the system**\\n\\n- During support, when a complaint is raised by a system user, it is handled by the first level of support which is the Business and functional team in the Budget Policy and Evaluation Department (BPED).\\n\\n---\\n\\n- On ascertaining that the issue is not user-related or due to data entry mistakes, it is referred to the PBS in-house IT team for assessment.\\n- It is only issues that cannot be resolved at that level that is forwarded to the PBS consultants for further action. Minor issues are resolved within two (2) hours while major issues are fixed within 24 hours.\\n- Training of the in-house team is an ongoing process despite the continuous upgrades. The Ministry is currently rolling out capacity-building programmes.\\n- With the stabilization of the system, the Internal IT team will be in a position to fully take over maintenance and development activities with minimal support from the consultants.\\n\\nI advised Management to enhance internal capacity through knowledge transfer to local staff to ensure self-reliance and reduce the costs of system maintenance.\\n\\n**vii.** Failure to comprehensively utilize Quality Assurance Services**\\n\\nQuality Assurance services review results and deliverables within the different phases of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and confirm compliance with the system requirements, advise on deviations and recommend process improvements.\\n\\nI noted that the Ministry did not engage independent quality assurance services during the implementation of the system. The review of the contract management file for the EPBS revealed that the vendor would present to management the status of the project and the Annual Technical Support without the Ministry\\'s independent verification of the quality of the deliverables.\\n\\nI was not availed with reports covering quality assurance for key deliverables of the project such as data migration, system integration, stress and functional testing, user acceptance testing, and detailed go-live, among others.\\n\\nThe absence of independent quality assurance exposes the entity to risks of multiple escalations of support, delayed project completion and the system may not meet its functional and systems requirements.\\n\\nManagement indicated that the Ministry works in consultation with the Ministry of ICT, NITA (U), the Uganda Police ICT Directorate, and other MDAs to conduct the user acceptance exercise, upon which the reports are approved. However, that notwithstanding, Management shall implement the Auditor General’s recommendation of acquiring quality assurance services in future projects.  \\nI advised management to ensure that a comprehensive quality assurance process is undertaken during project implementation to enhance compliance with system development.\\n\\n---\\n\\nsystems incidental to PBS such as the IBP among others. The interfaces support transactions using data exchange and integration with Government systems.\\n\\nGoU through NITA-U implemented a data integration platform, the Ug-Hub, to automatically and securely exchange data and services within Government and its strategic partners, improve e-services, reduce development costs, promote data reuse and prevent information redundancy.\\n\\nManagement had explained that the PBS interfaces were planned to be operationalized after the budget planning and preparation activities for the year 2022-2023 are completed and before the budget approval.\\n\\nNon-development and updating of interfaces may lead to errors in the budgeting data and inaccuracy of information between systems. It also compromises the efficiency of the system as created to deliver.\\n\\nManagement further explained that the EPBS interfaces ride on the NITA-U Platform (UG-Hub), which is restricted to PBS, IFMS and HCM. Whereas the HCM interface has been implemented on the platform, the interface with IFMS is currently ongoing and the delay has been attributed to the time lag in upgrading both systems.\\n\\nI advised Management to engage the different stakeholders to ensure the information- sharing interfaces are developed, tested and implemented to support the PBS global role.\\n\\n**ix.** Failure to update changes in the budget figures after supplementary and virements**\\n\\nAn approved supplementary budget allocates additional funding to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) whereas virements reallocate resources to different budget items in a financial year. Supplementary and virements, therefore, change the budgetary figures for the year.\\n\\nA review of the old PBS revealed that changes in the budget (supplementary and virements) after appropriation, preparation and submission of approved budget estimates were not reflected in the final performance reports. Only the original appropriation is uploaded to the system.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised Management to improve PBS reporting templates and ensure the inclusion of supplementary budgets and revised budgets to enhance the accountability and usability of reports.\\n\\n**x.** Absence of a basis for allocation of funds for the PIAPs in the current budgeting cycle**\\n\\nThe NDP III Programmes Implementation Action Plan (PIAP) outlines the key programme elements which are; the Programmes themselves, Sub-programmes, Objectives, Interventions, Outputs, Actions, the Lead implementer and other implementing MDAs for the activities.\\n\\nThe PIAP provides annual estimates of financial resources to be invested by the Government to realise the goal of the NDP III. It also consolidates the financial resources required to implement the actions of all the 20 Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs). The resources are disaggregated by Programme and by the MDAs and LGs responsible for their implementation.\\n\\nHowever, I noted that the budget ceilings/MTEFs set for the several programmes, sub- programmes, objectives and interventions do not match with the annual set figures in the PIAP. The MTEFs are not set based on the PIAP estimates set, yet the MDAs are required to report deliverables and perform using the PIAP outputs/indicators.\\n\\nA sample of PIAPs and appropriated figures for FY 22/23 shown in the table below indicate variances in budget figures for several programmes with some such as Human Capital Development having allocations exceeding the PIAP allocation by **UGX.2,711.43 Bn** and an overall deviation of **UGX.8,633.12 Bn** less than the PIAP projected figures for the same FY.\\n\\n**Table 74: NDP III Public sector Budget Allocations against Approved Budget** **estimates FY 22/23 for selected programmes**  \\n**Programme**  \\n**NDP III Public sector Revised Annual** The variance Percentage Budget Allocations Budget between annual Variances** **(Ugx Bn.)

The five strategic objectives are;\\n\\n- Enhance value addition in Key Growth Opportunities\\n- Strengthen private sector capacity to drive growth and create jobs\\n- Consolidate & increase stock and quality of Productive Infrastructure\\n- Enhance the productivity and social well-being of the population and\\n- Strengthen the role of the State in development.\\n\\nThe measurement basis of the indicators in PBS is fixed in percentage even for indicators which can be measured in other forms such as days, currency among others, as indicated in table below;\\n\\n**Table 75: PIAP indicators and their measurement**  \\n**Indicator**  \\n**Measurement in PIAPs** Measurement basis in PBS** Average monthly nominal UGX Percentage household Income  \\nNet annual no. of jobs created  \\nNumber of Jobs  \\nPercentage Energy generation capacity Megawatts Percentage Water usage  \\nLife expectancy at birth\\n\\nM3 per capita  \\nPercentage Years Percentage Maternal Mortality Ratio/100,000, No per 100,000  \\nPercentage\\n\\nTravel Time with GKMA  \\nTravel Time on Railway Network\\n\\nMin/Km Percentage Days Percentage\\n\\nFreight Cargo Traffic Tones Percentage The unit cost of Internet  \\nUSD Percentage\\n\\nFailure to link the NDP III objectives’ indicators to the reporting output indicators leads to misleading reporting of the achievements.\\n\\nManagement explained that data on PIAPs was loaded on the PBS based on a submission from NPA. Nonetheless, the Ministry reconciled the indicators with NPA as part of the ongoing review of the NDP III.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWithout the ability to plan and budget for their activities and having to depend on the approval of the finance and administration department for the allocation and releases, the work of the internal audit function will be grossly affected hence leading to a conflict of interest.\\n\\nFailure to have an independent internal audit unit weakens the internal controls in an organisation since it will have to seek approval and release its resources from Management.\\n\\nManagement explained that the creation of Departments on the PBS is premised on the approved structure by the Ministry of Public Service.\\n\\nIn the spirit of good governance, management should configure the PBS system to enable the internal audit units and/or departments to independently budget for their activities.\\n\\n**4.2.3. Information systems audit of the Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) at Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT)**\\n\\nThe Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) is a project by the Ministry of Works and Transport to license drivers and improve safety on the country’s roads. It is run by the Uganda Security Printing Company (USPC), which is a joint venture between the state- owned Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation (UPPC) and M/S Veridos GmbH, a German firm.\\n\\nUDLS is a System used in production and issuance of computerised driving licenses by USPC on behalf of Government. UDLS Development project commenced in 2020 and became operational in March 2021. USPC replaced M/S Face Technologies whose contract had expired on 28th February 2021.\\n\\nThe major processes of UDLS include; Application for the Driver License (Reception- Front Desk), Client enrolment/Biometric data capture/Live Scan, Approval/Validation of the client data captured, Payments for the Driver’s Permit, Driver’s Permit-Card Production and Driver’s Permit Issuance to the clients who can access services from the Kampala office and the six (6) regional offices i.e., Mbarara, Fort Portal, Jinja, Mbale, Gulu and Arua.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the absence of complete expenditure records for both Capital and Operational costs, I could not assess the extent of investment made by USPC at the time of the audit.\\n\\nManagement had requested in their letter dated 25th March 2022 for an extension of the audit period in which they had hoped to provide the outstanding documents. However, the documents remained outstanding despite the extension of the audit period.\\n\\nI implored Management to ensure that investment records are properly kept to track the USPC investment.\\n\\n**ii.** Management of UDLS Project Assets**\\n\\nI noted the following inconsistencies in the Management of UDLS Assets;\\n\\na)  \\nSub-contract of UDLS Asset Acquisition to Technology Associates (TA) and Integrated Transport Solutions Limited (ITSL\\n\\nI established that Ms Technology Associates (TA) was outsourced by M/S Veridos GmbH and Veridos Uganda to manage capital acquisitions contrary to the Joint Venture agreement. In addition, I noted that the Integrated Transport Solutions Limited (ITSL) was contracted to manage Human Resource Management, Project Management and strategic communication support however, it was also involved in the acquisition of capital assets such as computers, furniture etc. for the project, which was outside their contractual scope.\\n\\nContracting a third party outside the Joint Venture casts doubt on the capacity of M/S Veridos and could result in a contractual breach, affecting the project\\'s intended objectives. This also impedes proper contract management.\\n\\nb) Gaps in Asset Management I noted the that;\\n\\n- Of the 807 items recorded in the USPC/UDLS asset register,165 items did not have their unit prices and acquisition dates captured despite the items being in existence.\\n- Physical inspection and verification established that the enrolment van valued at UGX.529,073,801 could not be accessed since it was purportedly still with M/S Technology Associates which was contracted outside the Joint Venture.\\n\\n- Four enrollment kits (Laxlon mobile case with enrolment) valued at UGX.144 Mn are still housed at URC UDLS headquarters due to delayed operationalisation of the enrollment van.\\n\\n- A number of assets were obsolete and unfit for use by the time they were handed over.\\n\\n- Although three project motor vehicles had been passed over to the MoWT, with registration numbers UAT 377W, UAT 829P and UAU 921T in the makes of Prado Golden, Premio grey and Premio silver white, I noted that the transfer process of these vehicles to the Ministry had not been completed by the time of the audit.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn light of the above, I could not confirm the accuracy of the asset register, assets inherited from Face Technologies and those procured by the Joint Venture reported in the asset register.\\n\\nManagement indicated that it was committed by 31 st August 2022 to transfer all the project assets to the names of USPC and mainstream all subcontracts in relation to the main Contract between USPC and MoWT.\\n\\nI await the outcome of management’s efforts towards streamlining their asset management.\\n\\n**iii.** Lack of interface with critical systems**\\n\\nUDLS lacked automated interfaces with key systems such as the Police Verification System (PVS) used to issue and verify certificates of competence (CoC) and the Refugees Management Information System (RIMS) operated by the Office of the Prime (OPM) for Refugee biodata verification to enable refugees to possess Driving Licenses.\\n\\nAs a result, I established that CoC from the Inspector of Vehicles is manually captured. This exposed the entity to risk of errors in critical government data and irregularities associated with human interventions and incomplete information.\\n\\nManagement acknowledged that it is true that UDLS is not yet linked to the Police system and the Refugees Management Information System (RIMS) of OPM, however, it was a work in progress.\\n\\nI advised Management to ensure that the UDLS is integrated with appropriate key Government systems after consultation with key stakeholders.\\n\\n**iv. IT risk management framework.**\\n\\nI reviewed the UDLS risk management practices in line with the best practices and I noted that the entity had no IT risk management framework and as a result, there was no proactive management of IT Risk.\\n\\nGiven the dynamic nature of the IT environment, risks emerge continuously, and some may culminate into disastrous outcomes if left unchecked.\\n\\n---\\n\\nManagement explained that USPC had no internal audit function; the Ministry would engage USPC to establish the internal audit function in order to minimise the risks.\\n\\nI advised Management to work with those charged with governance at MoWT to ensure that an internal audit function is established and that it is properly equipped with the necessary tools to enable it get fully involved in the review of the information systems.\\n\\n**vi.** IT Continuity Plans/Disaster Recovery Plan**\\n\\nBest practice requires and ICT project to have a BCP/DRP. At the time of the audit, USPC had not developed an IT continuity plan to reduce the impact of a significant disruption on key business functions and processes in case of disaster. This could lead to major disruptions in the business, including loss of revenue in an event that risks materialise.\\n\\nManagement acknowledged that there was no documented IT Disaster Recovery Plan. However, there was a Data Recovery Centre installed with a fireproof door, fire detection & suppression system with real time duplication of the UDLS database with a Recovery Point Objective of 5 minutes.\\n\\nManagement committed to engage USPC to document the measures in place into an IT Disaster Recovery Plan.  \\nI advised Management to implement a formal IT continuity and disaster recovery strategy to ensure that IT continues to serve the business in whatever circumstances.\\n\\n**vii. Overlapping/conflicting roles**\\n\\nA review of the system user roles and responsibilities revealed that some system users at UDLS hold conflicting roles for instance: some users had administrative access to both application and databases; programmers had access to system production environments, and some support staff had privileges to print learners’ permits.\\n\\nAll these violations put the entity at a high risk of undetected misuse of user rights and potential loss of revenue.\\n\\nManagement committed to engage USPC to implement the recommended actions.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised Management to develop an IT security policy/plan in consultation with other stakeholders and in compliance with the industry standards.\\n\\n**ix. System unavailability on Saturdays**\\n\\nWhereas the UDLS is expected to provide services from Monday to Saturday, I noted instances of system downtime, especially on Saturdays thus denying services to clients.\\n\\nSystem downtime affects service delivery to clients and hampers the envisaged benefits of the system availability.\\n\\nManagement acknowledged the concern and stated that the occurrences were as a result of unstable internet bandwidth. Further, management indicated that the Ministry was engaging NIRA to provide a redundant data line for backup in case of service breakdown.\\n\\nI advised Management to ensure system availability in a bid to extend services to citizens as envisaged.\\n\\n**4.3.** HIGHLIGHTS OF VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT RESULTS**\\n\\n**4.3.1. Government of Uganda’s Efforts to Eliminate Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Line with the Nationally Agreed Target Linked to SDG 5.2**\\n\\nIn September 2015, the Government of Uganda committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, one of whose targets (Target 5.2.1) aims at eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including Intimate Partner Violence against Women (EIPVW).\\n\\nUganda recorded a decrease in intimate partner violanece between from 60% to 56% in the years between 2011 and 2016. This is however higher than the global average of 35%. There was a reported 30% increase in violence aganainst women and girls since the outbreak of COVID-19. The police crime report 2019/20 indicated a 29% rise in domestic violence cases from 13,693 to 17,664 between 2019 to 2020.\\n\\nIt is from the above background that I conducted an audit whose overall objective was to assess Government of Uganda’s efforts to eliminate Intimate Partner Violence against women in line with the nationally agreed target linked to SDG 5.2.\\n\\n- A general increase in Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in 2021 compared to 2016 regardless of the level of education attained, age group, or sub region. Sexual and psychological violence rose by 11% and 7% respectively, while physical violence reduced by 1% over the same period. The rise was linked to the COVID- 19 restrictions that increased exposure of victims and limited access to prevention and response services for GBV.\\n\\n- The higher the level of education of women and girls, the lower the level of IPV experienced/reported, in both 2016 and 2020. For instance, in 2020, only 19.4% of women who studied beyond secondary school level reported physical or sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, compared to 38.3% of the women and girls who never obtained formal education.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Acholi sub-region had the highest prevalence of IPVW (64.9%), followed by Bukedi (60.3%) and Karamoja (49.9%) sub regions. Five sub-regions in the Central, western and south western (Ankole, Tooro, Bunyoro, Busoga and South Central) registered a decline in cases of physical and /or sexual violence against women and girls between 2016 and 2020, while the other ten sub-regions registered increased incidents. South Central sub-region recorded the highest decline in reported IPVW cases- from 24.2% in 2016 to 15% in 2020, a reduction of 9.2 percentage points.\\n\\n- Uganda generally has in place a coherent legal, policy and institutional framework at national level (and partially at local government level) to combat GBV/ IPV, although some critical legislation addressing aspects of IPVW are not yet complete. These include the Sexual Offences Bill, Legal Aid Bill and Policy and the review of the Domestic Violence Act and Regulations, 2010.\\n\\n- That whereas the National Action Plan for Elimination of GBV (2016 - 2021) sought a budget of UGX 89.67 billion to facilitate implementation of all identified interventions for eliminating all forms of GBV over the five-year period, only UGX 10 billion was mobilised. 90% (UGX 9 billion) of this financing came through donor financing thereby raising a sustainability challenge.\\n\\n- That staffing for officers responsible for GBV interventions in local governments stood at an average of 40% for the twelve districts visited. The low number of staff involved in GBV interventions in the districts is aggravated by the fact that these few officers are also central to coordination, development, implementation of culture and community-based services, programmes and projects in the district and urban councils thus limiting the time allocated to GBV issues in the districts.\\n- Only 18 (with 20 shelters) of the 135 districts countrywide had shelters with a combined capacity of 280 GBV victims. However, MoGLSD did not have a budget provision for the day to day running of these shelters and at the time of audit, they were all run by NGOs financed by development partners. This deprives GBV victims in the remaining 117 districts of shelter services or makes it costly for them to access the shelters. For instance, some sub-regions that recorded a high prevalence of IPV cases amongst women and girls in 2020- such as Kigezi (38.8%) and Lango (34.6%) - did not have any shelters.\\n\\n- Although UBOS, in collaboration with MoGLSD, developed and localized the indicators for measuring progress on intimate partner violence, and included them in the National Statistical Indicator Framework (NSI) update of 2018, the framework does not provide periodic targets against which progress can be measured prior to 2030.\\n\\n- There was limited enrolment of districts onto the National GBV database (only 94 out of 135), and limited utilisation of the database by the districts enrolled (20% in 2019, and 57% in 2021). There is also no interface between Police records and the HMIS. This leads to shortcomings in data sharing between different actors to whom IPV cases are reported.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\uf0fc Investigate the major causes of the IPV prevalence rates in the different regions of the country to ensure targeted and specific interventions are made to address the vice.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Prioritise the review, development and/or update of the pending legal, policy and institutional frameworks aimed at EIPVW and more actively engage key stakeholders in the development of EIPVW policies and legislation including victims of IPV, local governments and religious/ cultural institutions to ensure that all views are considered and the needs of those most vulnerable to IPV are addressed.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Collaborate with MoFPED to mobilise funds necessary to operationalise the institutional arrangements stipulated in the National Action Plan for Elimination of GBV for effective coordination and implementation of IPV interventions.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Liaise with MoFPED and NPA to provide a specified budget code for GBV interventions in the budget framework papers for all responsible MDAs and LGs. This forms a basis of lobbying for GBV interventions in the budgeting process and also facilitates identification of groups vulnerable to GBV for special consideration.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Engage all IPV/GBV partner agencies and LGs to recruit or appoint and train IPV/GBV responsible persons and in collaboration with relevant partners lay out detailed strategies for protection and rehabilitation of the victims of IPV through establishment of shelters providing resources for their routine operations.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAlthough the Government of Uganda committed to eliminate Intimate Partner Violence against women and girls by 2030 (SDG Target 5.2.1), the audit noted an increase in incidences of IPVW in 2020 as compared to 2016, presenting a risk that Uganda will not meet the aforementioned SDG target unless deliberate interventions are implemented to address the gaps noted in this report. Achievement of tangible progress towards elimination of IPVW by 2030 will require multi-stakeholder engagement and adoption of a whole-of-government approach to ensure no one is left behind.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis audit was instituted following public outcry arising from delayed/ inadequate response to emergencies in the country, a high proportion of seriously injured causalities in need of emergency services. This was informed by the Uganda police annual crime reports and the COVID-19 epidemic cases that tested the health services’ preparedness to handle medical emergencies. I noted that the sector faced challenges in responding to emergencies across the country.\\n\\nThe objective of the audit was to assess the efforts of the Ministry of Health in ensuring provision of quality emergency care services in the country.\\n\\nAlthough there are notable achievements, for instance: development of the EMS Policy 2021; EMS Strategy 2020/21-2024/25 and EMS norms and standards for ambulances as key legislations; and development of 12 indicators to track EMS delivery in the country which are existent in the DHIS 2 platform and setting up and operationalization of two regional call and dispatch centres at Naguru and Masaka Regional Referral Hospitals (RRHs) audit noted the following areas for improvement.\\n\\nInspite of the above achievement, the following were observed;\\n\\n- MoH had not developed 75% (15 out of 20) of key legislations as stipulated in the WHO framework at different EMS levels, at the time of the audit. The undeveloped legislation include; the Bystander protection legislation and the EMS Act to enable the government to enforce desirable EMS practices among others. I also noted that the EMS Policy, Strategy, norms and standards of ambulances were not widely disseminated to the people in communities and staff in the EMS units who are the implementers and providers of EMS services.\\n\\n- Twelve (12) out of the fourteen (14) regional call and dispatch centres representing 86% supposed to be set up and operationalized by MoH had not been set up by the time of the report. The ministry had not operationalized the universal medical access or toll free number/ three (3) digit code for access of emergency medical services by patients and health facilities.\\n\\n- MoH had no comprehensive database for existing ambulances. Mismatches were observed in the actual numbers of ambulances attached to some of the facilities compared with those of the ambulance census report.\\n\\n- the undesirable 178 type A government ambulances had not been phased out by the intended deadline of end of the FY 2020/2021. Procurement of ambulances was neither planned nor included in the EMS departmental budgets for the period under review.\\n\\n- None of the procured 12 boat ambulances were allocated or deployed to any of the island districts as planned but left idle at the Entebbe marine base for over a year, defeating the objective of securing these ambulances and undermining the value for money of USD1,870,714 and UGX 1,347,480,000 spent on procurement of these boat ambulances.\\n\\n- Seventy-Five per cent (75%) of the ambulances, subjected to the checklist tool to assess the minimum equipment and supplies stipulated in the National operating guidelines and standards for ambulances, lacked all the required\\n\\n---\\n\\nminimum basic life support equipment and supplies. In effect they only act as transport vehicles.\\n\\n- Sixteen (16) out of eighteen (18), representing 89% of the visited health facilities had no fully dedicated personnel in their emergency units to manage emergency cases yet visited Health Centres IVS, on average, receive 2-5 emergency cases a day while general hospitals receive 10-30 emergency cases a day on average.\\n\\n- MoH had not reviewed the Uganda National Minimum Health Care package to prioritize emergency care at Health facility level and in the pre-hospital phase. None of the visited health facilities/hospitals across all levels were aware of the standard essential emergency medicine and supplies list to guide the planning and placing emergency medicine orders to NMS. Facilities/hospitals instead utilised the general Essential medicines and health supplies list to place orders to the NMS.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to address the identified challenges through;\\n\\n\\uf0fc Prioritise, plan and budget for development of the relevant legislations and laws for management of EMS in its annual operational plans\\n\\n\\uf0fc Develop, disseminate and institutionalise standard emergency medical equipment lists for basic life support equipment necessary at the different levels of health care and prioritise their procurement for the emergency units across the different health facilities.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Prioritise the development and specification of an emergency medicines and supplies list and incorporate it into the Uganda Essential medicines and Health supplies list.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Engage Uganda Communication Commission and Telecom companies to prioritise the operationalization of the standard national three-digit toll free number for the management of EMS cases. Set up and operationalize the national and all regional call centres\\n\\n\\uf0fc Government through MoH should prioritise procurement of Type B and Type C ambulances in its annual budgets and operational plans in order to increase their accessibility to the public as well as fostering delivery of quality EMS care during transportation of patients\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\uf0fc Fast track the establishment of the multi-stakeholder coordination committee and implement the Public Private Partnership Health strategies to ease provision of quality EMS across the country.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn order to facilitate the efficient delivery of emergency medical services in the country, the Ministry of Health through the EMS department was meant to develop appropriate legislations for EMS, institute desirable stakeholder coordination arrangements, ensure availability of emergency medical equipment, medicines and supplies in established emergency units across the country, establish and operationalize national and regional call and dispatch centres, train health care providers in EMS practices, procure desirable ambulances and undertake monitoring and evaluation of EMS delivery in the country. The findings reveal weaknesses at every level of what should be a critical component in the health care system. The desirable strategies are still hampered by weak EMS M&E systems and inadequate coordination and institutional arrangements for delivery of EMS in the country.\\n\\n**4.3.3. Implementation of Small-Mini-Independent Power Producers Under the Getfit Scheme in Uganda**\\n\\nThe Energy sector was liberalized following cabinet approval of the Power Sector Reforms and Privatization Strategy (PSRPS) in 1999. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) was established to regulate the Electricity sub-sector while the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) is charged with Policy Formulation. In an attempt to stimulate private investment in small-scale renewable energy projects, ERA adopted a Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFiT) phase II scheme in 2012. However, the scheme did not attract the needed investment as the proposed tariff levels were widely viewed by investors as insufficient for new projects and high financing and project development costs made small-scale power projects unviable, even as the demand for power kept growing.\\n\\nTo respond to the challenges for the small-scale projects, ERA and the German Development Bank (KfW), developed and implemented the Global Energy Transfer (GET FiT) Program in 2012.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn light of the foregoing justification, I instituted this audit with the overall objective of the to evaluate the performance of small/mini IPPs and examine mechanisms instituted by ERA to ensure that they generate affordable, accessible, reliable and environmentally friendly electricity in Uganda.\\n\\nThe audit made the following observations;\\n\\n- There was lack of competition during procurement of IPPs to the extent that 15 out of the 17 sampled small/mini hydro power plants, which commenced construction and were commissioned after the enactment of the PPP Act 2015 and PPP regulations 2016, were not subjected to any competition before securing the sites. Only the two (2) sampled solar plants (Tororo and Soroti) were secured through a competitive process. Audit could not confirm whether value for money had been achieved by the selected firms.\\n\\n- In 2018, 20% of the planned energy generation from GET FiT projects was not delivered to the grid due to missing or inadequate grid infrastructure. Similarly, in 2019 and 2020; 23% and 25% of the energy generation from GET FiT power plants respectively failed to reach the national grid due to grid availability issues. This resulted into deemed (unutilised) energy claims amounting to USD10,955,149 as of June 2020. So far Government of Uganda has paid US$ 3,605,267 on deemed energy comprising US$ 668,186 and US$ 2,937,081 for the FYs 2018/2019 & 2019/2020 respectively due to pay or take contractual clauses in the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Deemed energy charged through the tariff negatively impacts on consumers prices, which is a hindrance to electricity demand, thus slowing economic growth.\\n\\n- The Government of Uganda undertook both GET FiT and REFiT II program interventions in the electricity sub-sector; However, different small/mini plants were offered different tariffs and plants with low planned installed capacity attracted a high tariff compared to those with relatively high installed capacity. There were no uniform criteria used for the tariff offers, this can lead to subjectivity and hence collusion.\\n\\n- Seven (7) out of the fourteen (14) operational GET FIT small/mini power plants delayed signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) ranging between 3 months to 4 years. Accordingly, of the 17 GETFIT small/mini power plants, 14 had been commissioned and were operational by the year 2020, while the 3 were still under construction as they faced challenges. Also, only 5 out of the 14 operational power plants namely; Kakira Muvumbe SHP, Nkusi SHP, Rwimi SHP and Tororo solar power plant achieved their annual planned generation in the year 2020. Three (3) plants namely; Rwimi SHP, Lubilia SHP, and Nkusi SHP were below the required plant availability that is 92%, 86% and 92% in 2020. This delays the intended benefits of the scheme.\\n\\n- An MOU signed between ERA and NEMA, dated 21st July 2016, required ERA and NEMA to undertake joint inspections of projects and activities to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For all the inspections undertaken by ERA for the last 3 years, there was no evidence of NEMA involvement. Whereas ERA identified and reported a number of environmental concerns during their annual compliance audits, there was no evidence of sharing such findings with NEMA for appropriate action as provided for by the MOU.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Chief Executive Officer of ERA to:\\n\\n\\uf0fc Ensure for future projects, sites for the small/mini power plant are competitively secured by potential developers to enhance economic and social-economic benefits from these projects.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Engage key stakeholders as MEMD, UEDCL, and UETCL to improve network availability and efficiency through establishment of dedicated evacuation lines as a way of mitigating grid failure. The upgrades of substations and evacuation lines should be timely undertaken and maintained to avoid unnecessary deemed energy claims.\\n\\n\\uf0fc  \\nEnsure that the licensing procedures for IPPs are streamlined to ensure equitable licensing periods offered to all license applicants. In addition, full operationalization of the coordination with sister agencies that have MoUs with ERA like NEMA and DWRM should be prioritized to facilitate timely licensing processes, monitoring and followup.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Consider subsidizing the final consumer tariffs so as to grow the electricity connectivity specifically in rural areas if the GET FiT program is to realize its intended objectives of securing energy supply at relatively affordable cost.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nSince the inception of the GeTFiT programme in 2013, an amount of 122MW of power had been added to the generation mix by the beneficiaries of the scheme by 2020 with 14 out of 17 plants commissioned. Despite the availability of such capacity, a significant amount of that production was lost due to lack of transmission and distribution lines to evacuate the power. There were also noted lower plant availability rates due to internal outages and low fuel availability. As such government continues to pay deemed costs for such unevaluated power.\\n\\nAs such the tariff charged is not cost reflective and is still high compared to the region. Because of the above, the envisaged increase in number of rural electricity accessibility has not been achieved. The objective of low carbon development, poverty reduction and climate change mitigation may not be achieved in the planned period.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.3.4. Promotion of Safe and Sustainable Management of Electronic Waste in Uganda by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and National Guidance**\\n\\nUganda, just like the rest of the world, is contending with the increased demand for Electronic and Electric Equipment (EEE) products and high technology replacement rates which together, have contributed to the emergence of e-waste as the fastest growing waste stream on earth. Whereas the Government of Uganda has expressed commitment to promoting, among other things, sound management of hazardous chemicals and e-waste, through enactment of an E-waste Policy (2012) and E-waste Strategy (2013), there is scanty up-to-date information on the quantities and types of waste generated in Uganda, and this limits the effectiveness of any planned interventions.\\n\\nIn light of the foregoing justification, I instituted this audit with the overall objective of establishing the quantities of e-waste in Uganda and assess the measures put in place by the Ministry of Information, Communications Technology and National Guidance to promote safe and sustainable management of electronic waste in Uganda.\\n\\na)  \\nThe quantities of electronic waste in Uganda have been increasing exponentially over the last 20 years, and this trend is likely to continue if appropriate interventions are not undertaken. From 2001 to 2020, about 1.3 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in Uganda, with only three (3) dominant categories, namely: screens, monitors and equipment containing screens; large equipment (excluding photovoltaic panels); and temperature exchange equipment accounting for nearly 83% of this waste. However, the most dominant categories of e-waste have kept changing over the years.\\n\\nb) I noted that the strategy for implementation of E-Waste 2013-2018 had 8 strategic objectives with a total of 84 performance indicators. Out of the 84 indicators, only 3 indicators were fully implemented (4%), 7 indicators were partially implemented (8%) and 74 were not implemented (88%). I further examined the implementation of the strategy and noted the following;\\n\\n\\uf0a7  \\nAlthough NEMA had incorporated e-waste related issues into the National Environment Act, 2019 and the National Waste Management Regulations, 2020, review of the E-waste Policy by MoICT&NG was still on-going, over five years after its expected completion date (2016).This has delayed alignment of government interventions to keep abreast with the rapid changes in technological innovation, evolution of the nature and patterns of e-waste, and best practices in e-waste management.\\n\\n---\\n\\non site, while others used unlicensed handlers to dispose of it. In November 2021, however, three firms were licenced by NEMA to transport e-waste and an e-waste collection and management facility set up by the National Enterprise Corporation in Bugolobi. Nonetheless, most entities and stakeholders remained unaware that licensed e-waste handlers/facilities were now available for use.\\n\\nc)  \\nI noted that, apart from the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) and Uganda Communication Commission which made efforts to guide their stakeholders on disposal mechanisms for radiation-emitting equipment and telecommunication towers/masts, like take- back or extraction and storage of radioactive component(s) of broken-down equipment, there was no indication of what other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and local governments did to guide on- or enforce compliance with- proper e-waste management practices for equipment under their dockets.\\n\\nd) UNBS had not developed adequate standards and testing capacity for all Electronic and Electric Equipment entering the country yet imports contribute almost 99% of EEE Put on the Uganda Market. Various potentially hazardous electronic and electronic equipment had thus been imported in the country without testing and could ultimately affect people’s health\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and National Guidance (MoICT& NG) to;\\n\\n\\uf0fc In collaboration with key stakeholders develop mechanisms to project and establish quantities and composition of e-waste and categories of e-waste handlers to aid medium and long-term planning for proper management.\\n\\n\\uf0fc During the anticipated review/ revision of the e-waste strategy, consult and/or involve all key stakeholders to ensure ownership of its implementation. In the interim, MoICT&NG should engage MoFPED, MoES and other stakeholders to ensure funding of e-waste activities and mainstreaming of e-waste management in curricula during the next curriculum reviews.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Engage NEMA to expedite licensing of e-waste handlers and formulation of e- waste management procedures to enhance regulation, identify and engage private actors to set up other waste management centres (PPPs) as envisioned in the National e-waste Strategy.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe budget for implementation of the e-waste strategy was only financed to a tune of 14%; there was limited enforcement of e-waste management practices, recourse to unlicensed e-waste management companies and handlers, and inadequate testing of EEE at importation.\\n\\nLimited implementation of the E-waste strategy was mostly attributed to failure by MoICT&NG to take the lead in its implementation by prioritising funding for the activities assigned to the Ministry, lack of coordination and engagement of all other key players to fulfil their roles. These deficiencies expose people and ecosystems to the potential health and contamination risks associated with e-waste. It is hoped that implementation of the proposed audit recommendations will contribute significantly to improved management of e-waste in Uganda.\\n\\n**4.3.5. Effectiveness of Mechanisms Established for Management of Road Equipment by the Ministry of Works and Transport**\\n\\nThe maintenance of roads in Uganda is currently implemented through the force account mechanism. This requires government agencies to make use of their available man power and equipment in the maintenance of the road network, instead of the lengthy and usually expensive contracting to private firms. To operationalize this mechanism, the Government of Uganda spent a sum of **UGX.887Bn** between 2012 and 2020 on the acquisition, distribution, training, maintenance and monitoring of its road maintenance fleet. This equipment was distributed to local governments across the country.\\n\\nThe initiative has faced challenges in its implementation such as complaints of obsolete equipment with high breakdown rates, delays in repair of equipment at the mechanical workshops and inadequate inventory of equipment to cover the various road maintenance interventions. There are increasing complaints and evidence of deteriorating road conditions in the country.\\n\\nThe Overall objective of the audit was to assess the mechanisms established by the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) for management and utilisation of road equipment.\\n\\n- I noted that in the period of assessment, from 2017/18 to 2019/20, the road maintenance backlog had increased from 42,248KMs at the start for the period to 69,016KMs at the end of the period representing an increase of 37.6% in spite of the government interventions in form of road equipment and funds through Uganda Road Fund.\\n\\n- From 2012 to 2020 Government of Uganda acquired a total of 1,843 pieces of road maintenance equipment which were all distributed to the intended beneficiaries. I however noted that, of this only 1,151 (62%) pieces were in working condition, 645 (35%) pieces grounded though in serviceable state and 47 (3%) broken down and due for disposal. This further explains the increased backlogs in maintenance and deteriorating road conditions\\n\\n- In regard to shared zonal equipment, audit established that out of the 1,843 equipment, fifty seven (57) specialised heavy equipment were distributed to 4 MoWT Zonal Centres which serve 135 districts and MDAs directly carrying out road maintenance works. This was insufficient in quantity. In addition, MoWT\\n\\n---\\n\\nonly acquired 9 low beds to aid the movement of heavy equipment between different sites. This number was not sufficient to serve the LGs who equally did not have low beds of their own. This led to long lead times (average of one year) for mobilisation of equipment and subsequently resulting in delays for road maintenance activities\\n\\n- In regard to repair of road equipment, for a sample of 30 LGs, I established that equipment that underwent major repairs at the regional workshops on average spent a period of 3.25 months in the workshops, additionally two (2) (Gulu and Mbarara) of the four Regional mechanical workshops lacked sheltered work floor space and work tools to efficiently repair and service the equipment under their care. That further explains the delays to repair and service the equipment. This leads to delays in provision of the needed maintenance services.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Works and Transport to;\\n\\n\\uf0fc Ensure that a needs assessment is undertaken prior to implementing such countrywide programs. In the event of limited funding, management should also explore the option of piloting such programs in fewer districts for effectiveness.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Expedite the development of the MIS systems such that information relating to the distribution of shared equipment can be seamlessly captured to streamline the scheduling, distribution, operation and movement of equipment. The Information system will also ensure that all repair requests are well documented and communicated and strict pre repair inspection carried out so that the defects have been promptly reported.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Continue to negotiate with MoFPED to ensure that the necessary funding is availed to facilitate the retooling process and ensure availability of safe sheltered working areas for the Regional Mechanical Workshops (RMWs) staff.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe increase in the road maintenance backlog was attributed to ineffective implementation of the equipment management mechanisms by both the MoWT and the respective agencies in the Works sector. There were noted incidences of lack of needs assessment hence inadequate equipment, rampant breakdowns, lack of training of operators, delays in repairs and lack of monitoring by MoWT.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.3.6. A Value for Money Audit Report on the Regulation and Promotion of Safe and Reliable Public Road Transport System by The Ministry of Works and Transport**\\n\\nThe Dominance of road transport as a mode of transportation in Uganda accounts for more than 90 percent of passenger transit and cargo freight. Even though public road transport is the most popular method of transportation, the Public Transport Industry has a number of obstacles: only buses are fully regulated, Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) services are not timetabled or integrated, and PSVs are typically in Dangerous Mechanical Conditions (DMCs). . The situation is made worse by the usage of uncontrolled commercial motorcycles (Boda bodas) that breach traffic regulations the absence of implementation of institutional and regulatory procedures for enhancing public transportation.\\n\\nTaxis, Minibuses, and Commercial Motorcycles operate off-route and will stop wherever a passenger desires to board or exit. According to Uganda\\'s yearly crime statistics (2017-2021), there were a total of 74,977 victims of traffic accidents, the bulk of which were caused by Careless or Reckless Driving and Dangerous Mechanical Conditions.\\n\\nIn light of the above, the Office of the Auditor General conducted a Value for Money audit to assess Government of Uganda’s efforts in Regulation and Promotion of a Safe and Reliable Public road transport system in Uganda through the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT). Below is a summary of the Key findings which details are in Chapter Four of this report.\\n\\nAlthough the Department of Transport Regulation and Safety, of the Ministry of Works and Transport, has been recognized for notable accomplishments in the promotion of a reliable and safe public transport system, such as the significant improvement (from 5 working days in 1990 to 20 Minutes in 2022) in the time between applying for and receiving a driver\\'s license, the following key areas of improvement were identified:\\n\\n- Field inspections established that majority of Public Service Vehicles (PSV) were in operation but not registered in the Ministry’s database. Although the data records at the Ministry show that they have licensed, on average, 28,000 PSVs per annum during the last 5 years, data obtained from the PSV owners’ associations indicate that, as of November 2022, the registered member PSVs were 749,600. Furthermore, the Ministry\\'s register lacked information such as Licensed Stages, Licensed Routes of Operation, and Time Schedules, which may have contributed to the efficient operation of public transportation.\\n\\n- 139 (70%) out of the randomly sampled 200 PSVs did not possess Valid PSV licenses that would allow them to operate Public transport business. The largest numbers without licences are the boda bodas (95%). As a result, vehicles are used for public transport without validation checks for their road worthiness. In addition Government of Uganda loses UGX29.5 Billion annually in Non-Tax revenue due to non-licensed PSVs operating in the country.\\n\\n- I noted that only 5.73% (140,577 out of the required 2,455,363) PSV inspections were undertaken by the Ministry of Works and Transport during the period under review. The lack of PSV inspections was more prevalent in the Commercial Motor Cycle category and Taxis. This was caused by lack of personnel and the required equipment to conduct PSV inspections across the country and the delayed implementation of the SGS Automotive Services Uganda contract. The Public is thus exposed to risks of vehicles in poor mechanical conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- I noted for the few inspections that were carried out by the Ministry, these were conducted with the use of observation. MoWT lacks the facilities, key equipment such as; Screen Type headlight tester/ Light intensity tester, Speedometer tester, Break speed combination Tester, Digital Tyre tread depth gauge among others. The absence of quality inspections does not guarantee the roadworthiness of PSVs examined.\\n\\n- I noted that 34% (77 out of 226) of the inspected driving schools were operating without valid operating licenses issued by the Ministry of Works and Transport. As a result, the Ministry doesn\\'t have a complete list of all driving schools in the country both Licensed and unlicensed. The public is thus undertaking lessons in schools without guaranteed quality and standards. In addition, from the sample, the Government of Uganda loses UGX 35.4 million shillings every year due to unlicensed driving schools operating in the country.\\n\\n- I noted that Majority driving school owners did not poses and were not using the approved driver learner training materials issued by the Ministry. Many used self- developed materials while others used class B training materials to train drivers for other classes like CI, DI, CE and others. As a result, driving schools in Uganda continue to utilize non-standardized training materials, resulting in non- standardized competence of drivers on the road, which is one of the contributors to the country\\'s high rate of road accidents.\\n\\n- I noted that the Inspector of Vehicle (IOV) centres are not monitored by the Ministry as is required by the regulations. There was no proof of evidence of receipt of IOV\\'s monthly learner driver test reports during the past five years and no documentation proof of formal correspondence between the MoWT and IOV demanding the same. This has led to a lack of certainty regarding whether the IOV tests students who have genuinely received training in driving schools and whether these student drivers have received training from licensed driving schools.\\n\\n- I conducted a System walk through at the Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) railway station offices in Kampala and reviewed that, out of the 6 required documents, 4 documents (competency certificate, medical form, certificate of completion, and proof of enrolment) are not verified before issuance of a driving license.\\n\\n- I noted that 70% of the sampled applicants, had received training from a non- licensed driving school, while 28 out of 94 applicants, (29.8%), had received training from a licensed driving school. 30% (30 out of 100) had serial numbers of Certificates of Competence that did not match with serial numbers issued at IoV, while 50% (50 out of 100) of applicants had serial numbers that were initially given to someone else, hence fraudulent.\\n\\n- 71% (67 out of 95) of the 95 applications with attached medical forms were issued by unlicensed medical professionals, while 5% (5 out of 95) were issued by forgers (those using someone else medical registration number). 15% of the participants (14 out of 95) had not written their names and registration numbers legibly. The MoWT has failed to ensure that the issue of driver\\'s licenses adheres\\n\\n---\\n\\nto the procedures outlined in all applicable rules. This leads to issuance of licenses to incompetent drivers.\\n\\n- I noted that Ministry of Works and Transport sensitization plans lacked specific actions in regard to purpose, media type, roles and responsibilities of officials, particular activity budgets, timetables, and operational technique. Audit further established that while the ministry reported in its yearly performance reports to have carried out all planned campaigns, evidence was only provided for six (6) of twelve (12) planned campaigns of the planned campaigns. Failure to sensitize the public contributes to low compliance with PSV licensing terms and conditions.\\n\\nThere is also lack of coordination with the enforcement Agencies like the traffic police to enforce licensing and standards. According to the Police, they stated that they lacked the database of licensed PSV from the Ministry from which they would crosscheck to enforce compliance.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Works and Transport to;\\n\\n\\uf0fc Develop mechanisms to capture licensed and unlicensed PSVs in Uganda with all of their attributes, process the data, and use it to generate route charts, stages, and timetables.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Develop and distribute monthly updated lists of licensed PSVs to enforcement agencies including urban authorities and Uganda Police. MoWT could explore the use of Mobile App to share data with the various Agencies\\n\\n\\uf0fc Raise public awareness of the annual PSV requirement.\\n\\n\\uf0fc In the short run liaise with the Uganda Police Inspector of Vehicles staff to conduct PSV inspections where it lacks capacity.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Expedite discussions and negotiations with SGS to bridge the quality gaps in inspections of PSVs across the country.  \\n\\uf0fc Undertake a baseline to obtain data and records of all existing driving schools and confirm they have operating licenses, and work with law enforcement to close and prosecute violators.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\uf0fc  \\nDevelop internal controls in the UDLS system to verify the validity of all submitted documentation before issuance of driver’s license.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Appropriately plan and prioritize actions in road safety advocacy and awareness for different players in the Public Service Transport sub-sector so that the sector is better regulated.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAlthough the Ugandan government has made significant efforts to regulate and promote a safe and reliable public road transportation system by improving the efficiency at which driver\\'s licenses are issued among others, there were numerous gaps noted including unlicensed driving schools PSVs and motor cycles, limited and inadequate annual inspections and lack of enforcement as most drivers drive without permits. These challenges have an effect of contributing towards the increased road accidents in Uganda. To ensure completeness, the Ministry of Works and Transport should ensure that PSV registration, licensing, and inspection are automated and integrated with the various other government databases of URA and Uganda Police. Similarly, the training provided by various driving schools should be consistent and monitored to ensure that standards are met. To ensure compliance with regulations and laws, sensitization and enforcement should be strengthened and coordinated with other agencies and local governments.\\n\\n**4.3.7. Value for Money audit of GRID Extension Projects implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency Currently under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for the period 2009 – 2017**\\n\\nBetween 2009 and 2017, REA secured **USD.80Mn** from SIDA, JICA, World Bank, NORAD and the Government of Uganda to implement priority Rural Electrification Projects most of which were part of the sample of projects under review.\\n\\nThe Scope of the audit covered the GRID extension power line projects implemented in the 13 service territories under the various funding programs between the financial years 2013/14 to 2017/18. The GRID Extension power-line projects assessment covered the following;\\n\\n- Completed Grid Projects Implemented by REA since Financial Year 2013/2014 to 2016/17 when RESP II was being implemented\\n\\n- Completed UMEME Cost Shared Lines since 2013/2014 and 2014/15.\\n- Schemes Implemented through Concession Operators\\n\\n- Ongoing Grid Projects under Implementation by REA\\n\\n- Completed Grid Projects Implemented by REA from (2009-2017) Prioritized by Rural Electrification Agency.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn light of the foregoing, I undertook this Value for Money audit to assess whether construction of Grid extension power lines and associated installations implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) was undertaken in accordance with recommended technical standards, designs and specifications; assess the quality and functionality of the completed power-lines and associated installations and its impact on the user communities. I made the following observations;\\n\\nThere have been Positive Economic Impacts realized from constructed GRID Lines, for instance;\\n\\nUrbanization of several trading centres along the power lines constructed, many income-generating activities were initiated by the locals such as maize milling, wielding, salons, juice production thus improving their incomes and way of life and creation of employment opportunities; promoting value addition to the local agricultural products and dairy products; reduction in greenhouse emissions.\\n\\nImproved investment climate in targeted communities; and increase in government revenue.\\n\\nHowever, there are still some performance gaps in operation of rural electrification projects that need to be addressed as summarised below;\\n\\n- I circularized contractors and noted that, REA owed nine (9) firms for works already completed worth USD.28,080,776.53 and UGX.3,350,908,860.\\n\\n- Out of the commissioned lines, UMEME attracted and obtained O&M rights for about 25% for township lines. UEDCL obtained about 60% of the O&M rights leaving the 15% to the other operators.\\n\\n- Audit did not get evidence of any deliberate O&M policies or practices specifically on the preventative maintenance. I was not provided with preventative maintenance plans, nor was there proof of a structured and consistence implementation of basic prudent maintenance practices on the lines.\\n\\n- Although ERA is mandated to issue license to the operators, review and approve the O&M Budgets as well as regulate the operations of these licensee, audit noted minimal supervision by ERA in line with oversight monitoring and Evaluation.\\n\\n- Additionally, in terms of the operating and management costs of power lines, they were deemed high due to a number of factors such as transformers, defective or rotten poles which needed replacement in the shortest of time after the commissioning of these lines. For instance, according to UEDCL data for Kabale – Kisoro – Bunagana Scheme, the annual maintenance cost was at 34.7 billion against 518 billion generated revenues. This translates 6.8% of revenue which is above the 5% threshold requirement.\\n\\n- Several occupation and safety hazards noted during implementation of the GRID power projects. 33kV power lines were constructed to span across roofs\\n\\n---\\n\\nof residential houses in Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere power scheme, Mpanga- Kamwenge-Kahungye-Nkingo.\\n\\n- Audit noted inadequacies in design and construction of GRID power projects; Although normal service conditions and or best practice requires that 33KV extensions should originate from substations (service bays/Bus Bars) audit noted that for most of the projects implemented by REA, MV extensions were tapped from existing feeders implying that the newly implemented MV extension automatically inherits the challenges of the backbone and vice versa. Examples were noted in Kabale-Kisoro, Gulu-Acholibur, Masindi- Waki- Buliisa, Opuyo-Moroto, Ibanda- Kazo- Rushere, Gulu-Adjumani-Moyo.\\n\\n- Voltage drops were also witnessed during field inspections for all extensions beyond 100km that did not originate from the substation. High voltage drops, below the permissible level can result in increased system maintenance costs, a decrease in the safety and performance of the network as well as reduced expected lifetime of the equipment.\\n\\n- In line with contractual requirements, wooden poles are expected to last up to 20years. Document review and field inspections noted that poles supplied on some projects as; Masindi- Waki-Buliisa, Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere, Gulu-Acholibur, Kitgum-Palabek, Ayer-Kamdini among others, failed due to rotting, insect Infestation, pole burning and breaking. No document was availed to ascertain that quality control procedures were followed. Furthermore, no effort was recognized from REA that the defective wooden poles are claimed back from the respective pole suppliers.\\n\\nI have made the following recommendations to the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) which has now inherited the functions of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under which the GRID power projects were implemented and recommended that;\\n\\n\\uf0fc The outstanding amounts owed to contractor’s firms are paid for works that are completed and verified to avoid incurring penalties on delayed payments\\n\\n\\uf0fc To continuously address Environmental and social issues in contracts and their implementation and ensure that all contracts for implementation of GRID power projects make it mandatory for the implementation firms to prepare environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) reports in addition to resultant Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement Action Management Plans (RAMPs).\\n\\n---\\n\\nbe monitored and controlled unlike wooden poles whose quality is determined by many factors from the time they are planted, harvested, treated at the factory, and eventually transported to site.\\n\\n\\uf0fc MEMD strengthens project management, monitoring and supervision arrangements for GRID power projects to ensure that all GRID projects are implemented within project time lines, indicated in the approved activity work programs and contracts.\\n\\n\\uf0fc For Power schemes implemented through concession operators, MEMD ensures that:\\n\\no  \\nThe licensed firms operating under concession agreements undertake effective operation and maintenance activities in respect of replacing all non-function GRID equipment as blown fuses, surge arrestors, replacing broken poles, faulty transformers to keep the power lines functional  \\no  \\nMEMD closely monitors and supervises the licensees to establish that they comply with the license terms and conditions and fulfil the objective of increasing access to electricity.\\n\\n**4.3.8. A value for money audit report on management of senior citizens grant by the expanding social protection programme under the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD) in partnership with the British Department for International Development (DFID) and Irish Aid is implementing the Expanding Social Protection Programme (ESPP) whose aim is to provide cash transfers to the poorest and most vulnerable people in Uganda.\\n\\nSocial Protection is recognized world over as a critical element of national development strategies. The Uganda Vision 2040 envisages a social protection system that includes a universal pension for older persons. In addition, the National Development Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 highlights social protection as a key strategy for transforming Uganda to a modern and prosperous middle-income country.\\n\\nIn 2021, Uganda’s projected total population was 42,885,900 persons out of which, the proportion of older persons (>60yrs) was 1,715,436 (4%). About 32% (548,940) of all older persons are reported not working and not looking for work.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt is against this background that the I undertook a Performance audit on the management of the Social Assistance Grant for Empowerment (SAGE). The following key findings and recommendations were noted;\\n\\n- The programme achieved key success in some areas, whereby all 146 districts in the country were brought on board in the financial year 2019/2020, resulting from the government commitment made in November, 2018.\\n\\n- By 20th December 2022, 439,131 older persons (262,448 females and 176,673 male) had been paid, of which 128,016 were registered in the national rollout programme.\\n\\n- Furthermore, the Grant had helped beneficiaries to sustain their livelihoods and access basic needs of life. The bulk of the beneficiaries indicated that they used the Grant to buy food (88.9%), medical care (57.8%), hygiene and livestock, both at (27%).\\n\\n- For the period under review, out of the 285,778 targeted beneficiaries only 226,195 beneficiaries were verified by PMU, leaving 59,583 beneficiaries unverified due to lack of national IDs and having errors in their birth dates.\\n\\n- Out of 226,195 beneficiaries verified in the three years under review only 159,282 were registered by PMU leaving 66,913 unregistered.\\n- Out of 212,711 verified and registered beneficiaries, 4,623 eligible persons of 80 years and above had neither been enrolled nor issued account numbers by the payment service provider. Whereas the PSP was required to communicate to MoGLSD reasons for delays in enrolment of the registered beneficiaries, this was not done, contrary to the service level agreement.\\n\\n- 9,799 beneficiaries (2,297 persons without National Identity Cards, 2,836 persons with NINs and 4,666 infirm beneficiaries) who were originally with Post Bank Uganda Limited had not been enrolled with CERUDEB\\n\\n- Comparison of SAGE MIS data with CERUDEB beneficiary data revealed that seven thousand three hundred eighty-four (7,384) out of thirty-two thousand one hundred thirty four (32,134) alternative recipients were registered in SAGE MIS but missing in the CERUDEB data. Similarly, inspection of pay points revealed that the PSP’s payment system/software used in the field to make payments does not recognize alternative recipients.\\n\\n- Beneficiaries were paid quarterly while some would receive their grants after six months contrary to the bi-monthly payments provided for in the implementation guidelines.\\n\\n- Out of 10 RTSUs, Mbarara RTSU had 4,904 beneficiaries who were issued bank accounts in the period between November 2021 and March 2022 but had not received cash on their accounts at the time of audit in October, 2022.\\n\\n- In all the 10 districts visited, it was noted that payrolls were not used for roll calling during payment contrary to SCG implementation guidelines, 2019 which require payrolls to be used for confirming beneficiaries due for payment,\\n\\n---\\n\\namounts credited on their accounts for a given payment cycle and as calling lists at the pay point.\\n\\n- Information of both active and inactive bank accounts provided by the PSP revealed 3,344 inactive bank accounts as at October 2022 with bank balances totalling to UGX.740Mn\\n\\nI have made the following recommendations:\\n\\n\\uf0fc MoGLSD should liaise with NIRA to ensure that all potential beneficiaries get National IDs which is a requirement for them to be targeted.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU through RTSUs should ensure that verification plans are availed to the districts timely for proper organisation of the verification exercise.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU should ensure adequate training of district local government stakeholders is carried out to enable proper mobilisation during verification.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU should develop guidelines on verification of relocated beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\uf0fc The PMU is advised to prioritize stakeholder trainings and sensitization so as to impact knowledge and skills on how to mobilize potential beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU should consider adjusting the 10Km radius by identifying the accessible service centres/points within the reach of the beneficiaries in consultation with the Payment Service Provider, respective Local Governments and the older person’s councils.\\n\\n\\uf0fc The PMU should enforce the penalty provided in the service level agreement for delays in beneficiary account opening.\\n\\n\\uf0fc The PMU should ensure that the PSP uses proper electronic gadgets for capturing the beneficiary bio-data including capture of photos and synchronization of the data.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU should liaise with NIRA to ensure that all previous Post Bank beneficiaries who are not enrolled with CERUDEB due to lack of national IDs are supported to obtain them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU through the local structures should ensure that all deaths that occur before the payments cycles are reported and updated.\\n\\n\\uf0fc PMU through the local government structures should ensure that in case of reported death, the next of kin is supported to claim the funds in a timely manner\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe program did not target all the eligible elderly persons above 80 years due to among others lack of national IDs or errors in the National IDs resulting in so many Senior citizens missing out from the benefits of the program. The program to a large extent verified and registered most of the targeted beneficiaries; however, more strategies need to be put in place to ensure 100% verification and registration of the targeted groups. There were notable challenges with the enrolment of the beneficiaries due to lack of national IDs and inefficiencies with the bank electronic gadgets that were impeding the registration of some beneficiaries. There were also challenges of data migration from Post bank to CERUDEB and lack of national IDs by alternative recipients and delays in sharing of bank accounts by the PSP with PMU among others affecting payment of the beneficiaries.\\n\\nDespite the strategies Government has put in place to ensure sustainability of the SCG program, there is need for Government to demonstrate its commitment by clearing the accumulated arrears owed to the senior citizens. The government also needs to strengthen its systems in terms of creating awareness and building capacity of the Local governments so that they can take ownership of the program.\\n\\n**4.3.9. A value for money audit draft report on the management of electricity connections under rural electrification programme (MEMD)**\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda established the Electricity Connections Policy (ECP) 2018 ‐2027 with the primary objective of increasing electricity access and providing clean energy for Ugandans. The ECP is implemented under government’s Rural Electrification Programme (REP) in line with the Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan (RESP II) 2013-2022. The goal of the programme is to achieve 26% rural access target by 2022 and 60% level of access to electricity for Uganda by 2027.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt’s against this background that I conducted a Value for Money Audit on the management of the connections under the REP as these are instrumental in improving the electricity access and the attainment of social-economic transformation of the country.\\n\\nThe following key findings and recommendations were noted;\\n\\n- Analysis of UMEME’s connections under the ECP programme revealed that the average connections made during the years under review had improved significantly from 825 per day in 2018 to 1,200 per day in 2020 (just before COVID Period) representing an increment of 45%.\\n\\n- The verification exercise revealed that approximately 40% of the households visited were using power for commercial purposes such as welding, salons, retail shops; grinding maize, among others while, 60% of the households used power for domestic consumption such as lighting, viewing television, among others. This has improved the socio-economic status of the society.\\n\\n- Through interview and document review of the work plans submitted to Rural Electrification Programme (REP), Service Providers (SPs) projected to connect only 567,121 households in the target years whereas the Rural Electrification Programme under the ECP had a planned target of 900,000 connections. This implies that the submitted plans were below the programme target by 332,879, which is 37% short of the ECP targets indicated above.\\n- Further analysis of the achievements of target connections using the ECP database revealed that the service providers made a total of only 252,491 (includes unverified figures by IVA) connections in the three years under review, representing 45% of the projected total targets of 567,121 by SPs. This would, however, represent 28% of the Programme target over the 3 years under review.\\n\\n- In the period under review, Government planned to spend a sum of UGX.123.3Bn, but it only released UGX.61.0Bn, thus representing a budget performance of only 49%. This affected the attainment of the Programme targeted connections. Further analysis indicated under absorption of the released funds whereby only UGX.51.5 billion was utilized indicating utilization level of only 84% of government funds.\\n\\n- Utilization of donor funding was equally very low whereby out of total available funds of USD.34.5Mn from WB-IDA and AfDB, only USD.22.9Mn (66%) was utilized. Similarly, out of EUR.20.7Mn available from KfW, GIZ, AFD, and AfDB, only EUR.19.2Mn (69%) was utilized. This constitutes an average utilization to 67.5% over the period under review.\\n\\n- I noted challenges in procurement management whereby instances of delivery of incomplete sets of connection materials were noted; delayed procurements with an average delay of; excessive procurement of certain connection materials; stock outs on some materials; and unutilized materials in the stores.\\n\\n- I noted instances of uncoordinated consumer awareness activities by stakeholders in an effort to market and mobilize for increased consumer connections. Service Providers solely carried out consumer awareness through outreach programs, radio and TV talk shows without the involvement of\\n\\n---\\n\\nProgramme management. As a result, the envisaged awareness objective of the ECP was not achieved and consumers fell victim of unscrupulous wiremen who ended up charging them for connections which were supposed to be free or overpaying on some subsidized services of the programme.\\n\\n- A review of a sample of 19 (30%) out of 61 verification reports submitted by the connections department relating to 5 SPs revealed that none were submitted on time. There was a delay in verifications by an average of 5.75 months (23 weeks) contrary to the minimum requirement of 3 months. The longest average delay of 9.75 months (39 weeks) was noted in verifying WENRECO’s connections.\\n\\nI have made the following recommendations\\n\\n\\uf0fc Programme management should review the Programme requirements to ascertain whether the envisaged programme resources can still meet the programme objectives and engage relevant stakeholder to ensure that the required resources are provided.\\n\\n\\uf0fc MEMD should ensure that the Service Providers that undertake Programme implementation submit all the required plans which should be reviewed and approved by the Programme management; this will further facilitate programme monitoring and enable development of corrective measures in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Programme management should review the SPs connection targets to ensure that they are aligned to the Programme targets, and strategies should be developed for the attainment of those targets.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Government should prioritize funding of the Programme as planned and envisaged in the Electricity Connections Policy. The Government commitment should be followed through in the annual budgets of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals development.\\n\\n\\uf0fc MEMD and Programme management should ensure donors funds are utilized in accordance with the agreed covenants in the funds agreements, and should iron out all bottlenecks that lead to low absorption of donor funding.\\n\\n---\\n\\nawareness, for the achievement of the objectives of the Programme as envisaged in the ECP.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe status of progress under the ECP programme indicated significant improvements in average connections made during the years 2018 to 2020, with a number of households using electricity for commercial purposes and domestic consumption. That notwithstanding, the ECP has been faced with a number challenges in the implementation of key activities fundamental to the achievement of Programme objectives. Notably, there was failure to meet the target electricity connections due to inadequate planning for connections, non-submission of work plans and inadequate funding. Additionally, there were inadequacies in the procurement and contract management processes, inadequate marketing and consumer awareness, delays in the verification and subsidy re-imbursements and inadequate reporting.\\n\\nThe Government has secured World Bank funding under the Electricity Access Scale Up Project which is expected to bridge the financing gap experienced under the ECP, and result into more electricity connections.\\n\\n**4.3.10. Value for Money Audit on Preparedness by OPM to respond to disasters**\\n\\nDisaster risk is increasingly of global concern and its impact and actions in one region can have an impact on another with Uganda being no exception. The entity mandated to handle disasters in Uganda is Office or the Prime Minister and the Local Governments.\\n\\nArising from this background, I conducted a performance study to assess whether the Office of the Prime Minister was adequately prepared to respond to disasters.\\n\\nThe following observations were noted from the study;\\n\\n- OPM had challenges in early detection and response to disaster warnings. Some of the disasters were detected early but very little was done to adequately prepare for them. In other cases, disasters happened without early detection. It was observed that comprehensive and routine risk profiling and mapping of the disaster-prone areas was still a challenge and this was worsened by the absence of functional and reliable early warning systems.\\n\\n- The immediate response to disasters by OPM was not timely and usually uncoordinated. This was because the Disaster Management Committees were not fully functional at the districts, sub county and village level which were the closest structures for response. In addition, it was observed that there were weaknesses in the existing coordination arrangements between OPM and other players.\\n\\n- OPM faced challenges in search and rescue in the event of the occurrence of disaster incidents. Property and sometimes lives were lost or remained un- recovered after incidents of disasters. This was attributed to the lack of rescue equipment and inadequately trained response teams.\\n\\n- OPM had challenges in post disaster handling and resettlement due to inadequate planning for post disaster resettlement. In addition, the procurement of land for\\n\\n---\\n\\nresettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) remained one of the unfunded priorities in the Department’s work plan.\\n\\n- Gaps were noted in the existing legal framework as evidenced by absence of the National Disaster Preparedness and Management Act and Standard Operating Procedures for management of disasters. This activity was not prioritized by management.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn order to address the challenges identified, OPM should prioritize risk profiling and mapping, operationalize the Disaster Risk Management plan which provides for funding for disaster management, recruitment of personnel, develop strategies on ensuring that there are functional early warning systems especially in the disaster-prone districts, develop a maintenance plan for the existing equipment as well as enhance coordination with other stakeholders.\\n\\n**4.3.11. Value for Money Audit on Management of Revenue by KCCA**\\n\\nArticle 152 of the Constitution mandates Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) to levy, charge, collect and appropriate fees and taxes.\\n\\nI undertook an audit to assess the performance of the Authority in regard to revenue management and below are a summary of my observations;\\n\\n- The revenue targets used by the Authority were not reflective of the actual capacity of the Authority to mobilise revenue. The Authority uses revenue budgets set by MoFPED which are usually lower than the Authority’s internally generated targets. This hinders the authority from achieving its revenue collection potential.\\n\\n- The Authority performed below the set revenue targets for all the sampled revenue sources. Performance of the various sources was below the set targets with shortfalls ranging between 4% and 17% of the target. The underperformance was attributed to understaffing at the revenue directorate, insufficient transport resources for revenue mobilization, and gaps within the existing legal framework.\\n\\n- The Authority’s revenue arrears have continued to increase over the years. The arrears increased by 86% in the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 82% between FY 2019/2020 to FY 2021/2022. I noted that the annual recovery targets set by the Authority were low compared to the receivables and even the low targets were not met.\\n\\n---\\n\\nplans, monitoring of activities and conducting of performance evaluations of implemented activities in respective entities.\\n\\nThis study assessed whether Planning Units had prepared and monitored the implementation of approved development plans.\\n\\nBelow are some of the highlights of the study;\\n\\n- I noted that 111 MDAs out of the 145 MDAs representing 77% had their development plans approved as aligned to NDP III. A total of 83 out of the 176 LGs representing 47% had their development plans approved as aligned to NDP III. The failure to have development plans that are aligned to the NDP III was attributed to late approval of the NDP-III and late trainings for planners on how to prepare well aligned plans. Failure to have well aligned plans will affect the achievement of the NDP-III objectives.\\n\\n- Planning units do not undertake consultations with stakeholders during the process of preparing development plans. The only engagements that are close to the consultations envisioned in the regulations are the budget conferences that are conducted in the year preceding the preparation of the development plans. In the case of MDAs, investments priorities were determined based on aspirations of top management. This was attributed to lack of clarity by the planners on the requirement to undertake detailed consultations at the time of preparing development plans. This resulted into failure to prioritize citizen needs.\\n\\n- There were challenges in aligning entity annual plans to the approved development plans. A sample of ninety (90) activities randomly selected from the annual plans of the sampled entities were traced to the approved development plans and it was observed that only thirty-three (33) activities representing 37% of the total population sampled could be traced back to the approved development plans. The misalignment of the annual budgets and development plans negates the purpose of preparing development budgets since annual priorities are not set from these development plans.\\n\\n- The study noted that the current monitoring undertaken by the planning entities was un-satisfactory. The monitoring focuses usually on a few capital projects being implemented by the entities and is not regularly and consistently undertaken. In addition, none of the entities had clearly defined monitoring plans and none had undertaken performance evaluations of prior and current development plans. This was attributed to;\\n\\n---\\n\\n**4.3.13. Value for Money Audit on Production of Agricultural Statistics by Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF)**\\n\\nAgriculture is a key driver of Uganda’s economy accounting for over 80% of employment, half (50%) of all exports, and one-quarter (25%) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The sector, therefore, requires timely, reliable, and good statistics to enable effective planning, monitoring and evaluation as well as investment, and reporting of business activities. To achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) launched the Agricultural Sector Data Centre and National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) in 2015 to harmonise the production of agricultural statistics in Uganda. The System aimed to ensure that data related to the agricultural sector is accurate, timely, consistent, disaggregated and accessible to facilitate planning and decision-making in MAAIF, other Ministries, Departments and Agencies, and Local Governments as well as facilitating private sector investment decisions.\\n\\nThis audit sought to assess whether Agricultural Statistics produced by MAAIF through the National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) are Relevant, Accurate, Reliable, Timely and Accessible for proper planning, decision making and policy formulation. Below are key findings and conclusions.\\n\\n**i.** Status of Implementation of the National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) Project**\\n\\na)  \\nComponent 1: National Agricultural Data Centre\\n\\n**Underutilized data Centre:** It was noted that the data centre was not being utilized in the processing and analysis of data from MDAs, LGs, and MAAIF departments on a day-to-day basis as envisaged at project inception despite being fully equipped. The Ministry, therefore, did not produce any monthly or seasonal statistical products for the duration of operation of the data centre, that is, 2015/16 to 2021/22.\\n\\n**Non-functional TEEAL library:** The TEEAL Library was not functional and could not be accessed by potential users. This was attributed to the expiry of the software license which the Ministry had not renewed following its initial purchase. Whereas the TEEAL library which was run by Cornell University was discontinued in 2018, MAAIF did not seek alternative agricultural libraries to support agricultural research and access to statistical resources. This deprives users of vital information that could be utilized for research, planning, and decision-making.\\n\\n---\\n\\nmembers to the data centre and as such the data centre had remained idle over the period 2020/21-2021/22.\\n\\n**Data and information transfer protocols:** Through system inspection and interviews, it was noted that the Agricultural Statistics Division failed to establish data and information transfer protocols which limited the flow of data between the various institutions and the data centre. It was attributed to the inadequate coordination between MAAIF and the respective MDA’s.\\n\\nc)  \\nComponent 3: Routine Agricultural Administrative Data Reporting System (RAADRS)\\n\\nIt was noted that the Division had conducted training of agricultural extension workers in 24 out of the 112 districts in the country as of FY 2017/18 citing limited funding. However, the audit observed that UGX 1.95Bn of NFASS funds that would have otherwise been used to train extension staff in all the districts were diverted to the Joint Agricultural Sector Annual Review (JASAR) between 2016/17-2019/20.  \\nd) NFASS Pilot study\\n\\n**Data collection from the Sampled Farmers:** A pilot study was undertaken without pre-testing the enterprise data collection tools. Additionally, it was noted that, data collected with the enterprise tools in 2019/20 was uploaded to the system (back end) however, at the time of the audit, the data was still in its raw form, not validated, and therefore not analysed. As a result, the Routine data collection from farmers has not taken off.\\n\\n**Data quality on NFASS:** It was noted that the data presented on the NFASS website in form of graphs and figures lack attributes of good statistics presentation such as completeness, comprehensiveness, interpretability, coherence and comparability.\\n\\n**ii.** Accuracy and Reliability of Agricultural Statistics Produced by the NFASS**\\n\\na) **Validation of source data, intermediate results and statistical outputs:** The Audit noted that the statisticians at the Ministry had not maintained an audit trail of any changes that were made to the data during the data processing. Interviews with the DPOs further revealed that they were not involved in the validation of data because it was collected using CAPI and submitted directly to MAAIF.\\n\\n---\\n\\nsubsequently piloted the data collection tools in 5 districts in 2019, the results of this exercise had not been published by the time of the audit.\\n\\nThe audit noted that the Agricultural Sector Statistics Committee (ASSC) held two (2) coordination meetings, out of a possible Twelve (12). It was also noted that in FY 2018/19, only three (3) of the seven (7) semi-autonomous agencies attended the meetings, while in FY 2020/21, four (4) of the Seven (7) semi-autonomous agencies attended the meeting.\\n\\n**iv. To ascertain whether the statistics produced and disseminated by the NFASS meet the current and/or emerging needs of stakeholders and users of agricultural statistics.**\\n\\na) **Stakeholder Consultation.** The audit noted that key stakeholders like the farmers under the Uganda National Farmers’ Federation, Uganda Meteorological Authority, Uganda Revenue Authority, Bank of Uganda among others were not consulted.  \\nb) **Emerging needs of Stakeholders.** Audit observed that the Ministry generated only production data for 17 key commodities but excluded market and weather data and analysis which is considered key information to support farm production and marketing.\\n\\nc) Dissemination of Agricultural Statistics\\n\\n- **Lack of an Agricultural Statistics Dissemination Strategy.** The MAAIF MPS for FY 2015/16, stated as part of prior year achievements (2014/15), that a draft statistics dissemination strategy had been developed. However, MAAIF did not avail the draft and/or the approved statistics dissemination strategy for audit. As a result, there is no guidance provided by the ministry to agencies producing agricultural statistics.\\n\\n- **Limited dissemination mechanisms.** I noted that MAAIF and sector agencies disseminate statistics through the MAAIF statistical abstract and also through their respective websites for access by the different stakeholders. However, only 5 % of the people in rural areas and 21% of the people in urban areas have access to the internet. In addition, only 13% of persons aged 15 years and above were aware of any or some Government online services available irrespective of whether they had used the internet or not.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMinistry Should further prioritise committee meetings and ensure the attendance of all committee members.  \\n\\uf0fc Develop data and information transfer protocol between databases of the key stakeholder institutions such as CDO, DDA, UCDA, NAGRI/DB, and NARO to the NFASS system\\n\\n\\uf0fc Ensure that funds are allocated to activities that are aligned with their respective outcomes.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Streamline the process of validation to allow for data validation at the districts by Extension workers and DPOs so that errors in the data can be identified and addressed as and when they arise. Prioritise assessments of data demand from farmers and other key stakeholders to ensure that statistical products produced by MAAIF meet the existing and emerging demands of users.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Finalise the statistics dissemination strategy so as to provide regularised and harmonised channels through which agricultural information is delivered to all key users of agricultural statistics.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe project which was established to set up the NFASS system did not meet all its objectives. This is because the data centre which was established to enable the Agricultural Planning Department to become a central resource for quality and timely agricultural information had not been fully utilised since it was set up in 2015. Furthermore, the system had not been linked to other agricultural data-producing MDAs such as UCDA, CDO, DDA, NARO, and District Local Governments. As a result, MAAIF had not produced monthly, seasonal and annual agricultural statistical products such as Production data, Market data, weather/climate data, and soil quality maps in different regions for the different commodities. MAAIF currently produces only one annual product, that is, the Statistical Abstract. The lack of timely, accurate and relevant agricultural statistics deprives stakeholders of the information they need for proper planning and decision-making.\\n\\n**4.3.14.

Follow-up Audit Report on the Status of Implementation of Audit Recommendations on the Value for Money Audit on the Management of Wildlife Conservation by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA)**\\n\\nIn March 2011, the Office of the Auditor General issued a report on the Management of Wildlife Conservation by the Uganda Wildlife Authority and submitted the report to Parliament. Key issues noted and recommendations made related to Research and Monitoring in Conservation Management, Conservation and Natural Resource Management, Staff welfare and Re-introduction and introduction of extinct species among others.\\n\\nThe Office of the Auditor General (OAG) decided to undertake a follow-up of the 2011 audit, aware that the extent to which the Authority addressed the identified performance gaps would lead to better Management of Wildlife Conservation in Uganda.\\n\\nThe previous audit covered three (3) financial years (FY) starting from 2008/2009 to 2010/2011. This included selected conservation areas and focused on the management of wildlife conservation by Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) with the aim of ascertaining whether UWA was managing conservation in protected areas, maintaining park infrastructure and collaborating with other stakeholders in the conservation of wildlife for the benefit of the people of Uganda. The follow-up thus evaluated progress made in implementing audit recommendations from 2011 to-date.\\n\\n**Summary of Status of Implementation of Auditor General’s Findings and Recommendations of the Previous Audit Report and Actions taken by UWA**\\n\\nIt was noted that UWA had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, resulting in improved Management of Wildlife Conservation in Uganda. Out of the 24 key audit recommendations made in the Auditor General’s report of 2011,\\n\\n- 13 (54%) were fully implemented;\\n- 8 (33%) were partially implemented while ;\\n- 3 (13%) were not implemented by UWA.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Figure 1: Summarised status of implementation of audit recommendations** **Not Implemented** 13%**\\n\\n\\n\\n**Fully** **Partially** Implemented** **Implmented**  \\n**54%** 33%**\\n\\n**Source:** OAG analysis of UWA responses and supporting documentation.\\n\\nSpecifically, it was noted that following the 2011 audit, although UWA management had not implemented **3 (13%)** audit recommendations; good progress had been registered by UWA in Management of Wildlife Conservation in Uganda with **13 (54%)** recommendations fully implemented and **8 (33%)** partially implemented, the noted key progress included the following;\\n\\n- The Wildlife Policy 2014 has been reviewed and approved with the Wildlife Act 2019 enacted and the Wildlife Research and Training Institute is now operational.\\n\\n- Integration of IT systems such as Earth Ranger and SMART in Wildlife Conservation Management\\n\\n- The Ranger force is now well equipped with more than I set of complete uniforms.\\n\\n- UWA staff medical scheme has been reviewed and now All UWA staff have medical insurance cover.\\n\\n- The Procurement process for goods, services and works have greatly imporved with better compliance with the PPDA rules and regulations.\\n\\n- The UWA Policy for Animal Translocation has been developed.\\n\\n- The Rhino Specific strategy for reintroduction and management of Rhinos in Uganda has been developed and is under implementation.\\n\\n- UWA has developed and is implementing strategies aimed at securing Protected Areas (PAs) through use of electric fences, collars to tag wildlife and ICT solutions among others and these have yielded positive results.\\n\\n- The recruitment of key technical staff and strengthening of the capacity of Rangers in UWA Protected Areas (PAs) is a continuous activity\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table 77: Detailed status of implementation of OAG recommendations** SN Audit recommendation Status of Audit comment on resolving implementation previous condition/problem by**\\n\\n**Research and monitoring**\\n\\n**Data for wildlife resources and biodiversity** **management** 1** UWA should prioritize her Partially\\n\\n**the actions of uwa management**\\n\\nUWA has undertaken many population survey and Implemented surveys over the years ecological monitoring  \\nactivities through improved  \\nbudgeting and resource  \\nallocation mechanism.  \\n**2**  \\nUWA should mobilize and Implemented  \\nencourage volunteers and  \\nstudents who are willing to  \\nconduct surveys into the  \\nactivities of wildlife\\n\\ndespite their limitations, thus having limited coverage.\\n\\nMany students are conducting research in the various PA despite their limited supervision and incorporation of UWA research priorities in management. their research. **Wildlife Research for Conservation Management**\\n\\n**3** UWA should strengthen the Partially capacity of the Research Implemented and Monitoring unit so as to  \\nenable it adequately  \\nmonitor and promote its  \\nplanned research activities.\\n\\nUWA designated research officers in the various PA’s despite their lack of specific PA research plans and monitoring of various UWA interventions.  \\n**4** The process of reviewing Implemented The Wildlife policy was the Wildlife Policy should be  \\nexpedited to enable the  \\ncreation of the wildlife  \\nResearch and Training  \\nInstitute.\\n\\n**Conservation and natural resource management 5** UWA should equip the Partially planning unit to enable it to Implemented develop fire management  \\nplans and empower PAs for\\n\\nreviewed and the Research Institute is operational and sending research students to the PA’s.\\n\\nPlanning Units have been equipped, fire management plans are prepared but are yet to be reviewed for their their implementation. effectiveness and\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **SN Audit recommendation Status implementation** **of Audit comment on resolving previous condition/problem by the actions of uwa management** |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **9** | UWA should review its staff | Implemented | Medical insurance is now |  \\n|| medical scheme and |<| being provided to all UWA |  \\n|^| strategies to ensure that all |<| staff across all levels. |  \\n|^| staff benefit, including |<|<|  \\n|^| rangers. |<|<|  \\n| **Re-introduction of Extinct Species** |<|<|<|  \\n| **10** | UWA should follow policies | Implemented | Polices for animal |  \\n|| and guidelines for wildlife |<| translocation have been |  \\n|^| shipment, translocation and |<| developed and implemented |  \\n|^| reintroduction and should |<| across the PA’s and these |  \\n|^| be actively involved in the |<| have proved to be very |  \\n|^| implementation of these |<| effective over the years. |  \\n|^| policies. |<|<|  \\n| **11**  UWA should actively involve itself in the management of the Rhino Fund Uganda as required by the signed memorandum  of understanding.

Follow-Up Report on the Status of Implementation of Audit Recommendations on the Value for Money Audit on the Regulation of the Construction Sector by the Ministry of Works and Transport**\\n\\nIn December 2015, the Office of the Auditor General issued a report on the Regulation of the Construction Sector by the Ministry of Works and Transport and submitted the report to Parliament. Key issues noted and recommendations made in the said report related to Development of policies, laws and standards, Strengthening and Support to Regulatory and Professional Bodies, Dissemination of policies, laws and standards, Research on Construction Materials, Monitoring of Compliance to Construction standards and coordination of stakeholders among others.\\n\\nThe Office of the Auditor General (OAG) decided to undertake a follow-up of the 2015 audit given that the extent to which the Ministry addressed the issues raised would have a bearing on improvements in enforcement of best practices in the construction industry. Further, recommendations were then made with the aim of addressing outstanding issues noted.\\n\\n**Scope of the follow-up**\\n\\nThe previous audit covered three (3) financial years (FY) starting from 2012/13 to 2014/15. The follow-up thus evaluated progress made by Ministry of Works and Transport coordination with Key stakeholders in implementing audit recommendations from 2015 to-date.\\n\\n**Summary of Auditor General’s findings and recommendations of previous audit report and actions taken by Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT)**\\n\\nThe Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, resulting in improvements in oversight of the Construction Sector in Uganda. Out of the 10 key audit recommendations made in the AG’s report of 2015,\\n\\n- 3 (30%) were fully implemented;\\n- 4 (40%) were partially implemented and\\n- 3 (30%) of the recommendations were not implemented\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Figure V: Summary of status of implementation of audit recommendations**\\n\\n\\n\\n**Not Implemented** Fully Implemented** **30%** 30%**\\n\\n**Partially Implmented 40%**\\n\\n**Source:** OAG analysis of MoWT responses and supporting documentation\\n\\nSpecifically noted was following the 2015 audit, although MoWT management had not implemented 3 audit recommendations, good progress had been made by MOWT towards Regulation of the Construction Sector by MoWT, with 3 recommendations fully implemented and 4 partially implemented. The noted progress included the following;\\n\\n- The Building Codes and Regulations were developed and have been operationalised since 2 nd October 2018.\\n- The National Building Review Board was inaugurated on 2 nd October, 2018 and the Secretariat was established in March 2019.\\n- The Ministry updated and developed policies, manuals, specifications and guidelines such as the Road Tolling Policy of 2017, Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) Design, Construction, and Operation Manual, Low Volume Sealed Roads Manual (2018) and Specifications, Roads Act (2019). The specifications for Roads & Bridges Works and Urban Roads Manual are under review.\\n- The Ministry increased budgetary support to regulatory and professional bodies associated with regulation of the Construction sector.\\n- The Ministry filled regulatory gaps like the establishment of Construction Industry Development Committee which has representation from all professional bodies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **Status** of implementation as reported by mowt** **Audit comment on** **resolving** previous condition/problem by actions of management** **S/N Audit recommendation** |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **2** | The Ministry should prioritize | Partially | No |  \\n|| finalization of the UCICO bill. | Implemented |<|  \\n|^||<|<|  \\n| Implemented Whereas, the building regulations and code were developed, They were not widely disseminated.

Value for money audit report on management of piped water systems in rural areas of uganda by Ministry of Water and Environment**\\n\\nAccess to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right, and is an important health and development aspect at global, national, regional and local levels. Access to water is described as availability of at least 20 liters of water per person per day within a radius of one kilometer of the user’s dwelling. One of the strategic objectives of the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE) is to increase water supply coverage in the rural areas while ensuring equity by providing at least each village with one safe and clean water source, and where it is technically feasible with piped water options.\\n\\n---\\n\\nselected piped water schemes in rural areas in a timely and effective manner. The audit covered four financial years from 2018/19 to 2021/22 whereby 3 projects covering 18 water schemes out 6 projects with 23 water schemes were assessed.\\n\\nBelow is a summary of key findings and recommendations.\\n\\nDuring the period under review of 2018/19 to 2021/2022, the Ministry of Water and Environment implemented a total of six projects with 23 piped water schemes. Of these 23 schemes, 11 were completed while 12 were still ongoing. In addition, The Ministry’s access to safe rural water stagnated at 68% for three out of the four years under review ended 30 th June 2022. The stagnation was attributed to the growing population and the inability to provide infrastructure to meet the growing water demand. The following were noted;\\n\\n- There was no evidence of review of the plans and feasibility studies before commencement of construction works. Planning documents relating to the three (3) projects with eighteen (18) water schemes selected for audit were not availed to the audit team for review.\\n\\n- Despite the absence of the planning documents, indications of inadequate planning were revealed through the review of implementation documentation. The significant variances in the actual and targeted number of beneficiaries, occasioned by the delayed plan approvals before actual implementation of the schemes, were noted. This further indicated that there was no project re-appraisal undertaken by management to validate the targets. As a result, there were variations in contract works and contract prices amounting to UGX 14.358 billion.\\n\\n- There were delays in implementation of water supply schemes. Fourteen (77.7%) of the eighteen schemes were delayed and had extensions of up to four years. The delay in implementation was attributed to the delays in commencement of construction works by contractors of up to 5 months, delayed payment to contractors for certified works by over four months, affecting their cash flows; internal borrowing of project funds of up to UGX5.7 Billion to implement activities outside the approved work plans; and delays resulting from the restrictions under the Covid19 Pandemic. Furthermore, the delays were a result of the delays in acquisition of project land, among others. The overall project delays have since resulted into increased interest costs charged by supervisors and contractors of up to UGX 3.2 billion.\\n\\n- There were inadequacies in regard to the monitoring and evaluation undertaken by the monitoring and evaluation unit at the Ministry of Water and Environment. The M&E activities were not frequently undertaken, actual monitoring visits were not undertaken as planned, and absence of contract management reports for management decision making purposes. Consequently, the use of substandard materials/equipment to implement the piped water schemes by contractors were not timely identified; and delays by the contractors to implement monitoring recommendations and supervisory instructions were not followed. These affected the overall quality of service delivered to the citizens and are likely hinder overall project sustainability.\\n\\n- The annual national average of the functionality of water supply systems averaged at 83.5% over the four years. Whereas this was a good measure of performance,\\n\\n---\\n\\nthe incidents of limited functionality on some water schemes were noted which resulted from inadequacies in the maintenance and repairs of the schemes, occasioned by limitations in revenue collection, inadequate actual water connections in relation to the planned targets, vandalism of water system infrastructure, and affordability of the water services by the communities, among others. These challenges if not addressed are likely to hinder the sustainability of the schemes and the overall failure by Government to attain the desired levels of quality water accessibility to the citizens in the rural areas.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Water and Environment should;\\n\\n\\uf0fc Ensure that filing of planning and other related records is properly managed by considering going digital to enable easy accessibility to those records to foster assessment or project appraisals at any level when required.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Ensure adequate reviews of projects plans or project re-appraisals are undertaken before commencement of projects which take longer to commence following long lead times before accessing funding. In addition, payments to contractors should be synchronized with planned cash flow releases for the schemes implementation.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Assess the viability of the initial feasibility studies and project designs and make timely revisions where necessary. This would reduce on the increased project costs resulting from delays and variations taking place during project implementation.\\n\\n\\uf0fc  \\nUndertake adequate monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the water supply schemes. In addition, preliminary project activities, such as; identification of sites, water quality and quantity of sources, compensation of project Affected Persons (PAPs), and acquisition of land, among others, should be undertaken prior to handover of construction sites to contractors. Furthermore, Accounting Officer should ensure timely payment of contractors; implement activities according to approved budgets, and frequent discussion of monitoring and supervision reports to ensure snags are rectified in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\uf0fc Liaise with Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to source for sufficient funds to monitor and supervise activities for increased functionality and sustainability of the water supply schemes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nactivities, as well as inefficiencies in operations and maintenance of the rural water supply schemes, have stagnated the performance of the programme. These have been occasioned by delays in land acquisition, vandalism of the water system infrastructure, limitations in affordability of the service, inadequate monitoring and contract management, among others.\\n\\nIt is hoped that with the appropriate stakeholder engagement, closer monitoring and policy review, among others, the inadequacies in the rural water sub-sector will be reduced to enable the country benefit from effective and timely access to safe water.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5. **PART 5: HIGHLIGHTS FROM TREASURY MEMORANDA AUDIT**\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 13(f) of the National Audit Act 2008, I am required to undertake audit of the Treasury Memoranda.

Further, of the expected UGX.0.700Bn GOU co-funding, UGX. 0.699Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.001Bn representing 99.8% performance. Out of the total available funds of UGX.145.885Bn, UGX. 84.520Bn was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.61.365Bn representing an absorption level of 57.93%. This affected implementation of activities. I sampled four (4) activities worth UGX 63.061Bn and assessed the extent to which these had been implemented. Out of the 4 activities; two (2) activities were partially implemented, while 2 activities were not implemented. This affected service delivery. I noted a number of shortcomings from my inspections such as delayed works, incomplete structures, un-utilised agro processing facilities all of which affected service delivery. I noted avoidable expenditure on the procurement of M-Cash Uganda Limited as an E-Voucher management agency at a cost of UGX.6.8Bn. In addition, there was delayed operationalization of the M-cash electronic payment platform for eight (8) months due to the failure by MAAIF to integrate this financial inclusion system to the NITA‘s payment gateway in time leading to farmers and agro dealers failure to transact during this period. There was failure to refund unutilized balances to farmers, Agro-dealers and MAAIF by UBA to the tune UGX.8.8Bn on termination of their contract. 1\\\\.

Out of the 64 activities worth UGX.39.8Bn sampled; 28 activities representing 44% were fully implemented, 29 activities representing 45% were partially implemented while 7 activities representing 11% were not implemented. Physical inspection of three (3) construction projects worth UGX.22Bn namely; Irrigation Scheme in Acomai, National Metrology Laboratory at UNBS and holding grounds at Gwot Apwoyo Zonal Animal Disease control center revealed that works were behind schedule which will result in delayed service delivery to the citizens.

On the other hand, the approved GOU budget was 0.5Bn out of which UGX.0.398Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.102Bn which was 20% of the approved budget. Out of the total funds available from both donors and Gou of UGX 25.52Bn, UGX 8.897 was absorbed resulting in unspent balances of UGX 16.62Bn. This represents absorption of only 35% of the funds available. I observed that out of the 34 activities worth UGX.5.327Bn assessed; 14 activities- 41% were fully implemented, 15 activities-44% were partially implemented, while 5 activities-15% were not implemented. I noted shortcomings that affect service delivery for the citizens such as; failure to maintain demonstration gardens, delayed approval of District Nutrition Action plans, delayed release of funds to Districts, and unutilised funds at the Districts. 7\\\\.

The Shortfall affected implementation of activities |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I reviewed the implementation of a sample of two outputs with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX.7.5Bn. I |  \\n|^|<|<| noted that; 1 output with one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX.2Bn was fully implemented while 1 output |  \\n|^|<|<| with 3 activities worth UGX.5.5Bn was partially implemented. As a result, the entity did not finalise establishment |  \\n|^|<|<| of fish feed plant and animal feed production, processing, packaging and storage facilities on Centre farms. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 UGX.0.470Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted for and spent on other activities |  \\n|^|<|<| without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted challenges in regard to service delivery mainly resulting from delays and non-performing contracts. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted shortcomings in the management of land owned by the entity which included encumbrances on 5 pieces |  \\n|^|<|<| of land, lack of land titles for all 16 entity pieces of land, failure to transfer all the sixteen (16) land titles into the |  \\n|^|<|<| name and custody of the Uganda Land Commission, unutilized pieces of land. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity had outstanding arrears to the tune of UGX.1.31Bn which was an increment of 4.5% from the prior year |  \\n|^|<|<| arrears balance of UGX.1.25Bn |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 There was loss of 920 cattle, 521 goats and 1 pig estimated at UGX.0.33Bn through death and theft leading to |  \\n|^|<|<| loss of government biological assets and thus Government revenues. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I observed that letters of credit opened as far back as 2018/2019 had not performed which continued to affect |  \\n|^|<|<| progress of works and service delivery. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the entity management was not adhering to the approved staff structure during recruitment. Some of |  \\n|^|<|<| the positions were over filled while others were under-filled. In addition, 17 staff had been in acting positions for |  \\n|^|<|<| more than six months which was irregular. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted shortcomings in the management of IT Investments i.e. delays to implement the procured IT system, |  \\n|^|<|<| failure to dispose IT hardware equipment, inadequate Internal Audit review of the ICT systems that produce |  \\n|^|<|<| financial statements, lack of an approved IT risk management framework/policy and lack of a business continuity |  \\n|^|<|<| plan. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Withholding tax to the tune of UGX.0.33Bn from payments worth UGX.6.25Bn was not recovered from service |  \\n|^|<|<| providers. |  \\n\\n\\n358\\n\\n---\\n\\n| Out of the Donor budget of UGX.39.29Bn, only UGX.21.15Bn was availed for spending resulting in a shortfall of UGX.18.14Bn representing 46%. Further, of the UGX.4.897Bn GOU co-funding, only UGX.4.647Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.25Bn representing 5.1%. Out of the total available funds for the year of UGX.26.659Bn, only UGX.15.366Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.11.293Bn representing an absorption level of 58.5%. As a result of under-absorption, a number of planned activities were not implemented by the project which affected service delivery. Out of the sampled 88 activities worth UGX.9.67Bn assessed; 15 activities representing 17% were fully implemented, 22 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 51 activities representing 58% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement activities affects service delivery. I noted inadequacies in service delivery in form of delayed review of consultancy reports to enable approval of new hubs for oil palm growing by IFAD and delayed hand over of Land for the nucleus estates for oil palm development due to delays in transferring of titles for the acquired land. I noted non-remittance of loan recoveries to the UCF worth UGX.18.4Bn thus delaying implementation of critical government programs.

UGX.1.36Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approval. There was inadequate delivery of services to the citizens as highlighted by delays in construction of infrastructure projects (Dams, valley tanks, irrigation schemes), delayed delivery of vaccines and tractors, delayed distribution of tractors and failure to utilise well drilling rigs. I noted shortcomings in the management of Public Land for instance; failure to record land pieces in the assets register and GFMIS fixed asset module, encumbrances on 27 pieces of land through encroachment, lack of land titles for 59 pieces of land, non-quantification of planned land for acquisition, non-involvement of ULC in land acquisition, failure to transfer 4 land titles into the name and custody of the ULC, unutilised pieces of land, lack of land lease register and Irregular allocation of Land by District Land Boards.

I also noted that despite various efforts, the case turnaround time has remained stagnant at 30 days for over four financial years with no improvement. I observed that DGAL prioritises new cases over older cases. As a result, backlog cases which have remained unresolved for five (5) years or longer constitute 50% of all the backlog cases of DGAL. Although the Directorate spent UGX.1.05Bn on the operations of the regional laboratories, I noted that the regional laboratories are not sufficiently equipped for forensic analysis and are currently used by Scene of Crime Officers as temporary collection points for samples and exhibits before transferring them to the main laboratory for analysis. I reviewed the management of public land and noted that the entity did not maintain a land register or capture the owned land in the assets register in the Government’s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). I reviewed the management of IT systems and noted that DGAL had a number of IT Governance shortfalls. For instance, there were no structures to oversee ICT implementation, no approved IT staff structure, internal audit did not review ICT systems, and the entity did not have an approved IT risk management framework. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 3\\\\.

A comparison of the disbursement of JLOS SWAP funds to implementing entities and the actual expenditure revealed that out of the available sum of UGX. 123Bn, only UGX. 73Bn was spent, and Letters of Credit amounting to UGX.1.2Bn performed, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.48.7Bn. I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities by management and noted that all of the programme activities were quantified in the annual work plans.

The analysis revealed that out of the 1.77 million tickets issued in the last three |  \\n|^|<|<| financial years, 700,000 tickets worth UGX.94Bn were still unpaid at the time of audit. This was attributed to |  \\n|^|<|<| weaknesses in the enforcement of payment of traffic fines. Some offenders are untraceable, with no permanent |  \\n|^|<|<| addresses; others are foreigners, and yet there is no policy on enforcement procedures, especially for such |  \\n|^|<|<| defaulters. |  \\n\\n\\n376\\n\\n---\\n\\n|||<|<| \\uf0b7 There was a fire outbreak at Uganda Police’s Garment Factory in Lugogo along Jinja Road, which damaged both |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|^|<|<| equipment and materials, causing an estimated loss of UGX.1.95Bn.

Out of the budgeted funds of UGX.75.02Bn, only UGX.62.62Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX12.4Bn, which represents 16.5% of the approved budget. Out of the total approved NTR estimates of UGX.15Bn, only UGX5.3Bn was collected, representing a performance of only 35%. I sampled ten (10) outputs that had been fully quantified worth UGX.22Bn and noted that two outputs worth UGX.3.1Bn were fully implemented, and seven outputs worth UGX.18.9Bn were partially implemented. I reviewed the progress of enrolment and registration of citizens and noted that approximately 4.3 million Ugandans are still unregistered, and 419,055 have applied, but their applications are still under data processing. It takes an average of 21 days to process an application instead of the expected seven days if NIRA is working efficiently, indicating delays in the process. I noted that about 1.6 million cards were printed but not issued, and 1.5M of these have been unissued for a period exceeding six months.

For the year under review, NEC Agro SMC LTD posted a return on assets of 19% down from 21.6% posted in the previous year, representing a reduction in ROA of 12%. I noted that the company had a current ratio of 10.7 for the year under review which was above the desirable ratio of 1.5. This implies that the company is not facing liquidity problems.

Out of this, the entity absorbed UGX.65,215,742,112 which was only 30% of the funds availed. This affected the implementation of planned activities (all the three outputs planned for the year were partially implemented). |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity had an un-recovered long outstanding receivable of UGX.8,489,374,688 from Makerere University which |  \\n|^|<|<| remained outstanding for more than eight years. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity bought 518 hectares of land without notifying Uganda Land Commission and without obtaining approval |  \\n|^|<|<| for purpose of the land from the Uganda land Commission which contravened Section 49 (b) of the Land Act.

I could not carry out reconciliations between the figures in the Statement of Financial Performance and those in the statement of cash flows due lack of proper underlying records. As a result, I could not verify the accuracy of the figures reported in the statement of cash flows and the statement of financial performance. A review of the summary of Budget Performance and the Statement of Appropriation Account (Based on Nature of Expenditure) indicates that the company spent UGX.1.213Bn on fixed assets during the financial year. However, a review of the additions in the schedule of fixed assets, indicated that UGX.2.025Bn was spent on asset additions during the year. This led to a discrepancy of UGX.812Mn between the summary of budget performance and the statement of appropriation, and the fixed asset schedule amount in respect of asset additions. I was not provided with ledgers to enable reconciliations of the amounts. These inconsistencies cast doubt on the accuracy of the information presented concerning the expenditure on fixed assets. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources, and rates charged at the entity level for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that out of the UGX.2.757Bn budgeted to be collected in the year under review, only UGX.0.295Bn was collected during the year representing 11% of the budget. Such a performance on NTR collection \\uf0b7 Whereas a Trial Balance was presented in the financial statements as the basis for the account balances disclosed, I noted that the ledgers required to show the build-up of figures in the Trial Balance were incomplete. I further noted that the expenditure ledgers for Government subvention funds were inconsistent with the ones used to record expenditure of revenue from sales. I was therefore unable to confirm the correctness of the build-up of the figures in the Trial Balance, which was the basis for preparation and presentation of the financial statements. 4\\\\. Presidential Initiative Industrial Development (PIBID). 2020/2021 on Banana Disclaimer Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n380\\n\\n---\\n\\n| implies a significant failure of revenue collection strategies employed by the institution which may impact its sustainability. It was further allocated supplementary funding of UGX.527.8Mn for the PRESIDE research project, of which UGX.343.9Mn was received during the financial year and the balance received shortly after the close the financial year as a result, out of the 23 outputs assessed, 14 outputs representing 61% were fully implemented and 6 outputs representing 26% were partially implemented and 3 outputs representing 13% were not implemented. Failure tp fully implement planned activities may lead to inability to attain the intended project objectives. PBID has a secondary processing plant, which turns matooke chips into matooke flour with a capacity of 1 tonne per hour. During the audit, I was not provided with details of output during the period, but my anaysis of revenue reported during the year shows only UGX.295Mn was attained against a budget of UGX.2.757Bn. This implies the plant is grossly under utilised. Of the UGX.295Mn that was reported as collections from operations, only UGX.99Mn was banked. Out of the unbanked revenue of UGX.196Mn, only UGX.153.9Mn was accounted for in form of cash payments leaving a balance of UGX.42Mn unaccounted for. There is a risk that this amount was not put to proper use. PIBID lacked land titles for its land at Sanga (approximately 50 acres) and land located at Kyamuhanga (approximately 4 acres) exposing the land to the risk of encroachment and land grabbing. PIBID does not have an approved salary structure on which it pays individual staff. It should be noted that this issue has been re-occurring and Management has not taken action. Contracts totalling UGX.1.228Bn were signed by the entity without the approval of the Solicitor General contrary to Article 119 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended). This exposes government to risks of unfavaourable contractual terms and potential loss. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 5\\\\.

Out of this, UGX. 4.167Tn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1,236,047,040 representing an absorption level of 99.9%. I was not able to confirm the extent to which planned activities were implemented since the work plans did not have KPIs to facilitate measurement of performance. I noted that all land measuring approximately 7,562.072 hectares were not recorded in the entity land/assets register. I further noted that all land measuring approximately 7,562.0722 hectares were not recorded in the GFMIS fixed assets module of IFMS as required by the Treasury Instructions. I noted that 20 pieces of land measuring approximately 12,534.378 hectares had encumbrances in the form of encroachment. In addition, 31 pieces of land measuring approximately 15,585.337 hectares did not have land titles. The entity had domestic arrears amounting to UGX 314,062,612,228 as at 30th June 2022. I reviewed the Management of ICT systems and noted shortcomings for example; 13 IT systems/equipment were procured at a cost of UGX. 0.872,786,264 without clearance from NITA-U, the entity signed contracts worth 0.711Bn without clearance from Attorney General, and 5 IT projects worth 0.872Bn were not implemented within the required timelines, lack of business continuity plan, lack of ICT steering committee among others. I noted delayed completion of the UPDF National Referral Hospital at Lower Mbuya which resulted in delayed service delivery. I noted delayed compensation of court awards where in some cases the ministry had taken more than five (5) years to effect compensations. In addition, the Ministry did not have a comprehensive register of court awards and compensations made and outstanding. Ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs (MoDVA).

I assessed the implementation of a sample of three (3) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of eighteen (18) activities worth UGX.237.8Bn and noted that; One (1) output with seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.13.799Bn were fully implemented. Two (2) outputs with eleven (11) activities worth UGX.224Bn were partially implemented. Out of the eleven (11) activities, the entity fully implemented seven (7) activities; two (2) activities were partially implemented, while three (3) activities remained unimplemented. I noted that the project continued to cumulatively withdraw and disburse funds to the different subgroups in the implementing districts. This currently stands at UGX.536.62Bn. However, only UGX.363.19Bn (67.6%) has been utilised and accounted for. The balance of UGX.173.43Bn (32%) remained unutilised and on the bank accounts for the different subgroups. I reviewed the project\\'s performance against the results framework and observed that the project had achieved year four performance targets for nineteen (19) of the twenty-six (26) performance indicators representing 95%. However, seven (7) performance indicators in the project year three targets were not achieved. I noted that the implementing partners lacked tangible achievement in implementing their target activities in component 2 across all the districts due to the late engagement process of the implementing partners by DRDIP management and the six months suspension by the IGG. Additionally, the funds to the implementing partners only covered the labour training arrangements but did not consider the operational costs like fuel/ transport logistics. The project had an indicative planning figure of UGX.6.4Bn for implementing traditional and non-traditional livelihoods but did not disburse funds to appraised micro-projects for the year under review. I also noted that the project had not embarked on the procurement/ engagement process of the Capacity-Building Partners (CBPs) I noted that the project had outstanding commitments to the tune of UGX. 62,171,493 at the year-end. I noted that the DRDIP MIS was not yet integrated with other IT systems as required by the Project Implementation Manual. The un-integrated systems include; the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), OPM Geographical MIS used for monitoring and evaluation of government interventions across the country and the beneficiary registry in the Ministry of Gender. 1\\\\.

I however noted challenges with the expected credit loss model, like a |  \\n|^|^|<|<| lack of integration of the risk management framework into the financial reporting system, the different users of |  \\n|^|^|<|<| the model, were not trained on how to use the model and there were inconsistencies in the source of data for the |  \\n|^|^|<|<| model. |  \\n| 3. | \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 The Statement of Financial Position as at 30th June, 2022 reported the UPPC Investment in the Joint Venture (Uganda Security Printing Company Limited) at a cost of UGX.9.097Bn as valued by 30th June, 2020 but did not use the equity method as required by IFRS 11- Joint arrangements implying that the statement is misstated and misleading to the users. I noted that whereas the Tax records as per URA revealed a tax liability figure of UGX.1.609Bn, the Financial Statements disclosed only UGX.1.148Bn resulting in a variance of UGX.0.461Bn I noted that debtors worth UGX.3.76Bn have been outstanding for a period ranging between 361 days to 1800 days contrary to best practice thus limiting the availability of funds for UPPC activities. Review of the Corporation financial performance revealed a fall in profits of 64.4% from profits of UGX.3.38Bn realized in the previous year, a reduction of 21% on Return on Assets from 26% posted in the previous year, a liquidity ratio of 2.8 implying the Corporation is not efficiently using its current assets and failure to pay any dividend to government for the previous (3) years despite making profits. I noted that the Corporation did not have a functional Board of directors during the year under review since the tenure for the previous Board had elapsed in October 2021. Out of the approved staff establishment of 120 staff, only 69 were filled representing 57.5% thereby leaving a staffing gap of 51. I noted shortcomings in regard to procurement and utilization of IT equipment i.e. IT systems/equipment procured without clearance by NITA-U and neither recorded in the Assets register, failure to accurately record (35) IT assets worth UGX.0.256Bn in the right format, failure to allocate and engrave 25 IT assets to staff in the assets register, lack of specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation, non-representation of ICT in top management, lack of an approved IT staff structure, failure by internal Audit to review the various ICT systems and lack of rights to some of the systems, unapproved draft ICT policy, lack of a risk register and lack of a business continuity plan. I noted that (01) piece of land measuring 1.778 Hectares was disposed of as a contribution to the joint venture with USPC at UGX.9.091Bn below the Chief Government Valuer valuation of UGX.10.6Bn hence causing a financial loss of UGX.1.509Bn to Government and all the 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 1.256 hectares held by the entity valued at UGX4.151Bn were not fully utilized.

The programme failed to absorb UGX.0.27Bn, representing an absorption level of 99%. As a result, I noted that out of the three (3) outputs with nineteen (19) activities worth UGX.37Bn planned for execution, one (1) activity was fully implemented, seven (7) activities were partially implemented, while eleven (11) activities remained |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| unimplemented. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the programme experienced several challenges in implementing several activities, such as delays in |  \\n|^|<|<| completing some markets/facilities and operationalising constructed markets/facilities activities, which delayed the |  \\n|^|<|<| delivery of services to the citizens. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.0.14Bn during the year under review; however, UGX.0.37Bn was collected, representing a performance of 264% of the target. According to the approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.34.4Bn, out of which UGX.33.3Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.1.1Bn. The shortfall represents 3.2% of the approved budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.33.3Bn received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling to UGX.31.045Bn resulting in un-utilised warrants of UGX. 2.259Bn representing an absorption level of 93.2%. I assessed the implementation of a sample of twenty-two (22) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of one hundred forty-six (146) activities worth UGX.23.63Bn and noted that; three (3) outputs with twelve (12) activities and expenditure worth UGX.10.02Bn were fully implemented. Nineteen (19) outputs with one hundred thirty-four (134) activities worth UGX.13.6Bn were partially implemented. Out of the one hundred thirty-four (134) activities, the entity fully implemented fifty-five (55) activities; fifty-five (55) activities were partially implemented, while twenty- four (24) activities remained unimplemented. I undertook physical inspections to establish if works/services were delivered. I noted performance gaps and delays in the renovation of Ministry premises; operationalisation of new cities; operations of the civil service college; compliance with service delivery standards; harmonisation of salaries in Government and roll out and implementation of the Human Capital Management System (HCM). I noted that though the second phase of implementation of the pay policy was scheduled for FYR 2019/20, the MoPS failed to secure a budget allocation with MoFPED for financing pay enhancement. Also, there was no uniform percentage enhancement of the Public officers to benefit from salary enhancement. Additionally, selective enhancement of salaries for cadres like science teachers executing the same job as artisan teachers in public service has further demotivated the workforce. 5\\\\.

I noted that the expiry of the five years approved pay targets and principles would elapse in the FYR ended 2022/23.

The revised PSC Guidelines to DSCs and the Assessment tool for Minimum Conditions and Performance Standards have not yet been approved by the Commission awaiting the approval of the PSC Regulations. I noted that several stakeholders particularly the Ministry of Public Service, Ministry of Local Government, Education Service Commission, and Health Service Commission are undertaking similar and complementary roles with the DSCs however, a review of the existing coordination arrangements revealed weaknesses in how PSC coordinates with other players.

As a result, I noted that of the 40 quantified activities worth UGX.23.51Bn assessed; 16 activities representing 40% were fully implemented, 18 activities representing 45% were partially implemented, and 6 activities representing 15% were not implemented. |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The Ministry experienced challenges and delays in the implementation of some activities which affected service |  \\n|^|<|<| delivery. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I observed that the MoLG did not make a budgetary provision for the settlement of court awards and compensation |  \\n|^|<|<| liabilities. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the Ministry did not have approved selection criteria and allocation guidelines for the allocation of |  \\n|^|<|<| start-up funds to the beneficiary Local Governments. Consequently, the Ministry allocated an arbitrary start-up |  \\n|^|<|<| amount of UGX.50 million to each of the beneficiary local Governments irrespective of the differences in the |  \\n|^|<|<| requirements and size of the newly created administrative units. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that despite the Government commitment to co-fund projects to the tune of USD 22.89 million, only USD |  \\n|^|<|<| 8.03 million was paid, leaving USD 14.86 million outstanding. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the Ministry delayed operationalizing the Busega Market which delayed service delivery to the citizens. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the Ministry did not carry out the induction of newly elected Local Government leaders in 110 Districts |  \\n|^|<|<| and 19 Municipalities with their Lower Local Governments; only 10 Cities and 2 Districts of Mpigi and Mityana were |  \\n|^|<|<| inducted using USMID and KOICA funding, while 23 Districts had induction of only the Higher Local Government |  \\n|^|<|<| Councils |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that despite the submission of the cost implication two years after approval of the creation of cities, the |  \\n|^|<|<| cities are still operating on the budgets of Municipal Councils because they have not yet received funding for city |  \\n|^|<|<| status which hinders service delivery. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that several Districts and Cities had not constituted Service Commissions, while others were functional but |  \\n|^|<|<| not fully constituted. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the Ministry did not have specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation. There was |  \\n|^|<|<| no approved IT risk management framework/policy, and risk register and there was no business continuity plan, |  \\n|^|<|<| contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 I reviewed the budget performance for the project for the year and noted that out of the planned expenditure of UGX.53,057,264,072, only UGX 19,072,116,523 was spent, resulting in an absorption level of 36%. There is a risk that some key project activities may not be implemented by the end of the implementation period, which is 31st August 2023, resulting in repetitive project extensions.

From a total of 12,100 |  \\n|^|<|<| seedlings sampled from the distribution lists, only 2670 seedlings where acknowledged as received by the farmers |  \\n|^|<|<| and 9,430 seedlings not accounted for. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.313.67Bn, only UGX.303.11Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.13.56Bn representing an absorption level of 95.7%. However, I could not assess the implementation of all the forty-six (46) outputs worth UGX.316Bn with 137 activities since they were not quantified. The Authority had a long-term liability of UGX.42Bn on its balance sheet from a development credit agreement entered. In addition, the entity had outstanding commitments to the tune of UGX.24.98Bn at the year-end and unremitted statutory deductions amounting to UGX.4.107Bn The Authority delayed the commencement of the Kampala Rehabilitation project by eleven (11) months after the intended effectiveness date. The entity incurred Nugatory expenditure -Interest on delayed payments worth UGX.94m The Authority managed to recover only UGX.1.46Bn out of UGX.4.628Bn YLP funds disbursed to the youth groups since the programme’s inception. I noted that the Authority had not yet come up with the regulations to operationalize the 2019 outdoor ordinance as such, could not collect revenue from outdoor advertising activities. I noted that 928 schools out of 1,927 were not registered with KCCA representing 48%, while provisional licenses for 102 schools out of the 134 schools with provisional licenses had expired, implying that the schools were operating illegally. I noted that Capital City Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had not been established, as I was not provided evidence of its existence and functionality. Despite 2022 being the final year (expiry of the ten years) of implementing the Consultancy recommendations on KPDP, the Authority had not prepared an implementation and evaluation report to evaluate the plan’s performance. 19\\\\.

Failure to achieve the targets implies that the goal of generating revenue through promoting tourism may not be achieved. Although the Mission charter provides for acquisition of property annually, it was noted that no property had been acquired. Instead, the Mission spent Euros 9,000 on rent of the Official residence monthly. At the time of audit inspection the renovation works for the chancery had stalled due to delayed payments dating back to February 2022,and this exposed the Mission to extra monthly costs such as; rent for new 59\\\\.

There is a risk of prevention of certification and/or embargo on Uganda Seed exports to the European and other markets.

Out of the appropriated budgeted of UGX.6.923Bn, only UGX.3.465Bn (representing 50% of the budget) was warranted leading to inability by the Mission to undertake the majority of the planned activities. I observed that the released funds could barely cover employee costs and the majority of the planned activities were not funded. I observed that although the Mission in Pretoria has over the years been employing local staff, there was no social security/gratuity scheme for such staff. It was further observed that although a local consultant was engaged, who compiled a valuation of how much is due for all staff (both current and those who exited), the current staff contracts have not been amended to cater for staff gratuity/social security, going forward.

At the closur 1 e of the period, UGX.1.348Bn had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.0.331Bn. The practice amounts to a violation of regulations and could lead to misallocation of the Embassy’s funds. I noted that the Assets Register maintained by the Mission was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions, and several asset details were missing. I also noted a number of unserviceable items recommended for disposal in the prior financial year but still remained undisposed at the end of 2020/2021. The Mission owns two chancery buildings in Washington DC. The Board of Survey and an engineering assessment on the buildings disclosed the following among other issues; o  The back porch of one of the buildings continued to disintegrate due to an unstable foundation. o  The Chancery buildings on plots 5909 and 5911 had shown serious structural cracks ranging from 1mm to 7mm. The landing rear porch of building on plot 5909 had completely failed. o  The buildings were susceptible to storm water, which was disastrous to their integrity given that the interior of the buildings was made of wood. The incomplete splash aprons were noted to be allowing water in the buildings. My inspection of the buildings revealed structural issues including corrosion of water pipes, cracks in the buildings, detached chimney on building on 5911 and detached porch on building on plot 5909. The buildings are likely to deteriorate further if no urgent civil works are undertaken, which renders their occupancy by Mission staff and their clients unsafe. Delayed works may also render the repairs more costly. 67\\\\. Uganda Embassy in Washington Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 68\\\\.

The entity had domestic arrears totaling to UGX.37Bn most of which related to unpaid contributions to International organizations. I noted that the Medical Insurance provided to staff of the Missions abroad was inadequate and did not cover some of the illnesses suffered by the Mission staff abroad. I further observed that the current abridged PPDA guidelines for missions abroad were not applicable in most host countries which resulted in non-compliance with the same. There was no mechanism to follow up and track promises and offers made by other governments to the Government of Uganda which resulted in loss of opportunities for Ugandans.

As a result some key activities like PAPs are not paid, Railway infrastructure rehabilitation not undertaken and EACAA School is not rehabilitated. MOWT was responsible for making payments under the contract for civil works for the Rehabilitation of the Tororo- Gulu Railway. However, the contractor terminated the contract due to failure by the Government of Uganda to meet its obligations but an advance payment of EUR.8,854,839.68 remained un recovered from the contractor. I assessed the implementation of a sample of twenty (22) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of one hundred and ten (110) activities worth UGX.693Bn and noted that; five (5) outputs with eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX.294.6Bn were fully implemented, fifteen (15) outputs with ninety seven (97) activities worth UGX.390.4Bn were partially implemented and two (2) outputs with five (5) activities worth UGX.8.1Bn were not implemented at all. UGX.3,577,035,246 was irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. An inspection of the regional mechanical workshops established that 23 District road equipment remained in the Workshops’ yards for a period of between one to five years without repair. They are thus not serving their purpose An inspection of the East African civil Aviation Academy (Soroti Flying School) indicated that all its nine (9) training aircrafts were grounded due to the expiry of their insurance and/or being faulty. I further noted that three aircrafts involved in accidents during the year under review had not been repaired due to the delayed compensation by the insurance service provider. Land acquired under the SGR project, measuring approximately 1,305.886 acres costing UGX.99,343,193,128 was not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. I observed that a total of two (2) IT systems/equipment with a total cost of UGX.200,780,000 were implemented without business cases and approval by NITA-U. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 2\\\\.

In spite extension of the project closure date now planned as 12 October 2024 from 30th April 2020 as per the approved extension, a review of the monthly June 2021 Progress report, established that the cumulative physical progress as at 30th June 2021 was only 1.5% against 11.5% planned, resulting in an overall slippage of 13%. The contractors delayed to mobilize heavy machinery and equipment for works, slow progress by management to secure a right of way due to slow compensation to people affected by the road project (PAPs) and COVID-19 pandemic whereby the Contractors could not carry out the activities as planned due to restricted movements both local and international. I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired for the entire road having a total length of 191 Km for which compensation had been made is still in process.

This is an increase of 96% beyond the budgeted amount for this activity casting doubt to the comprehensiveness of the feasibility studies undertaken by the UNRA and the Contractor before BoQs were made. I noted that the progress of work did not match the remaining period to the completion date. The road works were estimated to be at 68%, the OSBP at 25% and Suam Bridge at 70% with just few months to reach contract completion date. I further noted that some of the project components had not been implemented at the time of audit these include; Training in labor based construction techniques, Refurbishment of a post-crash care center and procurement of theatre equipment. I noted that the contracts signed by the consultants required them to provide the Professional liability insurance of 110% of the contract value but those provided did not cover the entire period If there is no Insurance cover as per the PPDA regulations, UNRA will not have a fallback position in case the consultants do not meet their contractual obligations. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 8\\\\.

I noted delays in project implementation with cumulative physical progress as at 30th June 2021 at only 2.71% against 15.59% planned, resulting in an overall slippage of 12.88%. Contrary to the requirements of Clause 2.1 of the Contract Agreement between UNRA and the Contractor I noted that there were still some sections of the road that had pending land acquisition issues that needed to be addressed. I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired land (Muyembe-Nakapiripirit road having a total length of 92 Km) for which compensation had been made is still in process.

This action overrides established budgeting procedures without the Minister’s approval. I reviewed the financing charges on the ADF loan and noted that total charges of UGX.3,357,809,609 were accrued on the disbursed and undisbursed loan balances with ADF during FY 2021/22. Furthermore, due to delayed procurement, prolonged acquisition of the Project right-of-way, and slow execution of works by the Contractors, the initial disbursement deadline of 31st December 2020 was extended to 31st December 2024. The implication is that the project is exposed to higher avoidable interest charges accruing from undisbursed loan balance due to loan under-utilization and hence delayed implementation of Project activities. The upgrade of the Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu 78.5 km stretch attained 25.75% physical progress during the FY 2021/22. Cumulatively, since the Project’s inception, 68.35% physical progress had been attained, against the planned progress of 84.30% as of 30th June 2022. The slippage of 15.95% recorded was attributed to encumbrances on land on sections that required extra land take beyond the 30m standard Right of Way, excessive rainfall in the region, and the Contractors restricted access to Ishasha Bridge.Time elapsed as of 30th June 2022 was 43.8 months representing 88.3% of the total extended civil works contract duration of (49.6 months).

The Project cost increased by UGX.340,948,885 in respect of interest paid and interest payable during the year under review alone.

Out of the budget realized, MSC failed to absorb funds to a tune of UGX.31.934bn representing 7.93% of the realized funds limiting the service delivery.\\n\\n- An audit of expenditure revealed that MSC effected reallocations/ virements on the budget line items worth UGX.1,015,000,000 from the departments of Finance, Administration and Human Resources, affecting the implementation of the planned outputs.\\n\\n- A review of the loan portfolio of the company revealed that a total of UGX.126.37 billion relating to conventional lending was outstanding in loans and advances as at 30th June 2021. The portfolio had grown from UGX.75.14 Bn in 2019 by UGX.57 billion over the three years to UGX.126.37 Billion, locking funds to other befitting clients.\\n\\n- During FY 2020/21, the MSCL Board approved the write-off of 167 loans amounting to UGX.4,682,672,669 without following the Public Finance Management Act 2015, which requires approval by the Parliament on write off above 10 million. The total loans written-off (incl. Principal, interest and charges/penalties) over the same period amounted to UGX.27,515,715,35. I noted that FYs 2020/21 (20.7%), 2014/15(37.9%) and 2012/13 (19.1%) accounted for the highest proportion of loan write-offs attributed when compared to the total loan amount disbursed over since 2005.

MSCL wage and other staff-related costs have increased to UGX.11,117,980,000 over the years, representing 211% variance from the approved Government wage ceiling. I observed that during the period under review, a total of UGX.57,667,906,500 was disbursed to various beneficiaries in the form of special Grants without a grant management policy.

I further noted that of the total warrants of UGX.8.310Bn, the Board spent a total of UGX.7.528Bn resulting into unspent warrants of UGX.0.782Bn. Unreleased and unutilised funds signify failure to implement all the planned activities which negatively impacts service delivery. The Board remained understaffed with only had 36 positions out of 51 approved positions leaving a gap of 15 positions, representing 30% of the approved structure. Understaffing constrains effective service delivery. The Board failed to prepare 4 Statutory Regulations to regulate the industry contrary to the provision of Section 70 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015. I noted that the entity failed to prepare a National Register of gaming or betting machines and devices, as provided for under Section 36 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015. Absence of a register of machines and equipment being used in the industry, complicates monitoring and renewal of licences and also exposes the industry players to risks of using inappropriate machinery and equipment. \\uf0b7 I carried out a review of management of IT investments at the entity and noted that; o  138 IT assets (100%) inspected over the period under review were not accurately recorded in the Assets register. 14\\\\.

As a result, I |  \\n|^|<|<| noted that of the 64 outputs that I sampled, Eighteen (18) outputs were fully implemented, thirty-six (36) outputs |  \\n|^|<|<| were partially implemented, Seven (7) out puts were not implemented, while Three (3) out puts could not be |  \\n|^|<|<| assessed. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The Ministry did not have a running strategic plan to facilitate achievement of the NDP III objectives. This poses |  \\n|^|<|<| a risk of non-attainment of NDP III objectives since the strategic plan that would serve as basis for the annual |  \\n|^|<|<| plan and budget that is being implemented is non-existent. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Domestic arrears stock was reported as UGX.473Bn as at the end of the financial year 2021/22 up from |  \\n|^|<|<| UGX.268.9Bn in F/Y 2020/21 representing 76% increase. The Domestic arrears are not given appropriate budget |  \\n|^|<|<| provision hence accumulation of the stock. Failure to budget and pay arrears negatively impacts the |  \\n|^|<|<| creditworthiness of the Ministry and could result into penalties and costly litigations. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The Ministry did not disclose contingent liabilities worth UGX2.839Bn in the memorandum statement of Contingent |  \\n|^|<|<| liabilities. This denies end users of the Financial Statements useful information for decision making. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The Ministry has seven (7) IT systems which were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with |  \\n|^|<|<| other systems. This could lead to duplication of functionalities, procurement of non-compatible solutions and |  \\n|^|<|<| equipment, and general deviation from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service delivery. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2020/21) was **UGX.45.49Trillion,** which would have translated into **UGX.227.47Bn** funding for the Contingencies Fund in the year under review, in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015. I however noted the following; Unqualified 30\\\\. Contingencies Fund Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n450\\n\\n---\\n\\n| o  Parliament appropriated **UGX.62.07Bn** out of **UGX.227.47Bn** (27.3%) to the Contingencies Fund, leading to a deficit of **UGX.165.40Bn** (72.7%).  o Due to an upsurge of COVID-19, additional funds were appropriated via a supplementary budget of **UGX.228.30Bn,** making a total of **UGX.290.37Bn.**  o  Out of the total warrants of **UGX.290.37Bn,** only **UGX.72.06Bn (24.8%)** was released to the MDAs for emergencies, leading to a total deficit of **UGX.219.33Bn** (75.5%). The continued failure to appropriate funds in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), is an indicator of noncompliance and defeats the intentions of the law. \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 31\\\\. Treasury Operations Unqualified Opinion |<|<| \\uf0b7 The Treasury Operations had an initial approved budget of **UGX.15.094Tn** which was later revised to |  \\n|^|<|<| **UGX.17.863Tn.** Out of the revised Budget, **UGX.17.391Tn** was warranted, out of which, **UGX.13.959Tn** was utilized by the entity resulting into an unutilized balance of **UGX.3.432Tn** representing a performance level of 80.26%. Audit however noted that the entity remained with a total of **UGX.4.661Tn** as payables at year end. |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 There are was a significant change of the reported payables from **UGX.2.345Tn** to **UGX.4.583Tn** resulting into |  \\n|^|<|<| an increase of **UGX.2.238Tn** representing 95%. The significant increment in the liabilities was due to the |  \\n|^|<|<| International Court of Justice ruling in favour of Democratic Republic of Congo to a tune of UGX.1.228Tn and the |  \\n|^|<|<| assumption of Uganda Telcom liabilities of UGX.0.028Tn. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Audit noted that as regards the management of Boards for Corporations and companies in which Government has |  \\n|^|<|<| shareholding, there were no clear guidelines, policies or regulations for the management, appointment, evaluation |  \\n|^|<|<| or determination of such Boards. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The government is defaulting on the payment of an outstanding balance of **USD.889,411.24 (UGX.3,343Bn)** |  \\n|^|<|<| out of a total **USD.1,659,450.22** as a 10 th Instalment for 51 callable shares from African Development Bank |  \\n|^|<|<| (ADB). Failure to pay-up on callable shares puts the country at a risk of losing paid up shares and the corresponding |  \\n|^|<|<| callable shares in the Bank. |  \\n| Out of the approved budget of **UGX.154.18Bn** for capital expenditure, Emyooga grant and other recurrent expenditures, **UGX.146.85Bn** was realized and **UGX.125.65Bn** was spent, leaving **UGX.21.2Bn** unspent which represents 14.4% of the realized funds. Unspent funds represent services not delivered. A total of **UGX.1.44Bn** was disbursed as additional capitalization to the existing EMYOGA SACCOs when they had not made recoveries of above 70% of the first seed capital disbursed, as evidenced by the loan disbursement and recovery schedules submitted by the respective SACCOs. This can lead to disbursements to SACCOs that are already at default. The loan portfolio of the company has grown from **UGX.105Bn** in 2020 to **UGX.146Bn** over the three years representing a 39% growth. However, a total of **UGX.3.7Bn** was disbursed to several clients without undertaking adequate loan appraisal documentation, hence an increase in default risk exposure as well as potential loss to government. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 32\\\\. Microfinance SupportCenter (MSC) Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n451\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 I reviewed the loan portfolio and noted that an average of 53% and 52% of impaired loans was registered in the financial years 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively, while there has been a progressive increase to 71% in the financial year ended 30 th June 2022. Such increases imply that there are more loans that are likely to become uncollectable and therefore leading to loss to government. \\uf0b7 I noted weaknesses in the IT systems which include; o  There was no evidence of systems ownership  o  The two systems operated by the entity were not integrated or not automatically sharing information o  There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.  o  There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy and risk register at the entity.  o  There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy with other systems. 2014. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 33\\\\. National Population Council (NPC) Unqualified Opinion |<|<| The entity was supposed to receive UGX.16.191Bn out of which UGX.12.742Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.449Bn. The shortfall represents 21.3% of the approved budget. As a result some activities planned for the year, were not implemented, which negatively impacts on service delivery. \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity had an approved staff structure of 97 positions, out of which 74 (76%) positions were filled, leaving 23 |  \\n|^|<|<| (23.7%) positions not yet filled.

Uganda Property Holdings Limited (UPHL) Unqualified Opinion |<|<| The entity budgeted to collect UGX.11.16Bn revenue and collected UGX.10.88Bn resulting into an underperformance of UGX.0.28, which was 2.6% of the budget. The underperformance in NTR collections was partly attributed to the depreciating value of the Uganda shilling against the Kenyan shilling and the Great Britain Pound. \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the entity had receivables from UGX.4.7Bn in the statement of financial position at year-end implying |  \\n|^|<|<| that these were not honoured within the 15 working days as required by regulations thereby holding up funds |  \\n|^|<|<| which would have been used to implement planned activities. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 A review of the properties owned by the Government of Uganda within and outside the country revealed that |  \\n|^|<|<| several commercial properties are not owned and managed by UPHL, yet the company was established majorly to |  \\n|^|<|<| hold, invest in and control the real estate properties of the Government of Uganda. The properties risk being |  \\n|^|<|<| condemned because of poor management. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The company procured IT systems which were not integrated thereby not meeting the intended objective of shared |  \\n|^|<|<| information. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 I noted that Uganda Property Holdings Limited did not manage some Government Commercial properties. This company was established principally to own, invest in and control the real estate Properties of the Government of Uganda. As a result, some commercial buildings in Nairobi, Kinshasa, and London are not well maintained to the extent of being at risk of condemnation by the relevant city authorities, like the Commercial Building in Nairobi. Management explained that the cabinet is handling the issue, and I am waiting for the cabinet\\'s decision. Uganda Property Holding has 39 properties comprising of 23 in Mombasa, 12 in Uganda, and 4 in the UK. I reviewed all ownership documents for the said properties and found that two properties did not have certificates of title, namely, Plot M82, Masese, Jinja, and Plot KRC Mbaraki, Mombasa. I advised management to follow up on the above properties and secure their ownership by obtaining the certificate of titles. 36\\\\.

Out of the planned 493 compliance audits, only 227 (46%) were carried out, implying that the corrective actions that would have been undertaken to enhance tax compliance were impeded. This negatively affected revenue collection. Despite several tax heads having 0 (zero) budgeted revenue, a total of UGX.370.58Bn was collected from the tax heads in question - contrary to the provisions in Paragraph 4.19.3 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 and Section 45(3) of the PFMA, 2015.

This limits the Authority’s capacity to duly implement all its mandate. A review of the Authority’s procurement plan, procurement files and the annual procurement report/register, indicated that procurements worth UGX.0.114Bn were not implemented. This in turn leads to delayed delivery of services. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 41\\\\. Financial Intelligence Authority.

I further noted that out of the total receipts for the year, only UGX.6.332Bn was expensed, leading to a surplus of UGX.1.992Bn representing 69% absorption. Also noted was that out of the eleven (11) planned activities, the entity fully implemented five (5) activities, while four (4) activities were partially implemented, and two (2) activities remained unimplemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery. ITC acquired fourteen (14) IT assets worth UGX.326.9Mn without clearance from NITA-U.

I noted that there was no segregation of duties between the function of the Board of the Tribunal and the \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| Administrative Function. This is because the members of the Tribunal execute both functions. |  \\n| The Authority collected revenue UGX.20.02Bn out of a budget of UGX.21.55Bn.

As a result, some of the Authority planned activities remained unimplemented, due to failure to absorb all the availed funding, which in turn, negatively impacts service delivery. The entity paid mandatory (10%) contributions to the National Social Security Fund worth UGX.301.66Mn, and also paid an extra UGX.446.04Mn to a second standard contribution scheme operated by the Authority. This resulted into a double payment of gratuity contributions contrary to the requirements of the Public Service Standing Orders. The responsible Minister had not constituted the Capital Markets Tribunal to handle disputes arising out of disputes in the sector. The entity also lacked some critical regulations necessary for the management of the activities of the Authority. The audit of the licensing function revealed that: The Authority conducted irregular licensing without prescribed fees being paid, the entity failed to follow up licensees with expired licenses, the entity failed to collect security deposit from Brokers dealers licensed, lacked evidence of proper due diligence, and also failed to license primary dealers of Government Bonds. Such weaknesses point to challenges in execution of its mandate which could lead to failure to collect all potential revenues. In the audit of Human Resource management, I noted that the Authority lacked an approved staff and salary structure, contrary to the standing orders. There were also no comprehensive annual performance plans and Job Descriptions for the staff during the year under review. This complicates assessment of staff performance at year end. 48\\\\.

There were unsupported payables of UGX.3.904 Bn, of which Administrative fees of UGX.2.022Bn and Actuarial fees of UGX.442Mn. Under the circumstances, it was difficult to provide assurance that the amounts in question are genuine liabilities to the Scheme. I further noted that the amounts have not changed over the years implying Scheme’s inability to settle its obligations. Disclosed under Note 15 to the Financial Statements on page 22, are receivables recognised by the Scheme amounting to UGX.4.171Bn, up from UGX.4.038Bn the previous year, arising from amounts due from employers (UTL In-Administration). However, these receivables were not supported with any documentation and schedule to confirm the amounts and authenticity, which renders the receivables doubtful. I further noted that as reported in the previous year, according to UTL in-administration, only UGX.2.466Bn was due to UCECPS, implying a variance of UGX.1.705Bn. 51\\\\.

I noted that the expenditure exceeded the cash collection, and payments were made using the cash balances carried forward from FY 2019/2020. I established from the statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits on page 14 of the financial statements that the current assets amounting to UGX.4,550,343,000 was due from government. This arose after management on the advice of government, diverted money from the Defined Contributions (DC) active members Fund to pay the increased monthly pensions to the Defined Benefits members, thus creating a deficit/Liability to the scheme. PS/ST directed that UCECPS transfer the files of all pensioners of UPTC to the line Ministry of Information Communication Technology and National Guidance (MoICT&NG) to facilitate the payment of the pensioners effective FY 2020/2021 in accordance with the decentralisation policy. I noted however that, the decision to streamline pension payments has created uncertainty on the continuity of UCECPSs. During the year under review, the scheme expected a total sum of UGX.331,340,796 from the Employer (UTL) as a contribution to the members. However, only UGX.310,962,857 was remitted relating to arrears which in turn led to the monthly interest which accumulated to UGX.112,119,561. The total amounts due from the employers (UTL) had accumulated to UGX.4,171,050,819 as of 30th June 2021. PAYE of UGX.44,867,514 withheld from employees as required during the year was never remitted to URA by the year end. I further noted that the accumulated PAYE arrears stood at UGX.241,677,000.

Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities. The Institute has total receivables of UGX.440,038,625 in the statement of financial position, which includes an amount of UGX.343,855,528 relating to student debtors. The student-related receivables grew by 11% from UGX.308,954,465 (2019/20) to UGX.343,855,528 (2020/2021). The institute and staff who were in acting position for more than 6 months, contrary to Section 3.3.5.1 of the UICT Human Resource Manual 2018 that requires that acting appointments not to exceed six (6) months, save for special circumstances approved by the Governing Council.

Un utilised funds imply that some planned activities may not have been implemented, leading to delayed service delivery. The Commission irregularly paid UGX.228Mn for extra civil works on the installation of Lifts at Communications House. The additional works were not part of the original contract and were not approved by the Commission’s Contract Committee, contrary to the procurement regulations. The Commission did not charge 2% Gross Annual Revenue for Registered Television Stations and FM Radio stations as required by the UCC New License framework on fees and fines under General Notice No. 977 of 2017. This deprives the Commission of revenue. The Commission does not have procedures on management of confiscated equipment. This may lead to misuse of the confiscated equipment and may deepen disputes and cause financial losses to Government. The Commission has delayed completion of the National E-commerce Platform aimed at supporting SMEs in the informal sectors of the Agriculture, Retail and Services industry in Uganda, in order to promote access to online sales, overcome challenges in delivering to too hard-to-reach communities and to spur economic growth. As a result, the informal sector is losing out on the benefits of E-commerce. Eight (8) IT systems/equipment procured at UGX.9.8Bn were not cleared by NITA-U contrary to current guidelines. Besides, six (6) IT systems developed in-house were not being optimally utilized by the entity, while three (3) systems were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with other systems.

I noted that of the 19 outputs that I sampled, 12 outputs with 14 activities were fully implemented, 15 quantified activities of the 5 outputs were not implemented. 2 outputs could not be assessed due to lack of performance targets and indicators. Failure to fully implement all planned outputs negatively impacts service delivery. The Project remained with outstanding payables totalling to UGX.5.08Bn by the end of year, which were as a result of completion works for the last mile project whose payments were not made to the contractors. World Bank/IDA cautioned and notified NITAU and MoFPED that it would not pay or take on any project liabilities after 31st December 2022. This implies that Government may have to bear the burden of paying the respective suppliers. A total of USD.249,500 was spent without obtaining a no objection from the World Bank in accordance with the funding guidelines. This caused the PS/ST to instruct the Accounting Officer of NITAU to refund the money to abate the risk of affecting funding of other ongoing World Bank Projects. The Project failed to upgrade the service desk due to the limited time to procure and implement the works before project closure in December 2022. Consequently, a total of USD.664,160.64 was reallocated from the IT service desk budget to upgrade the Data centre. 57\\\\.

Further analysis on trade and other payables revealed that some payables had remained outstanding for more than eight years old without any movements. The increased payables expose the Corporation to a risk of costly litigation as well as penalties and fines from statutory bodies. The Corporation has contingent liabilities outstanding as of 30th June 2022 of UGX.6.252Bn. This figure significantly increased by 300% from UGX.1.827Bn as at 30th June 2021. This figure will worsen the liability position if it materialises. The Corporations’ strategic plan running for the period 2017-2022 had expired and Management was in process of designing a new one aligned to NDPIII. It implies the organisastion is being managed without a strategic direction. The Corporation has an approved staff establishment for 353 positions of which 99 (28%) positions remained vacant due to indequate wage. This undermines service delivery. The Corporation does not have Land titles for 36 pieces of land it currently owns. Further, the Corporation owns 80 acres of land as per Vesting Order at Bobi-Gulu and the land is not being utilized and hosts equipment that is not on air. Lack of Land titles may result in encroachment, disputes and even loss of public land. The Corporation has land titles for 19 pieces of land which were leased out, however there were no lease agreements for 10 of these pieces of land. In addition, out of 19 pieces of land leased out, 6 pieces had expired leases.

As a result, three (3) outputs were partially implemented, hence negatively affecting public service delivery. The Authority did not have Land titles for four (4) pieces of land measuring 173.1 Acres in various parts of the country. This increases the risk of exposure to land grabbing and encroachment. I noted that contrary to Section 76 of UFZA Act 2014, which requires the Authority, in each year, within two months after the end of the financial year, to submit to the Minister, a statement of its activities in the preceding financial year, indicating any particular problems experienced by the Authority in that year in carrying out its objects and functions and making recommendations for resolving those problems and containing such other information as the Minister may direct, at the time of the audit in October 2022, the Authority had not prepared the report to the Minister for the financial year 2021/2022. Failure to produce and submit the required reports implies that the Minister and eventually Parliament to whom the annual report should be submitted by the Minister, did not assess the Authority’s performance. 6\\\\.

I observed that, although the PS/ST authorized the change in the Ministry’s workplan to enable the Accounting Officer to utilize the funds requested, for renovation of premises as opposed to rent, the ministry has not recorded the resulting prepayment, since the amount is question is to be recovered through rental deductions, following an MoU signed with Uganda Property Holdings Limited, who own the premises that were renovated. Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares (100%) costing UGX.0.822Bn were not recorded in the Ministry’s land register. In addition, Property comprised in Plots 9, 11 and 13 Corporation rise - Bukoto Kampala, valued at UGX.1.935Bn (Land - UGX.1.77Bn and Developments UGX.159.8 Mn) had no land title and was not disclosed in the memorandum Statement. Failure to properly record all public land could cpmplicate proper follow up of such land. Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares held by the Ministry did not have Land titles, yet they were acquired over 16 years ago. This exposes such land to a risk of loss through encroachment and land grabbing. Five (5) plots acquired by Government of Uganda to resettle the metal fabricators previously operating along Katwe road under their association Katwe Small Scale Industrial Development Association (KSIDA), measuring approximately 0.435 hectares (14%) and costing UGX.0.505Bn was irregularly transferred to KSIDA as the user under Uganda Land Commission instead of Ministry of Trade as the rightful user. Land measuring 1.462 hectares (47%) acquired at UGX.0.217Bn out of the 3.107 hectares of land owned by the Ministry, had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions and encroachment as there was a legal challenge with a private company. I observed that the Ministry disclosed domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 of UGX.4.2Bn (2020/2021: UGX.16.4Bn). I noted that although the ministry settled a total of UGX.12.3Bn in lieu of subscription fees to \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives Industry and Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n468\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 international organisations, the Ministry was not able to fully settle the opening domestic arrears due to insufficient budgetary provisions. This exposes government to a risk of litigation and possible unnecessary litigation costs. A total of UGX.27.9Bn was paid to 13 Cooperative Societies, yet these were not in the original Ministry’s work plan. This creates unfairness and lack of transparency in the settlement of the outstanding compensation funds. \\uf0b7 War claims compensation of UGX.29.09Bn was made to third parties but not directly to the beneficiary Cooperative societies for onward remittance to beneficiary Cooperative members. I found the practice of payment through third parties both inconveniencing and exposing government to a risk of loss of public funds to non-bonafide members, given the lack of participation of members of the cooperative societies. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 9\\\\.

There is a risk that sub-standard |  \\n|^|<|<| goods are entering the Ugandan market through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity had accrued pension and gratuity of UGX.1.29Bn contrary to regulations. Non-payment of pension leads |  \\n|^|<|<| to the accumulation of arrears and affects the livelihood of the pensioners. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 There was no particular budget line for destroying substandard commodities that come into the country and those |  \\n|^|<|<| seized from market surveillance activities. As a result, warehouses in the Bureau were filled with substandard |  \\n|^|<|<| products that were not yet destroyed. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Procurements amounting to UGX.1.32Bn that were initiated during the financial year had not been completed by |  \\n|^|<|<| the close of the financial year.

The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery. I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations 10.  Uganda (UDC).

Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices. Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 11\\\\.

Failure to budget for NTR implies that there was no target upon which the Authority’s performance could be evaluated. Out of the total warrants received of UGX.28.3Bn during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling UGX.25.36Bn resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2.94Bn representing an absorption level of 90%, consequently some activities were either partially or not implemented at all, which negatively impacts service delivery. The Authority did not maintain a detailed risk register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets, as a result, there were no strategies and officers responsible for mitigating such risks or minimizing the impact in the event these risks materialized. Most pieces of land measuring approximately 11,931.343 hectares held by the entity were recorded in the entity land/assets register. However, 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 14.407 hectares were not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. The entity has outstanding payables of UGX.3.596Bn in the statement of financial position, a decrease by UGX.1.1140Bn from UGX.4.736Bn reported in the previous financial year. Although there was a decrease in domestic arrears, the entity accumulated new domestic arrears of UGX.966.425Mn. Continued accumulation of domestic arrears is contrary to the commitment control system of government, and also exposes government to risks of costly litigation. The authority had receivables of UGX.21.396Bn in the statement of financial position relating to rent, the sale of goods and services and administrative fees at the end of the financial year, a reduction by UGX.50.589Mn (0.24%) 12\\\\.

Understaffing negatively affects service delivery.

However, management did not open a separate bank account for the project as required by the Grant Agreement (Clause 5.6) and Chapter 13 of UEGCL’s Finance Regulations Manual. Co-mingling of grant funds with other funds makes them susceptible to misuse, and it renders it difficult to easily ascertain the accuracy of the project balances. In the period under review, I noted that the absorption of budgeted funds was only NOK.2.274m of the budgeted NOK.30.278m, representing a 7.5% absorption level. Low funds absorption leads to delayed implementation of critical project activities, which may hinder project effectiveness. 3\\\\.

The unspent balance majorly relates to uncompleted works (progress at 68%) for the Multi- Purpose building for cancer treatment and research. I noted the following anomalies regarding the construction of the Multipurpose building for which Roko Construction Ltd was the contractor: o o o o o Roko’s contract expired on 30th December 2020 and the Bank objected to any further extensions.  Management cashed the performance bond of UGX8bn after Roko Construction failed to perform as per contract Inconsistencies in the valuation of completed works between Certificates 6 and 7 with Certificate 6 dated 7th September 2021 having the total value of certified works as USD.10,136,181 and Certificate 7 dated 24th May 2022 having a total value of works completed being USD.9,691,293 hence a decrease in the value of works of USD 444,887. An overpayment to Roko of USD.82,444. UCI did not claim for liquidated damages amounting to USD.68,137.4 from Roko Construction Limited even after the Institute became aware of Roko’s failure to deliver the contract. The consultant had been paid USD.913,983 (95%) of the contract sum yet the progress of construction works that the consultant was supervising was only 69% as at 30th June 2022. The contract for consultancy services for the design and construction supervision expired in April 2020 and had never been renewed. By 30.06.22, a total of USD.851,608 (80% of the contract sum) was paid to M/S MFI document solutions for the supply of ICT and Telemedicine Equipment. However, by at the time of the audit, the ICT equipment had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the KCB bank performance guarantee presented by the supplier to the institute expired on 31/03/2022. There is a risk of loss of funds A total of USD.483,000 (20% of the contract sum) was advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, at the time of the audit the MRI scanner had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the Stanbic Bank performance guarantee IG21293UG0101204 presented by the supplier to the Institute expired on 18th October 2022. USD.176,600 (20%) had been advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of Laboratory Furniture but at the time of the audit, the furniture had not yet been delivered. |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n\\n\\n533\\n\\n---\\n\\n| \\uf0b7 I noted that the project staff were paid salaries to the tune of UGX.287,225,467 and UGX.83,170,756 was deducted as PAYE out of which UGX.31,289,385 was remitted resulting in to an under remittance of UGX.51,881,371. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 7\\\\.

I noted that, as at 30th September 2022, the digitalized system for verification of outputs and invoicing which had been rolled out by the Ministry to all the 131 districts was being utilised by only 98% of the districts to verify outputs and generate invoices. |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 Despite the significant contribution of URMCHSIP to the mandate of the health sector and bearing in mind that the project |  \\n|^|<|<| interventions will be closing by 31st December 2022 and finally end by June 2023, measures have not been put in place by |  \\n|^|<|<| the Ministry to guide the sustainable financing of the project interventions after close of project. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 A local firm was contracted in June 2022 to develop a Birth and Death and Adoption Orders Registration System (BDAR) |  \\n|^|<|<| through NIRA.

However, although the plan was submitted to National Planning Authority (NPA) it had not yet been certified by the time of reporting. There is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/21 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/21 and noted that although the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.1.95Bn during the year under review, only UGX.1.58Bn was collected resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.37bn (representing under performance of 18.97% of the target). Shortfalls in NTR collections affect the implementation of planned activities at Government wide level. UCI budgeted to receive UGX.37.76Bn out of which UGX.37.11Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.65Bn (representing 1.72% of the budget). Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX. 82,520,767 were irregularly reallocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Unauthorized reallocation of funds is not 8\\\\.

Funds to the tune of UGX.161,782,565 meant for contract staff salaries were reallocated and spent on permanent staff salary payments without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. A review of the Hospital’s NTR records revealed that the Accounting Officer waived off Radiography fees worth UGX.35,610,000 during the year under review. However, there was no policy in place to guide management on waivers. These waivers can be abused. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 9\\\\.

Two (2) land titles for land measuring approximately 1.259ha were not transferred into the names and custody of the Uganda Land Commission contrary to the Treasury Accounting Instructions. The Hospital’s Procurement and Disposal Unit which is supposed to have two (2) staff, according to the approved staff establishment, has only one (1) staff in post handling all procurement duties. This can lead to internal control overrides. During inspection of the Hospital Stores, I observed that the storage area was small and medicines were congested with the medicines on the floors instead of pallets and boxes leaning onto the walls. In addition, the store was not well lit and was poorly ventilated. Fourteen (14) tracer drugs selected experienced stock-outs ranging from 42 to 312 days. Stock-outs erode patients’ confidence in the public health care system, which compels them to seek inappropriate and expensive alternative health care services elsewhere. Management experienced delays of up to 54 days in delivery of medicines and sundries to the hospital by National Medical Stores. Examination of end-of-year stock balances for essential medicines revealed that some of the drugs had expired \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 11\\\\.

Failure to have timely approval of the strategic plan by the NPA leads to non-alignment of the operational plans with the strategic plan which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives. \\uf0b7 |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/21 and noted that |  \\n|^|<|<| the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX. 234,656,317 during the year under review.

Therefore, UGX.119,352,684 was paid to the suppliers in excess of the outstanding amounts. Despite the fact |  \\n|^|<|<| that UGX.119,352,684 was paid to three providers in excess of their outstanding domestic arrears, five suppliers with arrears |  \\n|^|<|<| totalling to UGX.102,668,097 were not paid. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The hospital structure has 349 approved positions.

The hospital lacked a neurosurgeon to build the capacity of the emergency |  \\n\\n\\n536\\n\\n---\\n\\n||<|<| services and reduce unnecessary referrals. Inadequate staffing undermines the achievement of strategic objectives and affects |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<| service delivery. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I noted that the information system at the hospital is manual and there is no linkage between the point of admission of a |  \\n|^|<|<| patient, to treatment, laboratory, pharmacy, billing, payment and finally discharge as there are no patient records and as such |  \\n|^|<|<| it is difficult to confirm completeness of the fees billed since the current system cannot completely and quickly show the |  \\n|^|<|<| services consumed by a particular patient. Failure to integrate the systems leads to loss of revenue as it is difficult to quickly |  \\n|^|<|<| establish the services different patients have consumed, paid for, and those that have not been paid for. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 There was a continued challenge concerning inadequate ward space especially for the Pediatrics, inpatient care for |  \\n|^|<|<| malnourished children, new born care and isolation of patients with contagious diseases.

I noted that in June 2021 and October 2021, they were paid 52 days and 45 days after the closure of the months. Delayed payment of salaries leads to demotivation of the affected staff as well as accumulation of salary arrears.\\n\\n- An over and/or under remittance amounting to UGX.248,991,771 and UGX.1,544,347 respectively were noted during comparison of the deductions in the IPPS payroll registers with the remittances/payments in the IFMS details XML payment file.\\n\\n- Net variances of UGX.56,622,986 between the IPPS payroll registers and interface files availed to the entity by the core FTP system. This creates an opportunity for manipulation and misappropriation of salary funds and could also lead to over/under payments of salary\\n\\n- The Hospital did not maintain IPPS pension registers nor did it maintain IPPS verification reports for their pension staff. As a result, I was unable to analyse their pension and gratuity payroll with the payments executed in IFMS\\n\\n- The Hospital did not include Hospital Management Board Member’s retainer fees of UGX.19,200,000 in the computation of PAYE leading to under deduction of PAYE of UGX.5,760,000. Omission of commissioner’s gratuity from the computation of PAYE leads to understatement of payables and receivables.\\n\\n- The Hospital received off budget financing to a tune of UGX.2,692,383,900, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by the law. These funds were received directly from Ministry of Health and development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public Finance Management Act.\\n\\n- Although UGX.843,109,684 from other government units was reported as part of the project balances in the memorandum statement for project balances on page 47 to financial statements, they it was not appropriated by Parliament and were not part of the budget. Inadequate disclosures may give room to misuse of funds.\\n\\n- Out of budgeted total revenue of UGX.12,359,383,661 for the year 2021/2022, UGX.12,357,633,660 (99%) was realized.\\n\\n- Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.12,357,633,660, UGX.12,229,767,057 (99%) was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.127,866,603 (1%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. The funds that were not absorbed were meant for the part payment of supply of an assortment of orthopedic equipment and accessories. I noted that while the equipment was delivered, it was not paid because the hospital administrator rejected some accessories valued at UGX.5,900,000.\\n\\n- The budgets for 2 of the 12 outputs assessed were not supported by costings/budgets for each of the activities within these outputs. I was therefore unable to confirm if the funds allocated for these out-puts were reasonable and justifiable.\\n\\n- Arua Regional Referral Hospital structure lacked over 69 positions that were prerequisite to the full operationalization of a referral hospital. The Hospital was operating on a staffing structure established in 1996 when the hospital was still operating as a District hospital. The structure had not been updated to match its new status as a regional referral hospital. As a result,\\n\\n539\\n\\n---\\n\\nwhile the hospital staffing level stood at 77.3%, several critical staff could not be recruited and absorbed leaving several departments understaffed\\n\\n- Several inadequacies in vital equipment like infant warmers, patient monitors, operating beds and headlamps among others were observed. There were also cases of stock outs of vital accessories needed to operationalize some medical equipment like batteries, distilled water for incubators, tubes for infusion pumps among others. The theatre also lacked several complementary equipment like cupboards needed to store sterilized equipment and accessories, drums for sterile equipment, mayo trays, operating stools, weighing scales etc.\\n\\n- Maintenance works were hampered because of lack of ready spare parts for some medical equipment such as the Auto Clave machines. Some equipment was too old or damaged beyond repair for example operating lights in the Gynecology Theatres.\\n\\n- The x-ray duo-diagnostic heavy-duty machine was non-functional, idle and redundant. The machine needed updating of software yet the service provider’s contract had expired. Idle and redundant medical equipment denies services to the patients and the equipment may be rendered obsolete over time.\\n\\n- The hospital had non-functional medical equipment eg Weighing scales – infants, Ultra scanners, Infusion Pump etc. Non- functioning equipment denies services to the patients and the equipment may be rendered obsolete over time.\\n\\n- During Inspections, it was noted that the hospital the structure was old, non-maintained, without sanitation facilities, no heavy duty staff gloves and therefore exposing staff to infections, had inadequate detergents, no flat iron, basins and buckets for carrying machine washed clothes and no uniforms and seats for staff.\\n\\n- The Oxygen plant was non-functional and hospital was relying on the oxygen supplied by NMS and therefore affecting the hospital drugs budget. No proper storage for both empty and filled cylinders. Cylinders were scattered on the ground exposing them to theft and explosions. Although the daily oxygen production is documented to be 30 cylinders per day, there was no proper distribution system to respective ward/s users in terms of requisitions and dispatch exposing the cylinders to the risk of black market.\\n\\n- The Pediatric Ward The ward has capacity of 40 beds but on average accommodates 90 children making others to sleep on the floor as shown in the picture. No trolleys for equipment and drugs, No wheel chairs. 3 oxygen concentrators function out of 6.\\n\\n- Doors and windows broken without locks and therefore exposing patient and staff to risk of theft. Poor hygiene was also noticed in toilets and bathrooms due to their non-functionality.\\n\\n- The maternity ward had Inadequate leading floor cases during the peak hours, Inadequate sanitary facilities, one toilet and bathroom supporting an average of 100 women on in the ward, Maternity had 6 deliveries but the minimum required beds are 10,the drainage system for the sluicing room was blocked and non-functional.\\n\\n- Gynae Theatre’s cupboards had rusted and hence exposing the medical tools to contaminations, no trolleys, no fridge, and no anaesthetist for operations.\\n\\n540\\n\\n---\\n\\n| Orthopaedic Workshop was adequately equipped and staffed. It lacked the following materials for operations; Polypropylene for making sockets, Eva Foams for making soft inserts, Pop powder for fabrication of devices, Knee Joint for Artificial limbs and Components for fabricating the limbs Hospital Lagoon’s fence was vandalized due to the absence of security and as a result manhole covers have been stolen and the community was using the land for grazing. Arua Regional Referral Hospital private wing did not have an approved work plan and budget for the financial year 2019/2020.The strategic plan and budget is supposed to guide the budgeting process by creating integrated link with the general hospital annual work plans which feed into the budget to ensure effective service delivery and achievement of their vision, mission and objectives. The hospital did not maintain a detailed risk register for all risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. As such, there were no strategies and officers responsible to mitigate the occurrence of such risks or to minimize the impact in the event that these risks materialized. The failure to maintain risk registers implies that the entity does not have a mitigation or response strategy to risks that may affect the achievement of planned activities.

I further noted that out of the USD 2,610,101 (UGX. 9,479,082,377) received, the project only utilised USD 2,577,021 (UGX. 9,362,167,833) leaving a balance of USD 33,080 (UGX 116,914,544 ). The low release of funds coupled with under absorption of funds implies unrealistic over budgeting.

I further noted that the remaining project funds are insufficient to complete the project due to cost escalations. Under the circumstances, the project is exposed to a risk of incomplete projects and unpaid obligations at project closure. The Italian Government delayed to disburse the second installment which affected the execution of the civil works under the initial contract. The Ministry of Health provided USD 1,304,322.96 (earlier meant for the procurement of x-rays) to the project to keep the works going. Upon receipt of the 2nd release from the Italian Government in December 2017, USD 1,276,847 was refunded leaving a balance of EUROs 22,302.24 outstanding to date. I informed management that delayed refund of internally borrowed monies negatively affects the delivery of the Ministry’s planned outputs. The Ministry of Health engaged a foreign firm to construct 68 staff houses at selected Health Centre IIIs in 9 Karamoja Districts at USD 5,592,885. The contract period was 18 months and a sum of USD 1,118,577 was advanced to the contractor on 16th June 2016. However, due to delayed payments by the Ministry arising from delayed release of funds by both the Italian Government and GoU co-funding, works stalled in 2018 and eventually the contractor abandoned the sites. I noted that at the time when the sites were abandoned, USD 415,025.48 had been recovered by the Ministry against the advance leaving a balance of USD 703,551.56. On the other hand, works valued at USD 315,827.87 had been certified. The contractor sued the Ministry for breach of contract. Whereas a reconciliation statement was prepared by the project consultant and shared with the contractor, the latter insisted that the Ministry settles the outstanding amount of USD 315,827.87.

Opinion |<|<| \\uf0b7 Out of the total actual receipts of EUR 4,199,750 a sum of EUR 3,691,785.65(88%) had been utilised by 30th June 2022 implying an under absorption of 12% of the total project grant. At the end of the financial year, the project closed with a cash and cash equivalent of EUR 530,266.59. \\uf0b7 Whereas the contracts for Lot 1 and Lot 2 were meant to be completed on 16th May 2021, only Lot 1 sites had been handed over and commissioned by end of FY 2021/2022. This implies delays for Lot 2 of 17 months from the planned completion date of 16th May 2021. By December 2022, the sites had not been completed. |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 In addition, Lot 3 had not yet started thereby occasioning significant delays on this lot 3 and the entire project. |  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n| \\uf0b7 I noted that out of the expected receipts of USD.8,643,589.75, the project received funding totalling USD.8,579,596.82 constituting USD.7,769,470.24 from external sources and USD.810,126.58 (UGX. 2,880,000,000) from GoU counterpart Kayunga Yumbe Hospital Project (KAYUP) FYT  June 2021 24. |<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n549\\n\\n---\\n\\n| contribution. Therefore, a budget shortfall of USD.135,657.97 (representing 1.7% of the external funding approved budget) was registered. This has a negative effect on the timely delivery of the planned outputs achievement of project objectives. \\uf0b7 Whereas the contract for the supply of medical and Hospital furniture worth USD 1,999,854.56 was initiated in the FY 2018/2019, deliveries had not yet been made by close of the year under review (30th June 2021). In addition, the performance guarantee had expired. Under the circumstances, the intended service delivery is compromised. In addition, the expiry of the bank guarantee exposes the Ministry of Health to a risk of a financial loss in the event that the company fails to deliver. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Three (3) Supplies contracts worth USD 2,582,573.121 for the supply of laboratory equipment had not performed by 30th June 2021 as planned thereby delaying the intended service delivery at both Kayunga and Yumbe hospitals. Failure to ensure timely execution of the project supplies contracts impacts negatively on the achievement of the primary objective of the project of contributing to the delivery of the Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package (UNMHCP), through improvement of health infrastructure at the two hospitals. During the year under review, the project planned, under component 3, to procure six (6) vehicles (2 Ambulances, 2 mini- buses and 2 pickups) for the two hospitals. Draft contracts were prepared and submitted to the Funds for final approval. However, approval of Draft contracts by the Development funders was yet to be obtained and accordingly clearance from the Solicitor General had not been sought by 30th June 2021. Under the circumstances, the intended project outputs were not attained thereby delaying planned service delivery at the two (2) hospitals. There were delays by the Funding Agencies in effecting payments due to Contractors and Suppliers for services offered to the project. This led to failure to pay project obligations on time resulting into accrued outstanding obligations of USD 2,361,491.08 of which USD 1,558,909.95 was related to unpaid interim certificates for civil works, USD765,581.13 due to equipment suppliers and USD 3,700 in respect of unpaid Project staff salaries. Low disbursement rate exposes the project to a risk of loss of funds due to unfavourable foreign exchange fluctuations. Furthermore, the project is at risk of having incomplete project components and litigations due to unpaid obligations at project closure. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 25\\\\.

In the court ruling dated 4th October 2021, a garnishee order for refund of UGX.444,400,000 was issued against the respondent and the bank jointly and, or severally. I further noted that costs of the application were awarded to Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council (the Applicant). During the year under review, management made the necessary adjustments to the financial statements in the form of a receivable of UGX 444,400,000 and further disclosed a contingent asset in the form of interest and costs of the application. By the end of the year under review, funds were yet to be recovered as per the court ruling. On 3rd July 2020, management fixed a sum of UGX. 4,370,100,000 (UGX 4,000,000,000 and USD 100,000) with Standard Chartered Bank for 6 months with approval of the Governing Council vide resolution No. 11 under minute Ref: FC/16/26/06/2020 of the 7th full Council Virtual meeting held on 24th, 25th and 26th June 2020.

This can lead to complacency and |  \\n|^|<|<| compromise standards of health practitioners thus affecting the lives of patients. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 I noted that the council has an approved staff establishment of 28 positions. However, only 16 positions (representing 57%) were filled leaving 12 positions (43%) vacant. Under the circumstances, the existing staff are exposed to a risk of job-related stress which could negatively affect service delivery. Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners council had four (4) motor vehicles. The council did not have a policy on Motor Vehicle Management to guide the usage of its fleet of four (4) vehicles so as to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse. None of the four (4) vehicles owned by the council was inspected during the year under review. Under the circumstances, there is a risk of unforeseen mechanical failures that would expose the users of such vehicles to road accidents. I noted that the three (3) drivers employed by the Council had not undertaken additional training to obtain additional skills and were not subjected to annual medical examination to ascertain their fitness to drive.

This state of affairs affects the implementation of planned project activities which ultimately leads to delayed service delivery. There was a delay in the refurbishment of Busolwe General Hospital whose proposed scope was estimated to cost USD 5,532,792.38. This is despite the fact that the consultant so far has been paid EUROs 155,108 since December 2017. Delayed implementation of the project activities and disbursement of funds attracts commitment charges. In addition, these delays may result into cost overruns on the entire project. \\uf0b7 30\\\\.

Although the hospital had an established staffing level of 889 only 296(33%) positions were filled leading to an understaffing of 585 (67%). Although the Hospital deployed two (2) information systems (Integrated Hospital Management Information System and Open Electronic Medical record system) they did not have any automated interface mechanisms to share information (integrated).

The Institute did not have land titles for the four (4) pieces of Land under its use. I further established that apart from Kamwanyi land measuring about 1.416 hectares and the UVRI Headquarters land measuring about 29.137 hectares, management was not certain of the size of the land in Arua and at Zika Forest. Lack of Land titles could result into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land. The reported payables of UGX.202,811,084 relating to property tax that the Institute owes Entebbe Municipal Council have been outstanding since FY 2010/11.

There is need for management to ensure data integrity and completeness during decommissioning. |  \\n| Out of the NTR estimate of UGX.6Bn, the Institute realized UGX.6.485Bn representing a performance of 108% of the target hence the need for the Institute to review its revenue targets. Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.29.216Bn, only UGX.28.873Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.343Bn (representing an absorption level of 98.8%). As a result, I noted that of the 37 quantified activities worth UGX.14.365Bn assessed; 18 activities (49%) were fully implemented, 18 activities (49%) were partially implemented while 1(one) activity remained unimplemented. I observed that land measuring 4.0470 hectares owned by the entity in Naguru had been encroached upon. Encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the land and pose a risk of loss of land. UGX.2,429,618,348 was assessed by URA as outstanding tax obligation (PAYE) arising from wrong deduction of taxes from professional allowances at 6% instead of 30% as per sec 19 (1) a of the Income Tax Act. Management has started implementing the tax rates but it has resulted into low morale with some professional employees leaving the Institute which may in the long run affect its ability to effectively deliver on its mandate. I noted that UHI has a Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) for patient management and other ancillary services in the OPD, Theatre, Cath Lab, IPD, Lab and other ancillary services. Despite the fact that the system is meant to share information to aid the smooth running of the entity, the system operates in isolation of other systems such as IFMIS and Human Capital Management (HCM) system of Ministry of Public Service. This leads to duplications and inefficiencies I observed that there were no factory trainings conducted for users and engineers (technicians) for some of the equipment procured by the Institute which makes the equipment susceptible to breakdown and prolonged down time. I noted that some vital medical equipment was inadequate according to the bio-medical department analysis and recommendation, while others were due for replacement. This compromises the level of service to patients Out of the 10 (ten) items selected as tracer Essential Medicines at the Institute, three (3) experienced stock-outs ranging from 40 to 45 days. In addition, the Institute had some expired medicine which had no designated holding area; and were kept together with medicines still under use. This poses a high risk to the patients. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 40\\\\. Uganda Heart Institute. Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 41\\\\.

In addition, the amount was not disclosed in prior periods implying that they were not verified and reconciled with the balances on the database maintained by the Accountant General’s Office. Records for expenditure worth UGX.1,041,373,039 were missing on file at the time of audit. Pension and Gratuity worth UGX.387,436,568 was not paid to fifteen (15) pensioners and retirees. Out of the total warrants of UGX.74.580bn received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling UGX.72.183Bn resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2.394Bn representing an absorption level of 96.8%. Recruitments of staff were thus not undertaken as funds were released late in May 2022. I assessed the implementation of a sample of eight (8) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX.50.683bn and noted that seven (7) outputs with thirteen (13) activities and expenditure worth UGX.45.883bn were fully implemented while One (1) output with one (1) activity worth 4.8bn was partially implemented. Funds to the tune of UGX.1,177,688,181 were diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.

However, management did not avail documentation to confirm the size, date and cost of acquisition, ownership and the location of the land. Similarly, the Hospital did not have Land titles for 22 pieces of land whose size the hospital could not ascertain. Six (6) pieces of land whose hectares and value could not be established due to management’s inability to avail the information had encumbrances in the form of caveats, court injunctions and encroachment. Similarly, some entities on the land had obtained title deeds without the consent/approval of the Hospital. For a sample of 463 key medical equipment in the Hospital, I noted that 46 were non-functional, 4 semi-functional and 413 are functional. In 2019, the Ministry of Health installed RX Solution, an electronic pharmaceutical management system in the stores with the objective of automatically submitting data to the MoH PIP system for stock status reporting. However, although the RX solutions had been installed on the Hospital computers in the store it was not being used by the stores staff. Hospital has six (6) systems which were not integrated and not automatically sharing information with other systems. As such, information sharing was purely manual despite being explicitly provided for in the respective system requirements. Direct procurements worth UGX.571,826,881 were undertaken by the Hospital without justification while a total of UGX.777,307,880 procurements were irregularly undertaken during the year. |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 43\\\\.

As a result, I noted that out of the 19 quantified activities worth UGX.7.309Bn assessed; 7 activities representing 37% were fully implemented while 12 activities representing 63% were partially implemented. On 31st March 2015, Butabika Hospital Management Board permitted the Commission together with four (4) other government entities to utilise three acres of Butabika Hospital land on a lease to construct office premises. However, by close of the year under review, no action had been taken by the Commission despite its current substantial annual rent expenses of UGX.680,000,000. I noted that although the Board of Survey recommended twenty-seven (27) IT equipment valued at UGX.63,300,000 for decommissioning in the financial year 2021/22, no disposals had been made. Out of 79 positions only 52 are filled leaving 27 positions vacant. 44\\\\. Health Service Commission. 2021/22 Unqualified Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n| 45\\\\.

The Commission received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX. 939,268,646 which was not declared to Treasury and therefore not appropriated by Parliament  Although UAC did not budget to collect NTR during the year under review UGX.40,180,000 was collected as NTR. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 I reviewed the implementation of nine (9) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of forty-four (44) activities worth |  \\n|^|<|<| UGX.14.55Bn and noted that the reported performance at activity level was not aligned with the planned performance. As a |  \\n|^|<|<| result, it was difficult to assess the level of implementation of the planned out puts. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 UGX.13,347,458 was irregularly diverted from workshops and seminars code and spent on staff lunch without seeking and |  \\n|^|<|<| obtaining the necessary approvals. |  \\n|^|<|<| \\uf0b7 The entity had reported payables of UGX.76,162,182 which have been accumulating since July 2005. |  \\n| \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Out of the UGX.243.62Bn total funds available for spending, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48Bn representing 87% under absorption. The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery. I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations \\uf0b7 The Corporation has been holding 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 6.932 hectares without land titles for a long time without justification, exposing the corporation to the risk of loss of land thru land grabbing and encroachment. Unqualified 46\\\\. Ministry of Health. Opinion |<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n560\\n\\n---\\n\\n| Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices. Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 |<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| LEGISLATURE |<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|^|  \\n| I noted that the bank reconciliations from June 2021 to September 2021 were not correctly done. There were un-reconciling differences between the cashbook and the bank statement balances. In addition to this, the bank reconciliations provided for my review lacked evidence of review and approval by senior management. I noted that the project field staff allowances were not charged PAYE tax. Non-compliance with Income Tax Act may precipitate tax penalties from Uganda Revenue Authority, leading to financial loss for the project. I noted quarterly reports were not submitted to CDC on time. Late submission of reports may delay reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the project by the development partners. \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 Parliamentary  Pension Scheme. Unqualified 1.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT**\\n\\n### Qualified Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral\\n\\n## Hospital, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 30 th June 2020, the\\n\\nstatement of financial performance, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows, together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\n#### In my opinion, except for the financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital for the year ended 30 th June 2020 are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 and the Financial Reporting\\n\\nGuide, 2018.\\n\\n### The basis for Qualified Opinion\\n\\n### Mischarge of Expenditure\\n\\n#### A review of the payment file revealed that the Hospital charged expenditure of UGX.157,809,531 on expenditure item code 211103 (Allowances) to pay locally contracted staff salaries and their corresponding statutory deductions instead of charging Budget expenditure Item of 211102 (Contract staff salaries) resulting in a mischarge as shown in\\n\\n### Appendix 1.\\n\\n#### Mischarging of expenditure undermines the importance of the budgeting process and controls as well as the intentions of the appropriating Authority.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that in the effective financial year 2019/20 when\\n\\n#### Appropriation in Aid (AIA) was removed from the PBS, all contract staff salaries were transited to the item of General staff allowances. However, evidence of supporting guidance from the Accountant General was not availed for audit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Key Audit Matters\\n\\n#### Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters\\n\\nwere addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in\\n\\n#### forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below as the key audit matters to be\\n\\ncommunicated in my report:\\n\\n### 1.0 Budget Performance\\n\\n**Implementation of Budget approved by Parliament**  \\nEvery year, the government plans and allocates funds to MDAs for the implementation of activities that would enable the country to attain sustainable\\n\\n## development. I observed that MDAs have challenges with regard to the\\n\\nimplementation of planned activities, which negatively affects service delivery and improvement of the people’s wellbeing. As a result, the implementation of the approved budget was considered a key audit matter and during the office-wide\\n\\n## planning, I identified risks common with MDAs which include; non-implementation of\\n\\nstrategic plans, the underperformance of revenue, implementation of off-budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.\\n\\n#### Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital caters for the nine districts within the Rwenzori Region which include, Kabarole, Kasese, Bundibugyo, Kamwenge, Ntoroko, Kyegegwa, Kyenjojo and Kitagwenda. The catchment area also covers the western Kibaale district and the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\n#### To achieve this mandate, the Hospital planned to implement a number of both recurrent and development deliverables under various programmes. A review of the\\n\\nentity’s policy statement and budgets revealed that the Hospital had an approved\\n\\n## budget of UGX.10,327,114,481, out of which UGX.9,971,835,985 was released.\\n\\n#### The Hospital planned to achieve its deliverables through the implementation of nineteen (19) outputs with a budget of UGX.3, 603,521,255. I sampled seven (7) outputs with a total expenditure of UGX.2,892,563,861 representing 55% of the\\n\\navailable resources.\\n\\n| **SN** | **Key Out-put** | **Amount** **UGX** **spent** | **% of the amount spent to a total of expenditure for key items implemented** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | Payment for gratuity and pension for the hospital | 920,233,260 | 32.% |  \\n| 2 | Supply of solar light and installation | 39,500,000 | 1% |  \\n| 3 | Consultancy  for development of E-stores for Private wing services | 22,860,000 | 0.7% |  \\n| 4 | Renovation of room the laundry | 14,000,000 | 0.4% |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 5 | Supply of mattresses with Pvc cover | 40,000,000 | 1% |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 6 | construction of perimeter wall fence | 1,637,970,601 | 57% |  \\n| 7 | Supply of Ultra sound machine and dental chairs | 218,000,000 | 8% |  \\n| **Cumulative total and % of key outputs/activities** |<| **2,892,563,861** | **100** |  \\n\\n\\nThe outbreak of the Covid Pandemic affected the implementation of the 2019/20 budget especially activities in the last half of the financial year. As a result, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic.\\n\\n## From the procedures undertaken, I noted the following:\\n\\n| **No** | **Observation** |<|<|<|<|<| **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1.1 | **Implementation of the Strategic Plan**  The overall Government National Development Plan (NDP II) expired at the end of FY 2019/20. In line with the NDP II, Fort portal Referral Hospital had an approved strategic plan for the period 2017/18 -2019/20, which set out both the long-term and short-term targets to be achieved during the duration of the strategic plan. being the last year of implementation of the Hospital’s strategic plan, I conducted an assessment of the achievement of the Hospital’s strategic targets/goals. noted at the time of the audit (August 2020) that out of the planned seven(7) strategic targets/goals, five (5) targets had been fully achieved, while two (2) were partially achieved as indicated in the below and **Appendix II:** The extent of Achievement of 2015/16-2019/2020 Strategic plan by** **2019/2020**  No Level of performance by end  of 2019/2020 No  of strategic goals/ objectives % of the total number of strategic objectives 5 0 2 **7** 71% 0 29% **100** Fully achieved Partially achieved Not achieved **Total** Source:** **4 th** Quarter Program budgeting System** un achieved targets include: Construction of the perimeter wall Renovation of the laundry area \\uf0b7  \\uf0b7  **Details are in appendix II**  The Accounting Officer explained that the underperformance was due to the fact that some projects were to be implemented for over 3 year period.

The revenue performance was UGX.14,823,640 over and above the budgeted The Accounting Officer attributed over performance to the direct revenue deposits to the NTR Account from Institutions that do their internships at the Hospital. **Revenue Performance** Non Tax Revenue Performance** I |<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I commended the Accounting Officer for the  excellent performance. |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^| **Performance of GOU receipts**  The entity budgeted to receive UGX.

The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.  Under absorption of released funds results in non-implementation of planned activities and negates the purpose for which funds were disbursed.  The Accounting Officer attributed the unspent balance to the wage that was released for unfilled vacancies. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the relevant authorities and ensure vacant positions are filled. |  \\n| 1.4 | **Quantification of Outputs/Activities** noted that all the seven (7) sampled, All the seven (7) outputs sampled were fully quantified, as shown below and details are in **Appendix III.** I |<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I commended the Accounting Officer for this. |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **Table showing quantification of outputs/activities** Details  **No. of out puts** Activity details **Total**  **no**  **activiti** es** **of** **No. Fully Quant ified activit ies** **No.** Not fully Quantifi ed activitie s** **% activitie s quantifi ed** Fully quantified outputs Partially quantified outputs 1  Not Quantified Outputs  Total Sampled Outputs **7 0** **0** **7** 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 100 0 0 100 **Source: Program budgeting system budget** |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| **Implementation of Quantified out-puts**  I assessed the implementation of seven (7) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of seven activities and noted the following;  \\uf0b7 5 were fully implemented representing 71%  \\uf0b7 2 were partially implemented representing 29%.

I noted that the entity submitted performance reports for Q2 and Q4 after the deadline given for submission of the reports as indicated in the table below;  **Table showing submission of quarterly performance reports**  **No Details Deadline for** submission** 31/10/2019 **Actual** date of submission** 31/10/2019 **Comment (submitted in time/ delayed)** Quarter  N/A  One  Quarter  Two  Quarter  Three  Quarter  Four 31/01/2020 5 th /2/2020 System errors. 30/04/2020 30/04/2020 N/A 31/07/2020 15 th /8/2020 System errors. **Program budgeting system quarterly performance reports** to submit performance reports in time is not only contrary to the circular standing instructions it affects the timely evaluation of performance The Accounting Officer attributed the anomaly to system errors on PBS. 1 2 3 4 1.7 Failure |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| advised  the Accounting Officer to ensure always engage the PBS support desk of MOFPED for timely resolution of system challenges.

Key among these included supplementary funding to enable the\\n\\n## entities to respond to the threat and effects of the pandemic on Ugandans. In\\n\\naddition to the supplementary funding, the government encouraged citizens to make voluntary contributions to the State.\\n\\n## Because the response to the pandemic was emergent in nature, i.e. it was neither\\n\\nanticipated nor planned for, there was a risk that the entities that participated in this intervention may experience challenges in optimally applying the availed resource to\\n\\n---\\n\\n| **2.1** | The entity received a total of UGX 270,000,000 from different sources as summarised in the table below **Receipts from Treasury** **No. Details/Source** **1**  1.1 Supplementary allocation  **Sub Total**  **Sub Total** Total Receipts** **Amount (UGX)** budget  270,000,000 270,000,000 270,000,000 **Receipts and utilization of funds by the entity** **Receipts** |<|<|<|<||  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| **2.2** | **Absorption and utilization of funds**  According to letter Ref.ADM.105/309/23 of 27 th April 2020, Ministry of Health released UGX.270, 000,000 to the Hospital account to support the Regional Referral Hospital for COVID- 19 Pandemic in Coordination, Case Management in Isolation Unit, Infection Prevention and Control, Surveillance for alert Management and referral of Samples from the districts. The implementation was to be done in accordance with the approved work plan and accountability submitted as soon as the implementation is done.  I noted at the time of audit (August 2020), that out of the total receipts of UGX UGX.270, 000,000 the entity absorbed UGX.89,009,282 representing an absorption level of 33.%. leaving a balance of UGX 183,286,718 on the account. |<|<|<|<| advised the Accounting Officer to always spend funds as approved and on only eligible items I |  \\n| **2.3** | **Preparation and approval of work plans**  Paragraph 23 of the Budget Execution Circular 2019/20 requires that all supplementary budget requests must be supported by a realistic work plan and budget.  I noted that the entity prepared work plans to guide the utilization of funds that were received. |<|<|<|<| commended Accounting Officer I the |  \\n| **2.4** | **Accountability of funds** reviewed expenditure records availed and noted the following; \\uf0b7 \\uf0b7 I noted that funds amounting to UGX **22,855,500** were unaccounted for at the time of the audit **Appendix IV (a).**  I observed that accountabilities for funds amounting to UGX. **12,158,000** was lacking as shown in **Appendix IV (b).**  \\uf0b7 UGX 11,465,000 on unbudgeted for activities. Appendix V I Paragraph 10.10.1 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 requires that all payments must be adequately supported with sufficient details to enable them to be checked without reference to other documents. |<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all funds are accounted for. |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Other Matters\\n\\n## I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters others than those presented or\\n\\ndisclosed in the financial statements:\\n\\n**3.0**\\n\\n### Lack of a Functional Hospital Governing Board\\n\\nSection 3 of the Guidelines on Hospital Management Boards for referral Hospital 2003, mandates the Minister of Health to appoint members of Hospital Management\\n\\n## Boards to provide an oversight role in the management of the affairs of the regional\\n\\nreferral hospital. Section 4.3 (I) of the Guidelines on Hospital Management Boards\\n\\n#### for referral hospitals (2003) provides that the Board shall meet at least quarterly (3months) to conduct hospital business. However, during the audit, I noted that the Hospital was operating without a Board for almost 1 year which created gaps in\\n\\npolicy formulation. The absence of the Board slows down decision making and affects the efficiency and governance of the hospital leading to poor service delivery.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the matter was being addressed and further stated that out of the five districts, three districts had nominated names of their members.\\n\\n## I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the remaining two districts and ensure\\n\\nthat the Board is put in place.\\n\\n### 4.0 Hospital Private Wing\\n\\n**4.1**\\n\\n### Lack of an Approved Work plan and Budget in the Private Wing\\n\\n## Section 3 (1) of Ministry of Health guidelines for the management of private wings of\\n\\nhealth units in Uganda 2003, requires a private wing to develop comprehensive\\n\\n## strategic plans spanning a period of 3-5 years. Annual slices of these plans will be\\n\\ndeveloped every year as annual work plans or operational plans.\\n\\nSection 4.3.1 (Budgeting), of the same guidelines, stipulates that a private wing budget should be made for every financial year and all expenditures will be based on\\n\\n## this budget. This budget should mirror the different ledger categories/accounts\\n\\nmaking it easy to do budget monitoring and the making of financial reports related to the budget.\\n\\n## Contrary to the guidelines, the Hospital's private wing didn’t have an approved work\\n\\n---\\n\\nstructure should be made public by displaying on the hospital notice board and other strategic locations.\\n\\n## It was, however, noted that the private wing does not have a private wing\\n\\ncommittee and in effect no fee structure was set, approved by the board and no displays of fees structure on the notice board and strategic locations was done.\\n\\n## Lack of approved fee structure may lead to overcharging of patients.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the fee structure is available but pending approval by the Hospital Board.\\n\\n## I advised the Accounting Officer to set up a private wing Committee for the proper\\n\\nfunction of the private wing and ensure that the fee structure is approved.\\n\\n### 5.0 Under Staffing\\n\\n#### It was observed that the Hospital had an approved structure of 433 positions. However out of 433 positions only 310 (72%) positions were filled, leaving 123 (28%) positions including the senior positions of Consultants, senior procurement officer and an Accountant vacant. Understaffing leads to over load of the existing staff and undermines the delivery of services to the Community.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Hospital had continued to engage the relevant authorities by declaring the vacant posts.\\n\\n## I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up the matter with the relevant authorities\\n\\nand ensure that the vacant positions are filled.\\n\\n### Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries\\n\\n#### by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The Other Information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and I\\n\\ndo not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\n#### In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Hospital’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\n### Auditor General’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\n## My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as\\n\\na whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an\\n\\n## auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance\\n\\nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect\\n\\n## a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\\n\\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\n#### As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAI’s, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also: \\uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\\n\\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for\\n\\n## my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is\\n\\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design\\n\\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\\n\\n#### expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Hospital’s internal control. \\uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\\n\\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of\\n\\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\\n\\n#### exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Hospital’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am\\n\\nrequired to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the\\n\\n## financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My\\n\\nconclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s\\n\\n## report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Hospital to fail to deliver its\\n\\nmandate.\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,\\n\\n---\\n\\nthe adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n### Other Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on\\n\\n## my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised\\n\\nin compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n### Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\n## The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters\\n\\nare as follows;\\n\\n### 6.0 Fleet Management\\n\\n## The increasing demand for accountability and better management of public\\n\\nresources by various stakeholders in Uganda such as the Executive arm of\\n\\n#### Government, Parliament, Citizenry, Donors, and Civil Society, among others, has prompted the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) to select fleet management as one\\n\\nof the audit themes for the audit year 2020. The detailed motivation for the audit is because of the importance of Vehicles in response to National Emergencies and\\n\\n## General Delivery of Public Service, the executive's Concern on Management of\\n\\nGovernment Motor vehicles, the public outcry on the misuse of Government Vehicles\\n\\n#### and Government substantial expenditure on Purchase of Vehicles. Consequently, I developed specific audit procedures to Ascertain whether\\n\\ngovernment vehicles were;\\n\\n- Acquired in compliance with Government vehicle acquisition guidelines;\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Are comprehensively recorded in the assets register to ensure their proper\\n\\nmanagement;\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Are adequately allocated, operated and utilized to enable the delivery of public\\n\\nservice;\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Are properly and regularly maintained to achieve optimal performance, increased\\n\\nuseful lives and reduced running costs; and\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Are disposed in compliance with PPDA guidelines, and disposal proceeds properly\\n\\naccounted for.\\n\\n|| **Key Observations** | **Audit Recommendation/Comment** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| **6.0 6.1** | **ACQUISITION OF MOTOR VEHICLES**  **Funding**  During the three (3) financial years: 2017/18-2019/20; the Hospital did not plan to spend on the acquisition of vehicles from both project and Government funding Consequently, there were no funds spent on the acquisition of vehicles over the three (3) year period under review ||  \\n| **6.2 6.2.1** | **MOTOR VEHICLE RECORDING**  **Improper maintenance of Motor Vehicle Records**  I noted that the Hospital did not maintain an assets register to record all its vehicles | I advised the Accounting Officer to enforce the maintenance of proper  to achieve the desired safety and efficient utilization of the fleet. vehicle records |  \\n| **6.3** | **Un-updated Asset Management Module in the Financial Management system** | I advised the Accounting Officer |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n|| Paragraph 10.13.4 of the Tis, 2017 requires all fixed assets acquisitions to be captured in the fixed assets module of the Government Computerised Financial Management Information System (GFMIS).

This may lead to misstatement of assets recorded in the financial statements, and pause challenges the reconciliation of the fixed assets register using system information. in Accounting Officer explained that the office of Accountant General was already supporting the update of the register as required The |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| to ensure that the IFMS asset module is regularly updated to enable accurate recording of fixed assets financial statements, and maintenance of a comprehensive assets register. in the |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **6.4 6.4.1** | **MOTOR VEHICLE USAGE** Existence of a fleet management policy and** **guidelines**  I noted that the Hospital did not have a policy on Motor vehicle management to guide the usage and eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse of motor vehicles. This affects the entity’s ability to address its unique motor vehicle challenges which may not be envisaged in the standing Orders and Treasury Accounting Instructions. Accounting Officer explained that the Hospital uses log books, vehicle/transport request forms and gate passes in managing the fleet. And efforts were underway to consolidate the above good practices to develop guidelines and policies based on experience and prevailing circumstances in the Hospital with a view to proper fleet management. The |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to put in place a vehicle management policy streamlining usage of vehicles to eliminate wastage and misuse of vehicles. |  \\n| **6.5** | **Motor Vehicle allocation**  A review of the motor vehicle allocation to officers in the Hospital revealed no inappropriate allocation of vehicles. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I Commended the Accounting Officer |  \\n| **6.6** | **Support to Entity Service Delivery**  A review of the vehicle allocation to key service centers in the Hospital revealed that the patient's service unit was not adequately allocated vehicles as indicated in the table below; Reason Effects s for  inadequ  ate  allocati  on No. of vehic les alloc ated Type of vehicl es allocat ed Unit/Depar tment requiring vehicles S N Are allocat ed vehicle s adequ ate  and appro priate (YES/ NO)  1 Patient’s 02 No Service Not given Land cruise r Ambul ance Possible deaths due to delayed delivery of patience to hospital and other reference centers Inadequate allocation of vehicles the above departments/units affected the efforts of the unit, thus affecting the level of service delivery in regard to patient services.

This is an indication that the cost of vehicle maintenance is lower, and this is partly caused by negligence and poor management of the fleet as illustrated by the grounded vehicles. shown below; further noted that the hospital did not prepare maintenance work plans to guide its vehicle maintenance initiatives during the 3 years which may lead to haphazard maintenance activities that could lead to wasteful expenditure since costs are not monitored according to plans.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\\n\\n## Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Fortportal Regional Referral Hospital which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the financial statements of Fortportal Regional Referral Hospital for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n## Basis for Opinion\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of the Referral Hospital in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda.\\n\\nI have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n## Key Audit Matters\\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that in my professional judgment were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period.

Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the management of payroll.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a result, I considered payroll management a Key Audit Matter and identified crosscutting risks including; unrealistic budgeting for employees and pension costs, under absorption of wage funds, delayed access to the payroll, over payment of salaries, non-payment of salary and pension arrears, among others.\\n\\nI analyzed the approved budget and releases to Fortportal Regional Referral Hospital for salary, pension and gratuity in the period under review, as shown below;\\n\\n###### Table showing Breakdown of Fortportal Regional Referral Hospital Budget and\\n\\n**releases for the year**\\n\\n| Category | Initial Approved budget (UGX) | Revised budget (UGX) | Amount released (UGX) | %age funding received |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| Employee costs | 6,556,299,695 | 6,556,299,695 | 6,556,299,695 | 100 |  \\n| Pension | 447,026,120 | 447,026,120 | 447,026,120 | 100 |  \\n| **Total** | **7,003,325,815** | **7,003,325,815** | **7,003,325,815** | 100 |  \\n\\n\\nThe wage and Pension Pay roll of UGX.7,003,325,815 constituted 72% of the Hospital’s budget for 2020/2021 of UGX.9,672,051,841.\\n\\nI am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continued to significantly affect the implementation of payroll management activities.

However, the entity was coming up with an updated list of prequalified providers.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer was advised to always follow the procurement regulations and come up with a list of registered providers to guide procurements undertaken by the hospital.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer; the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer; and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n## Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Referral Hospital.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Referral Hospital’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Referral Hospital’s financial reporting process.\\n\\n## Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also;\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Referral Hospitals’ internal control.\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Referral Hospital’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Referral Hospital to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n## Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\nThere were no material findings in respect of compliance with legislation.\\n\\n![](assets_Fortportal%20Regional%20Referral%20Hospital%20Report%20FY20202021/img-2291.jpg)\\n\\nJohn F.S.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\\n\\n##### Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the financial statements of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital for the year ended 30 th June 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n##### Basis for Opinion\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n##### Key Audit Matters\\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\n\\nI have determined the matters described below as the key audit matters to be communicated in my report.\\n\\n##### 1.0 Payroll Management\\n\\nOver the years, Government has implemented several reforms in payroll management including the decentralization of salary, pension and gratuity payments. Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the payroll management in the Central Governments.\\n\\nDuring my audit of the previous financial year (2020/21), I undertook a comprehensive audit of payroll management in the Ministries, Departments and Local Governments, which revealed major challenges. The audit findings and my recommendations thereof are still being considered by various stakeholders.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn view of the previous year’s audit observations and the significance of the payroll to the overall Hospital budget (refer to table below), I again considered management of payroll in MDALGs with emphasis on payments and deductions as a Key Audit Matter to be communicated in my report.\\n\\nDuring the year under review (FY 2021/22), the Referral Hospital spent, UGX.7,313,161,543 on Salaries, Pension and Gratuity, representing 69.7% of the total expenditure of UGX.10,490,554,110 as detailed below;\\n\\n| **Account code** | **Particulars** | **Amount (UGX)** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 211101 | General Staff Salaries | 6,255,781,452 |  \\n| 212102 | Pension for General Civil Service | 580,751,550 |  \\n| 213004 | Gratuity Expenses | 476,628,541 |  \\n|| **Total** | **7,313,161,543** |  \\n\\n\\nI designed audit procedures to ascertain whether;\\n\\n- Funds for salaries, pension and gratuity were released and utilized as budgeted.\\n- Only eligible employees, pensioners and beneficiaries accessed the payrolls and were paid accordingly.\\n- Correct deductions were made from salaries and remitted to the rightful beneficiary institutions.\\n- The Referral Hospital complied with the established payroll management controls\\n- All salary, gratuity and pension transactions were correctly disclosed in the financial statements.\\n\\nBased on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;\\n\\n#### No Observations Recommendation\\n\\n**1.1**\\n\\n#### Funding and absorption of wage, pension and gratuity\\n\\nI reviewed the approved wage, pension and gratuity estimates for the I  \\nadvised the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the Hospital budgeted to Accounting Officer to receive UGX.7,728,337,572 during the year under review and received liaise with MoFPED to UGX.7,728,337,571 representing 100% performance.\\n\\n######### Table showing breakdown of Referral Hospital Budget and releases for the year\\n\\nensure that the required wage for recruitment of staff is released in the first **Category Approved Amount released %age funding** and second quarter.\\n\\n##### Estimates (UGX) (UGX) received\\n\\nSalary 6,562,523,830 6,562,523,830 100  \\nPension 581,962,593 581,962,593 100 I n addition, i advised Gratuity 583,851,149 583,851,148 100 the Accounting Officer **Total 7,728,337,572 7,728,337,571 100** to ensure that the Human Resource staff Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.7,728,337,571, support  \\nthe only UGX.7,313,161,543 was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent pensioners/beneficiarie balance of UGX.415,176,028, representing an under absorption level of s in starting the 5.4% as shown in the table below;  \\nprocess of exiting six months before the **Category Approved Releases/ Expenditure Unspent % absorption** retirement date.\\n\\n##### Estimates\\n\\n##### Warrant\\n\\n##### (A) (B) (C) (B-C)\\n\\n##### (UGX ’bns) (UGX ’bns) (UGX ’bns) (UGX\\n\\n**’bns)**\\n\\n---\\n\\n| Salary 6,255,781,452 95.33 Pension 6,562,523,83 0 581,962,593 6,562,523,83 0 581,962,593 Gratuity 583,851,149 583,851,148 580,751,550 476,628,541 **Total**  7,728,337,57 2 **7,728,337,5 71** **7,313,161,5 43** 306,742,3 78 1,211,043 107,222,6 07 **415,176 028** 99.79 81.64 **94.63** absorption of wages negatively affected the livelihood of staff/pensioners due to non-payment of their wage/pension benefits. he Accounting Officer explained that the extra wage was meant for recruitment. However due to enhancement of lunch allowance, the recruitment couldn’t be done immediately as wage analysis showed deficit. Supplementary wage was requested for but was received in the last month of the financial year. Furthermore, some gratuity files were not finalised due to validation issues. One planned file was not paid due to lack of letters of Administration. They have currently been processed and file is under process.

I I G |  \\n| **c)** | **Remittance of deductions (LST, PAYE, UNATU, UCLA)**  Section B-a (17) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 requires the Accounting Officer to deduct any monies due to Government from an Officer’s salary by way of statutory taxes like and any other authorized deductions. Furthermore, section B-a (18) requires that a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations may be deducted from his or her salary in accordance with the regulations. addition, section 10.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralized salary processing 2014 required MALGS to pay deductions to the respective beneficiaries and that no arrears in respect to payroll deductions would be accepted.

By, the final payroll should be mapped onto the interface to show the same data. compared the payroll registers (IPPS file) with the IFMS interface files and observed that there were variances of UGX.13,169,218. his creates an opportunity for manipulation and misappropriation of salary funds and could also lead to over/under payments of salary. he Accounting Officer explained that the hospital had no control over the issue, since IPPS system is managed and controlled by MoPS. The Accounting Officer further stated that the rollout of the Human Capital Management System (HCMS) by MoPS may resolve the challenges.

The supplier claimed to have ordered for the items from abroad but could not arrive in time for payments to be made. The funds were swept back. |  \\n| **2** | Wage | 306,742,378 | There was no recruitment done since the entity had received the supplementary for wage in last month of the year. |  \\n| **3** | Welfare | 76,727,825 | This was a supplementary for feeding Covid 19 patients and staff. This time Covid19 cases had reduced and the funds could not be utilized. |  \\n| **4** | Gratuity | 107,222,607 | There were no pending gratuity files to pay. |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure timely commencement of recruitment processes. In addition, the Accounting Officer should ensure that the Human Resource department supports prospective pensioners in preparation and submission of required documentation to access their pension benefits.\\n\\n**3.0**\\n\\n##### Lack of an Approved Work plan and Budget in the Private Wing\\n\\nSection 3 (1) of Ministry of Health guidelines for management of private wings of health units in Uganda 2003, requires a private wing to develop comprehensive strategic plans spanning a period of 3-5 years. Annual slices of these plans will be developed every year as annual work plans or operational plans.\\n\\nSection 4.3.1 (Budgeting), of the same guidelines stipulates that a private wing budget should be made for every financial year and all expenditures will be based on this budget. This budget should mirror the different ledger categories/accounts making it easy to do budget monitoring and making of financial reports related to the budget.\\n\\nContrary to the guidelines, the Hospital private wing didn’t have an approved work plan and budget for the financial year 2021/2022.\\n\\nIn the absence of a work plan and budget, there is a risk of abuse of Non Tax Revenue collected by the private wing.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer responded that when doing planning and budgeting for the hospital, non-tax revenue from the private wing is always incorporated in the main hospital budget and work plan. For the year under review, this was the case as well. However, management of the hospital deliberately decided to constitute a team of staff to develop the private wing policy, budget and work plan to guide the operations and general management of the private wing. The private wing policy, budget, and work plan is now available for the current year.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the private wing has a budget and work plans in place.\\n\\n**4.0**\\n\\n##### Outstanding Receivables at the private wing\\n\\nParagraph 4.0 of the Guidelines of management of Private wings of health units in Uganda, 2010 provides that private wings should be managed like business enterprises with clear separate transactions and identification of resource exchange between itself and the rest of the hospital.\\n\\nA review of the expenditure vouchers revealed that hospital management and board members consumed hospital services worth UGX.17,656,100 and only paid UGX.2,347,000 leaving a balance of UGX.15,209,100.\\n\\nFailure by staff to meet the medical bills results into loss revenue for the private wing and is a loss to Government.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that there were services and medicines prescribed for staff and these were not provided/supplied by the National Medical Stores since they were not on the essential drugs list of Government. The understanding was that this cost would be incurred by the hospital from the vote of staff health cost or\\n\\n---\\n\\nwelfare vote. However, the budgetary provision for such activities were always insufficient. However, management pledged to pay as and when resources were made available.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the services offered are fully paid for.\\n\\n##### Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The Other Information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n##### M anagement’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the PFMA, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital (RRH).\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters affecting ability to deliver its mandate for the foreseeable future, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\n##### Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAI’s, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for\\n\\n---\\n\\nmy opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the RRH’s internal control.\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on RRH’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the RRH to fail to deliver its mandate.\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n##### Other Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n##### Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\nThe material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;\\n\\n**5.0**\\n\\n##### Expired advance payment security\\n\\n---\\n\\nRegulation 47(4) (C) of PPDA (Contract) regulations, 2014 states that A payment security shall be valid for a prescribed period beyond the expected final date of completion of a contract or expected release date.\\n\\nContrary to the above, advance payment of UGX.215,265,000 was made to Prutaz Construction and vocational training Ltd in the contract for construction of a perimeter wall fence against an advance payment guarantee that was expiring on 19 th September 2022 yet the contract period had been extended to 2 nd December 2022.\\n\\nFurthermore; the contract manager in his letter to the contractor stated that the contractor should furnish the PDU with an advance payment guarantee that is extended till the intended completion date 2 nd December 2022.\\n\\nThis exposes the PDE to risk of loss of funds in case the contractor fails to meet their obligations.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the contractor had executed over 80% of the works. However, full recovery of the advance payment would be made in line with the contract agreement. There had been a general delay in completion of the works and this had called for contract extensions to enable the work to be completed. The contractor was expected to extend the advance payment guarantee up to May 2023 when the contract would be expected to be completed.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the contractor furnishes Referral Hospital with an advance guarantee that is valid till the completion date of the works.\\n\\n![](assets_Fortportal%20Regional%20Referral%20Hospital%20Report%20of%20Auditor%20General%202022/img-1643.jpg)\\n\\nJohn F.S.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\\n\\n##### Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of the which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the financial statements of Gulu District Local Government for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n##### Basis for Opinion\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of the District in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n##### Key Audit Matters\\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a result, I considered payroll management in LGs a Key Audit Matter and identified crosscutting risks including; unrealistic budgeting for employees and pension costs, under absorption of wage funds, delayed access to the payroll, over payment of salaries, non-payment of salary and pension arrears, among others.\\n\\nI analysed the approved budget and releases to Gulu District for salary, pension and gratuity in the period under review, as shown below;\\n\\n##### Table showing Breakdown of Gulu DLG Budget and releases for the year\\n\\n| **Category** | **Initial budget (UGX) (Bn)** | **Revised budget (UGX) (Bn)** | **Amount released (UGX) (Bn)** | **%age funding received** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| Salary | 17.978 | 18.270 | 17.978 | 97.4 |  \\n| Pension | 3.418 | 3.418 | 3.418 | 100 |  \\n| Pension arrears | 0.462 | 0.462 | 0.462 | 100 |  \\n| Gratuity | 0.798 | 0.798 | 0.798 | 100 |  \\n| **Total** | **22.656** | **22.948** | **22.656** | **98.7** |  \\n\\n\\nThe wage and Pension Pay roll of UGX. 22.948 constituted 53.6% of the District’s budget\\n\\n## for 2020/2021 of UGX.42.3Bn.\\n\\nI am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of payroll management activities. A number of districts did not carry out planned recruitments resulting into huge unspent balances.\\n\\n### Based on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;\\n\\n| **No** | **Observations** | **Recommendations** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 1.1 | **Budgeting for Salary, Pension and Gratuity**  i) **Submission of wage estimates**  Paragraph 2.2 of the Establishment Notice No. 2 of 2019, required LGs to submit salary, pension and gratuity estimates for the subsequent year to Ministry of Public (MoPS) by the 30 th of September of the previous year.  I noted that the District delayed to submit wage estimates to MoPS, as required. The submission was made on 14 th January 2020 which is 106 days after the required date.  This may lead to wage shortfalls/over provision due to lack of clarity and analysis of wage estimates by MoPS.  The Accounting Officer attributed the delayed submission to the health condition of the Head of Human Resource Management Sector, whose absence created a gap in the sector. | I advised the Accounting Officer to always submit wage estimates to MoPS by 30 th September of the preceding year. |  \\n| 1.2 | **Payment of Salaries, Pension and Gratuity**  i) **Absorption of Funds**  I reviewed funds absorption and noted that UGX.17.686 billion (81%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.22.656 billion, resulting in an unabsorbed balance of UGX. 4.97 billion.  The unabsorbed balance was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. | advise  the Accounting  Officer MoPS and MoFPED to reconcile the district payroll with the wage bill always provided and released to the I |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n|| **Refer to the table below;** **Approved**  **Estimates**  **(A)** (UGX ’bns) (UGX ’bns)** **Releases/ Warrant (B)** 18.270 4.678 17.978 **4.678** **Expendi ture(C)** **Unspent (B-C)** **(UGX ’bns)** 14.566 3.120 **(UGX ’bns)** 3.412 1.558 **% absorpti on** 81 66.7 **22.948 22.656 17.686 4.97 78** Wage Pensio/ Gratuity **Total** under absorption of funds, denied the use of funds for other deserving service delivery areas.

The Accounting Officer explained that the under absorption was caused by excess funds released/warranted to the district. The |^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|| ii) **Under payment of pension/ gratuity**  A review of the pension payroll data and IFMS payments, revealed variances between amounts on the payroll and payments to individual pensioners, leading to under payments of UGX.0.300 bn, contrary to article 254 (1) & (3) of the 1995 constitution (as amended). **Details in Appendix 1.**  The underpayment of pension and gratuity negatively affect wellbeing retirees/ or their dependants.  The Accounting Officer attributed this to various reasons ranging from delayed submission of letters of Administration by the beneficiaries to incorrect supplier and bank account numbers. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure  that pension/gratuity  is accurately paid. |  \\n|| iii) **Payment of non-existent pensioners**  UGX.987,066 was paid to one (01) purported pensioner that was neither on the IPPS payroll register nor possessed the necessary documentation to support the existence, contrary to Section (L - b) (2) of Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2010. Sn Supplier No **1.**  869976 Name Of Staff David Oyet Tidy Amount  987,066 Pension availed Remarks  file not led to loss of funds to Government and over statement of pension expenditure.  The Accounting Officer explained that Mr. David Oyet Tidy is not a pensioner of Gulu District; and that management was still trying to trace how the officer was paid as a pensioner on Gulu district site. This |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to recover funds from the purported pensioner. |  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|| iv) **Wrong computation of Gratuity**  Paragraph (L-d) (3) provides that a public officer has an option to receive all his or her pension as an annuity or to commute a third (1/3) of his or her pension for a 15-year period and receive it as a lump sum at retirement. re-computation of gratuity benefits, I noted that the District had wrongly computed gratuity benefits for 01 pensioner although payment of UGX.8,351,004 was fully effected within the year under review. Through |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to recover  the overpayment from the pensioner. |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| However, the Human resource officer confirmed that the correct annual salary of the one (01) pensioner as per the salary structure is UGX. 2,844,832 and the length of service 285 months. If calculated correctly then the CPG amount should have been UGX. 7,101,771 instead of UGX. 8,351,004 leading to an overpayment of UGX. 1,249,233.  This was attributed to error in the computation of the gratuity. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| v) **Delayed deletion of staff from payroll**  Section B-a (12) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010 requires the payment of salary to public officers to be stopped immediately they cease rendering services to Government under whatever circumstances, including death.  I noted that UGX. 39,616,954 was paid to 11 staff who had either retired, transferred, absconded or died as detailed in **appendix 2.**  These were payment for services not rendered to the District resulting in loss of funds to Government.  The Accounting Officer attributed  to; non- validation status, inconsistencies in dates of birth, on IPPS and National IDs and the conditions set by the MoPS for correction of date of birth is so difficult to fulfil for pensioners who were recruited in service long time. this |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure  prompt removal of staff from the payroll. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| **Management of Payroll Deductions**  i) **Over/Under remittance of deductions**  Section B-a (17) requires a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations to be deducted from his or her salary, in accordance with the regulations. noted that whereas UGX.3,908,218,081 was deducted from employees’ salaries to be remitted to different beneficiaries, UGX.3,916,669,698 was remitted, leading to an over/under remittance of UGX.13,319,747 and UGX.4,868,130 respectively as shown in the table below.

In addition, only deductions consented to by employees, in writing, should be submitted to the MoPS for timely monthly payroll processing or as advised by the employer.  \\uf0b7 I noted that the District made unauthorised loan deductions totalling UGX. 15,490,451. The deductions were from 42 employees that neither had letters of undertaking nor existed in the “active deduction” or the “my approval” reports on the PDMS-Payroll Deduction Management System, operated by PCA-Payroll Consults Africa as shown in **Appendix** **3.**  There is a risk of making deductions from staff that have no loans, which defrauds them of their hard earned funds.  The Accounting Officer did not provide response on the issue. | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all loan applications are always backed by letters of undertaking and are approved through the PDMS. |  \\n|| iii) **Delayed remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA**  Paragraph 4.6.1 of Establishment Notice No. 2 of 2019 requires payroll deductions to be remitted concurrently with salary payments. \\uf0b7 I noted that the District made payroll deductions but did not remit concurrently with the salary payments in 11 out of 12 months. On average, it delayed by 25.3 days, as shown in **appendix 4.**  Delayed remittance of deductions to UCLA/UBA could lead to delays in up- dating loan status with the various financial institutions causing un-necessary default charges on employees.  The Accounting Officer acknowledged the issue and pledged to ensure timely/concurrent remittances. | that I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure  all deductions  to UCLA/UBA  are remitted concurrently with salary payments. |  \\n|| iv)  **Delayed remittance of PAYE deductions to URA**  Section 123(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1997 (as amended) requires withholding agents to URA any tax that has been withheld or that should have been withheld within fifteen days after the end of the month in which the payment subject to withholding tax was made by the withholding agent. \\uf0b7 I noted delays in the remittance of PAYE deductions to URA ranging from 1 – 31 days, as shown in **appendix 5.** Delayed remittance of PAYE attracts fines and penalties from the Revenue Authority.  The Accounting Officer acknowledged the issue and pledged to ensure timely/concurrent remittances. | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure  all deductions to URA are remitted concurrently with salary payments. that |  \\n|| v) **Non deduction of PAYE from political leaders**  I noted that the District did not subject political leaders’ gratuity totalling to UGX.36,733,861 to the computation of PAYE in IPPS, leading to an under deduction of UGX.11,003,344, contrary to section 19(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act. Details are shown in the **appendix 6.** | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that political leaders’ gratuity is subjected to tax by including in the gross taxable income when |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n|| This denies Government the would be revenue.  The Accounting Officer explained that the computation of PAYE on persons on payroll had solely been the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Service. The district receives a finalized payroll register report and the interface file for payment detailing all deductions to be paid; however, management pledged to consult further with the MoPS to avoid re-occurrence of the omission. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| computing PAYE. |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1.4 | Month payroll was accessed Estimated variance in days Estimated variance in weeks **Access to Payrolls**  i) **Delayed access to Salary Payroll**  Section B-a (11) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010, requires Accounting Officers to ensure that Public Officers access the payroll within four (4) weeks from date of assumption of duty.  I noted that two (02) newly transferred employees delayed to access payroll, with delays ranging between 4-8 weeks, as shown in the table below;  Audit  remarks Employee Name Assumptio n date Employe e ID S n 1\\\\. 942244 2\\\\. 187574 Total Average Charles Ocan Ray Sam Ojok Omara 14/04/202 1 14/4/2021 6/30/2021 6/30/2021 31 61 92 46 4 8 12 6 Delayed Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears.  The Accounting Officer explained that the two officers transferred their services to the district, but failed to notify the district of their transfer in time.

In case of death or early retirement, the process should be initiated immediately the Letters of Administration are issued and/or the early retirement has been granted.  I noted that 05 pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays ranging between 01-6 months, as shown in the table below;  **Estimated**  **variance** in days** **Month payroll was accessed** **Retirement date/death date** **Employee Name** **Audit remarks** **Employe e ID** **Sn** 312337 Albert Ocaya 25/10/2020 31/03/2021 16/10/2020  31/03/2021 121 121 Delayed Delayed 1. 2. 3. 4. 272440 273075 273552 Kilama,  Joseph  Awor, Mary Langol  Okech, Richard  Lakot, Joyce Rev 9/1/2021 31/03/2021 31 Delayed 09/10/2020 31/05/2021 182 Delayed 5\\\\. 661820 10/03/2020 31/10/2020 184 Delayed **Total Average** **639 42.6** access to the pension payroll leads to poor wellbeing of the affected retirees as well as accumulation of pension arrears.

Accounting Officer attributed this to the Human Resource Management sector was unable to undertake monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis returns on the payroll to MoPS because of the health condition of the head of the sector, whose absence created staffing gap in the sector. This The | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analyses  are undertaken and that quarterly returns on payroll are submitted to MoPS. |  \\n|| ii) **Payments of salaries, pension & gratuity off IPPS**  Paragraph 4.5 of Establishment Notice No. 2 of 2019 requires the responsible officer to pay for only salaries, pension and gratuity processed through IPPS. From a comparison of the payroll register and IFMS payment file. noted that 16 staff and 05 pensioners were paid a total of UGX. 114 million off the IPPS, as shown in **Appendix 7.** control weakness creates an opportunity for payment of salaries and pension to non-eligible persons, hence loss of funds to Government.  The Accounting Officer explained that:-  1\\\\. Mr. Opwonya Eric Mark Kafunzi is an employee who was being paid salary from Uganda Road Fund off the payroll.  2\\\\. The interim chairpersons of the newly created Sub Counties had not been loaded on the IPPS; hence being paid off the IPPS. I This | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that salaries, pension and gratuity is processed and paid through the IPPS. |  \\n| 1.6 | **System related challenges**  i) **Inconsistencies between MoPS and entity payroll registers**  I observed that there were variances of UGX.35,994,412 between the figures in the MoPS IPPS and entity payroll register, as shown in **appendix 8.**  The above undermines the integrity of the IPPS system and there is risk of manipulation and misappropriation of salary/pension funds due to lack of reconciliatory controls between the entity information and IPPS master data at MoPS.  The Accounting Officer attributed the inconsistencies to cases where some salary arrears as effected/ invoiced directly through the IFMS outside the IPPS due to validation challenges; hence, inconsistencies in the information on IPPS and NIS. | I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the entity IPPS payroll registers are consistent with MoPS payroll data. |  \\n|| ii) **Effectiveness and reliability of the IPPS/NID interface**  I  the staff/pensioner/beneficiaries’ verification interface and noted the following; reviewed the effectiveness and reliability of IPPS/NID \\uf0b7 There was adequate sensitization and training in the use and navigation of the system. | I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoPS to ensure  effective verification of the IPPS |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n- System was not reliable and effective as it does not generate and NID interface is information such as photographs and dates of birth from NID.  \\ncarried.\\n- Operational challenges were encountered such; as unreliable network and failure in generating information from the NID system.\\n\\nThe ineffectiveness of the system may affect the integrity of the IPPS payroll. The Accounting Officer explained that this mandate lies with the MoPS.\\n\\n##### Emphasis of Matter\\n\\nWithout modifying my opinion, I would like to draw the readers’ attention to the following matters which have been disclosed in the financial statements of the District;\\n\\n##### 2.0 Outstanding Payables (Deposits received)\\n\\nA review of the statement of financial position on page 19 of the financial statements revealed that the district had outstanding payables of UGX.1.211 bn (Deposits received UGX.1.100 bn and Trade creditors of UGX.0.111bn) by the end of the year. A detailed review of the categorization and aging of the payables in note 24 on page 36 of the financial statements revealed that out of the outstanding payables, UGX.0.95 bn relate to the previous financial years.\\n\\nThese long outstanding payables may lead to litigation costs due to non or delayed settlement.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to prioritize full settlement of the long outstanding payables.\\n\\n##### 3.0 Long Outstanding Receivables\\n\\nIncluded in the statement of financial position on page 11 of the Financial Statements is a long outstanding debtors amount of UGX.2.063 bn (Accrued revenue UGX.0.985 bn and Advances (YLP & UWEP) UGX.1.078 bn). However, there was no evidence that management made any effort to enforce recoveries. There is a risk that these funds may become uncollectible leading to a financial loss to the entity.\\n\\nReceivables represent an idle asset that denies the Council the opportunity to utilise the funds to implement planned activities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### 4.0 Implementation of the approved budget\\n\\nA review of the district’s approved work plans and budgets revealed that the Gulu District had an approved budget (revised) of UGX.42.3Bn, out of which UGX.30.9Bn was warranted/ availed by the end of the financial year. The total expenditure for the year was UGX.26.5Bn out of which UGX.18.9Bn 1 was spent on non-service delivery activities, such as employee costs and transfers to other units (i.e. Town-councils, sub-counties, schools), implying that only UGX.7.6Bn was available for direct implementation of service delivery outputs.\\n\\nBase on procedures undertaken, I made the following significant observations.\\n\\n| **No** | **Observation** | **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 4.1 | **Existence of Strategic plans that are aligned to NDP-III**  Paragraph 5 of the budget execution circular for financial year 2020/2021 states that over the years the alignment of Government Budgets with the NDP has been poor and needs to be improved. Therefore, Accounting Officers must ensure that all activities for the Financial Year 2020/2021 are aligned with NDP III and implemented accordingly.  This being the first year of implementation of the NDP-III, the entity was expected to prepare and approve a strategic plan that was aligned to NDP III. It is from this strategic plan that the annual plans would be based in order to achieve the objectives of NDP-III. noted that the entity had prepared and submitted the strategic plan to NPA and has been sent back for necessary corrections and awaiting approval at the time of audit. is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives. The Accounting Officer explained that the District had a draft strategic plan i.e. District Development plan III which was submitted to NPA for review. NPA has since returned the draft and management is incorporating the comments of NPA and a final Draft will be approved by council by the time of laying on table of the Budget for FY 2022/23.

These reports should clearly indicate the actual performance against the planned outputs and performance for each quarter, showing the quantity/quality and physical location of the reported outputs against expenditure. 4.5 of the two (2) outputs with a total of five (5) activities and expenditure of UGX.0.93Bn sampled for assessment I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities and noted the following; \\uf0b7 One (1) output with a total of three (3) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.304Bn were fully quantified. That is, all the three (3) activities (100%) within these outputs were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance. \\uf0b7 One (1) output with a total of two (2) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.629Bn were insufficiently quantified.

A review of the Contracts Committee minutes for the meeting held on 7 th June 2021 under minute GDLG 10/CC03/2020-2021, a decision was reached to grant an extension up to 31 st August 2021.\\n\\nDespite this extension, the works were not completed by the time of field inspection on 2 nd September 2021. A review of the progress report revealed that planned works were behind schedule by 15 months. It was also noted at the time of site inspection that the contractor had abandoned the site and the workers had been idle for five months.

In this instance however most of the CMGs reports were channelled to Inspectorate of Government who was overseeing the STAAC component as indicated in section 7.3.3 (c).\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to raise the issue with relevant Ministries so that the anomaly is addressed in the subsequent NUSAF funding.\\n\\n**8.0**\\n\\n##### Payment of advances to personal Accounts\\n\\nAccording to the letter from PSST of Ref. HRM/222/01 dated 9 th August 2012 and one from the Accountant General dated 17 th December 2018 to all Accounting Officers prescribed that all payments for works, supplies and general services should be paid direct to the beneficiaries/suppliers through the IFMS and all payments to beneficiaries whose master data is not on the entity’s IFMS site, for activities such as workshop facilitation and any other one off payment can be made through the E-Cash platform to the beneficiary’s mobile account.\\n\\nIt was however noted that advances to a tune of UGX.34,450,000 were paid to various staff personal bank accounts to carry out official activities contrary to the above provisions as shown in **Appendix 11.**  \\nThere is a risk of not paying the beneficiaries the right amounts at the right time and loss of money through theft or deductions by banks for those accounts servicing loans.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer pledged to follow up with MoFPED to ensure the E-cash mode of payment is implemented.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always carry out sensitization of target beneficiaries on importance of E-Cash platform and encourage them open mobile money/bank accounts so as to foster efficiency and convenience in execution of cash payments.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n##### Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the District.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the District’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the District’s financial reporting process.\\n\\n##### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also;\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts’ internal control.\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the District’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the District to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n##### Other Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n![](assets_Gulu%20DLG%20Report%20of%20Auditor%20General%202021/img-6751.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n---\\n\\n##### Appendix 1: Non/ Underpayment of pension and gratuity\\n\\n| SN. | Name | Supplier

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT**\\n\\n### Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of Gulu District Local Government,\\n\\n## which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Statement of\\n\\nFinancial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\n#### In my opinion, the financial statements of Gulu District Local Government for the year ended 30 th June 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with section 51 of the\\n\\nPublic Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n### Basis for Opinion\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the\\n\\n#### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the District Local Government in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International\\n\\nEthics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA\\n\\n## Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial\\n\\nStatements in Uganda.\\n\\n#### I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate\\n\\nto provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n### Key Audit Matters\\n\\n#### Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period.

Despite these reforms, challenges have persisted in the payroll management in the Local Governments.\\n\\n## During my audit of the previous financial year (2020/21), I undertook a comprehensive\\n\\naudit of payroll management in the Districts, Cities, and Municipal Councils, which\\n\\n---\\n\\n## revealed major challenges.

Consumer Lenders’ Association/ Uganda Bankers Association (UCLA/UBA) contracted Payroll Consults Africa (PCA) to manage employee deductions on their behalf using the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS). reviewed employee payroll deductions (non-statutory) and the PDMS records (active deductions report and my approvals) and observed the following; **a) Letters of undertaking or Consent**  Section 4.2 (b) of the guidelines of managing salary deductions on the Government payroll, 2014 states that as part of the due diligence process, the credit lending institutions and banks will seek for a letter of undertaking from the Accounting Officer/employer or a designated officer confirming that the officer is a bona fide Government employee indicating his or her positions in the MDA/LG, payment details, terms of appointment and other details that may be prescribed by the lending institution. observed that all loan/savings deductions to employees were supported with letters of undertaking or consent letters as a prerequisite of approval of the deductions. **) Deduction past the deduction end date**  I observed that UGX.10,251,751 relating to 06 employees was deducted past the end date.

In addition, only deductions consented to by employees, in writing, should be submitted to the Ministry of Public Service for timely monthly payroll processing or as advised by Ministry of Public Service. **) Unapproved loan deductions by Accounting Officer in** deductions from staff resulting into financial loss. payroll deductions under code 482 are required to be approved by the Accounting Officer in the PDMS under “my approvals” report.  I observed that UCLA/UBA deducted UGX.1,468,850 from 8 staff without approval of the Accounting Officer from the PDMS. This creates an opportunity for misappropriation of funds through making fictitious deductions as well as over deductions. addition, an over deduction of UGX.3,483,930 and under deduction of UGX.9,736,407 was made by UCLA/UBA from 113 staff against the approved amounts by the Accounting Officer. This resulted into financial loss to the affected staff. **Reliability of the Payroll Deduction Management System** “Active” deductions report and “my approvals” report in the PDMS should have consistent deduction amounts to give confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the system. comparison of the “active deductions” and “my approvals” reports in the PDMS revealed that there were variances in deduction amounts. also noted that there were variances in monthly deduction amounts in active deductions report in the PDMS and IPPS payroll. of integrity of the system creates an opportunity for manipulation of the deduction which could result into financial loss to the affected employees.

For instance, only 46 (98%) of the\\n\\nplanned 47 SACCOs were funded by the District with each receiving UGX.7,051,875, leaving out 01 (2%) SACCOs because they submitted wrong accounts information to\\n\\n## the District out of the initially planned UGX.17,000,000.\\n\\n#### The Accounting Officer acknowledged the shortcoming and explained that payment to Kal Ali B SACCO group bounced and management had written to MoFPED for the\\n\\nfunds to be re-voted back in the financial year 2022/2023.\\n\\n#### I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with MoFPED to ensure that all budgeted funds are realized for appropriate implementation of the PDM activities. Additionally,\\n\\nunimplemented activities should be rolled over to the next financial year.\\n\\n### 7.1.2 Repurposing and utilization of PDM funds\\n\\n#### The district repurposed funds meant for gadgets & tools and staff costs to the revolving funds and Administrative Costs as shown in the table below:\\n\\n| **Description** | **Prodn Mkting dept** **&** | **Administrati ve costs** | **Gadgets and tools** | **Staff costs** | **Revolving fund** | **Remarks** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| Release | 56,000,000 | 47,026,620 | 53,237,683 | 128,923,919 | 280,740,040 ||  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| Funds repurposed | (56,000,000 ) | 56,000,000 | (53,237,683) | 0 | 53,237,683 | \\\\- All funds for gadgets  and tools  were repurposed to revolving funds.  -  Repurposed funds from Prodn /Mrkting |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| Additional PDM funds | 0 | 4,635,568 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Additional funding Administrative costs for |  \\n| **Funds available to spend** || **107,662,188** | **0** | **128,923,919** | **333,977,723** ||  \\n\\n\\n#### I undertook a review of the utilization of funds for Revolving fund worth UGX.333,977,723, administrative costs of UGX.107,662,188 and staff cost of\\n\\nUGX.128,923,919; and observed the following:\\n\\n### 7.1.3 Revolving fund\\n\\nThe district was supposed to disburse UGX.324,386,250 to 47 registered SACCOS. I undertook analysis of the disbursement and noted the following:\\n\\n### a) Funds diverted\\n\\n#### I noted that a total of UGX.53,237,683 for gadgets and tools was diverted to revolving fund for subsequent disbursement to registered SACCOs contrary to Regulation 16(1) of the PFMR, 2016 that requires an Accounting Officer to request the Minister for approval to vary, within a vote, the amount of money allocated to\\n\\nthe vote.\\n\\nInitially planned procurement of gadgets and tools could not be implemented. As\\n\\n## a result, monitoring and supervision of SACCO activities was hindered.\\n\\n#### The Accounting Officer explained that UGX.53,237,683 diverted from gadgets and tools was based on a PS/ST circular dated 20 th May 2022 ref.BPD86/150/01 where\\n\\nit was guided that part of the funds under staff costs, gadgets & tools be repurposed for the Parish Revolving funds with the same votes. Therefore, those\\n\\n#### funds were accordingly disbursed to the 47 PDM SACCOs as directed and the funds are still held in the respective SACCO accounts.\\n\\n### 7.1.4 Administrative Costs\\n\\n## The administrative costs were meant for coordinating operations and implementing\\n\\nadministrative structures at the district/municipality, sub county and parish level for the effective implementation of the PDM. A detailed breakdown of the administrative costs is shown in the table below:\\n\\n| **S/N** | **Description** | **Amounts(UGX)** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| **1** | Mobilization and community sensitization & Monitoring and Supervision by DEC/ senior management | 47,026,620 |  \\n|| **TOTAL** | **47,026,620** |  \\n\\n\\n## I however, noted that an additional UGX.56,000,000 from production and marketing\\n\\nDepartment was diverted to the Administrative cost without the approval of the\\n\\n## Minister of Finance and Parliament.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### I however noted that the district expenditure of UGX.107,662,188 on administrative costs was adequately supported with required documents of accountability. For\\n\\nexample, payment sheets, receipts, reports and attendance sheets were attached where necessary.\\n\\n### 7.1.5 Staff Costs\\n\\n#### These funds were meant for the recruitment and payment of salaries for the Parish Chiefs whose main role is to mobilize, sensitize and create awareness on PDM\\n\\nprograms to the community, as well as coordinate and support implementation of\\n\\n## PDM activities among others. The following were observed;\\n\\n## I noted that out of UGX.128,923,919 released, UGX.128,102,007 was spent and\\n\\nproperly accounted for the balance of UGX.821,912 was bounced salary for one parish chief for the months of May 2022 and June 2022 which was swept back to the consolidated fund.\\n\\n## The affected parish chief was demoralized by this action.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer indicated management had written to MoFPED for funds to be re-voted back in the financial year 2022/23.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to make a follow up of unspent funds to have the missed salary paid.\\n\\n### 7.1.6 Contradictory PDM implementation guidelines/directives\\n\\n## From my review of the implementation of PDM activities, I noted that the entity\\n\\nreceived numerous guidance’s from different authorities and at times they appeared\\n\\n## contradictory therefore causing challenges during implementation. Some of these\\n\\nguidance’s include:\\n\\n| **Subject/Area** | **Issuing Authority** | **Guideline** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| Transfer of funds to PDM SACCOs | PDM Secretariat | Funds should go direct to PDM SACCO accounts in commercial banks |  \\n|^| PSST | Funds to be sent to entity General Fund Accounts |  \\n| Diversion/  re- allocation of funds | PSST | letter Referenced BPD86/150/01 and dated 20 th May 2022 stated that funds budgeted for under gadgets and tools should be repurposed to the Parish Revolving Fund |  \\n|^| Public Finance Management Regulation | Regulation 16(1) of the PFMR. 2016 states that an Accounting Officer may request the Minister for approval to vary, within a vote, the amount of money allocated to the vote. |  \\n\\n\\n## Contradictory guidance negatively affected progress of implementation of PDM\\n\\nactivities.\\n\\n## I informed the Accounting Officer that the matter will be brought to the attention of\\n\\nthe relevant authorities. I advised the PDM secretariat to review the various\\n\\n---\\n\\nguidance’s issued with view of harmonizing guidance given to implementers of PDM activities.\\n\\n### 7.2 Ex-Gratia payments\\n\\n## According to the Local Government Act (as amended), District/City councillors are\\n\\nentitled to monthly allowance (ex-gratia) of UGX.250,000.\\n\\n#### The PS/ST, in the 2nd budget call circular for the financial year 2021/22 noted that, a number of LGs continue to report shortfalls in councillors’ allowances and ex-gratia for Political Leaders in their budgets. Therefore, PS/ST directed all Accounting Officers to adequately budget for ex-gratia and Councillor’s allowance and pay\\n\\naccordingly.\\n\\nI developed procedures to establish whether the ex-gratia in the DLD was adequately budgeted for, paid timely and in accordance with the rates prescribed by\\n\\n## the Local Government Act. Below are my observations:\\n\\nI noted that the District adequately budgeted for UGX.150,360,000 and paid ex- gratia and allowances for 22 District councillors under the LG Council Administration Services output (138201).\\n\\n### Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries\\n\\n#### by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The Other Information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Other Information and I\\n\\ndo not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\n#### In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the Other Information and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially\\n\\nconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.\\n\\n## I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n### M anagement’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\\n\\n#### Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the PFMA, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of Gulu District Local Government.\\n\\n#### The Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable\\n\\nthe preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\n## In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the\\n\\nDLGs ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters affecting\\n\\n## ability to deliver its mandate for the foreseeable future, unless the Accounting Officer has a\\n\\nrealistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of Financial Statements\\n\\n## My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as\\n\\na whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an\\n\\n## auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,\\n\\nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect\\n\\n## a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\\n\\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\n#### As part of an audit in accordance with ISSAI’s, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\\n\\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for\\n\\n## my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is\\n\\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design\\n\\naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\\n\\n#### expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the DLGs internal control. \\uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\\n\\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\n## \\uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of\\n\\naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\\n\\n## exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the DLGs ability\\n\\nto deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial\\n\\n## statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions\\n\\nare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.\\n\\n#### However, future events or conditions may cause the DLG to fail to deliver its mandate. \\uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,\\n\\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant\\n\\n## deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\n## I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant\\n\\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\n## From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that\\n\\nwere of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and\\n\\n## are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless\\n\\nlaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare\\n\\n## circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because\\n\\nthe adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Other Reporting Responsibilities\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on\\n\\n## my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised\\n\\nin compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n### Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\n## The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters\\n\\nare as follows;\\n\\n**8.0**\\n\\n### Existence of Strategic plans that are aligned to NDP-III\\n\\n## Regulation 26 (1) of the National Planning Authority (development of Plans)\\n\\nregulations requires entities to submit to NPA their five-year development plans for\\n\\n#### certification before approval.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2021, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the financial statements of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) for the financial year ended 30 th June 2021 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n**Basis for Opinion**\\n\\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of Ministry of Works and Transport in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda.\\n\\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n**Key Audit Matters**\\n\\nKey Audit atters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.\\n\\n**1.0**\\n\\n# Implementation of the Approved Budget\\n\\nOn the 24 th of April 2020, Parliament approved the annual budget for MDAs and LGs that contained the specific resource envelope allocated to each vote to implement agreed on outputs. Subsequently, the PS/ST issued a Budget Execution Circular that communicated the budget strategy, policy, and administrative issues to guide the budget implementation for the financial year 2020/2021.\\n\\n---\\n\\nDuring my overall risk assessment exercise, I noted that MDAs and LGs are still experiencing challenges in implementing the budgets approved by parliament and policy guidance’s issued by PS/ST, which has continued to affect the performance and credibility of the budget negatively. These challenges include; lack of strategic plans that are aligned to the National Development Plans, underperformance of revenue, implementation of off-budget activities, under absorption of funds, insufficient quantification of outputs, partial and non-implementation of outputs, diversion of funds and challenges in budget monitoring and reporting of performance.\\n\\nI am aware that the Covid-19 Pandemic continues to significantly affect the implementation of several activities. Consequently, a number of activities were not implemented due to budget cuts and lockdown measures instituted to control the spread of the pandemic. It is against this background that the implementation of the budget was again considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning for the current audit year.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) was established in May 2006 when Government re-organized Ministries, and is mandated to:\\n\\n- Plan, develop and maintain an economic efficient and effective transport infrastructure;\\n- Plan, develop and maintain economic, efficient and effective transport services by road, rail, water and air;\\n- Manage public works including government structures, and;\\n- Promote good standards in the construction industry.\\n\\nTo achieve this mandate, MoWT planned to implement both recurrent and capital development activities. A review of the entity’s ministerial policy statement and budget revealed that the entity had a revised approved budget of UGX 1,818.717 bn, out of which UGX 1,280.322 bn was warranted. Table 1 below shows a summary of the key outputs of the MoWT for the financial year 2020/21.\\n\\n| **No** | **Details** | **Budget (UGX) “000”** | **Cumulative percentage share of the total approved budget** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 1 | 040107 Safety of Navigation Programs Coordinated and Monitored | 25,633,264 | 1.4 |  \\n| 2 | 040176 Purchase of Office and ICT Equipment Including Software | 19,450,000 | 2.5 |  \\n| 3 | 040252 Rehabilitation of Upcountry Aerodromes by UCAA and Wages for UNACL Staff | 175,383,950 | 12.1 |  \\n| 4 | 040254 Development of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) Infrastructure | 19,000,000 | 13.2 |  \\n| 5 | 040273 Roads, Streets and Highways | 200,450,000 | 24.2 |  \\n| 6 | 040275 Purchase of Motor Vehicles and Other Transport Equipment | 539,719,100 | 53.9 |  \\n| 7 | 040280 Construction / Rehabilitation of Inland Water Transport Infrastructure | 92,036,439 | 58.9 |  \\n| 8 | 040281 Construction / Rehabilitation of Railway Infrastructure | 89,811,712 | 63.9 |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 9 | 040283 Border Post Rehabilitation / Construction | 298,883,115 | 80.3 |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| 10 | 040304 Monitoring and Capacity Building Support | 10,598,160 | 80.9 |  \\n| 11 | 040402 Monitoring and Capacity Building | 13,288,450 | 81.6 |  \\n| 12 | 040473 Roads, Streets and Highways | 116,432,487 | 88 |  \\n| 13 | 040474 Major Bridges | 23,461,350 | 89.3 |  \\n| 14 | 040481 Urban Roads Construction and Rehabilitation (Bitumen Standard) | 11,967,419 | 90 |  \\n| 15 | 040505 Operation and Maintenance of MV Kalangala Ship | 35,488,000 | 91.9 |  \\n| 16 | 040551 Transfers to Regional Mechanical Workshops | 16,588,600 | 92.8 |  \\n| 17 | 044919 Human Resource Management Services | 24,080,823 | 94.1 |  \\n|| **Total** | **1,712,272,869** | **94.1** |  \\n\\n\\nMoWT planned to accomplish its budgetary objectives by implementing sixty three (63) outputs with a total approved budget of UGX.1,818.717bn. I sampled three (3) Programmes; 0404 District, Urban and Community Access Roads; 0403 Construction Standards and Quality Assurance and Programme: 0402 Transport Services and Infrastructure with thirty seven (37) outputs with a total of one hundred sixty eight (168) activities and a budget of UGX 1,315.281bn representing 72.3% of the total approved budget for review.\\n\\nFrom the procedures undertaken, I noted the following:\\n\\n| **No** | **Observation** | **Recommendations** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| 4.1.1 | **Existence of a Strategic plan that is aligned to NDP-III** Paragraph 5 of the budget execution circular for the financial year 2020/2021 cites poor alignment of Government Budgets with the National Development Plans. The PS/ST urges Accounting Officers to ensure that all activities for Financial Year 2020/2021 are aligned with NDP III and implemented accordingly. Regulation 26 (1) of the National Planning Authority (development of Plans) regulations require entities to submit to NPA their five-year development plans for certification before approval. being the first year of implementation of the NDP-III, the entity was expected to prepare a strategic plan aligned to NDP III and ensure that the plan is approved. The strategic plan would then form the basis of the preparation of the entity’s annual plans. document review and interviews, I noted that the entity had prepared a strategic plan.

In addition, the Accounting Officer explained that adjustments are delayed by two months after end of the financial year (August-September) yet the 4 th quarter cumulative annual report is produced not later than 30 th July of every financial year.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Emphasis of Matter**\\n\\nWithout modifying my opinion, I would like to draw the readers’ attention to the following matter(s) which have been disclosed in the financial statements of the Ministry:\\n\\n# 2.0 Long outstanding advances\\n\\nReview of Receivables in the Statement of Financial Position and Note 19 revealed that the Ministry had receivables worth UGX.1,570,776,843 out of which those worth UGX.623,855,947 were outstanding at the end of the previous year.\\n\\nThe likelihood of eventual clearance of the receivables that have been outstanding for over a year therefore seemed remote.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the figure included the loss which was incurred in 2008, where the MoFPED staff that were attached as IT support, created a fictitious company on IFMS.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up on the clearance of the advances as soon as possible.\\n\\n# Other Matter\\n\\nIn addition to the matters raised above, I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements:\\n\\n**3.0**\\n\\n# Failure to maintain district road equipment\\n\\nThe inspection of the Ministry’s Regional Mechanical Workshops during August and September 2021 revealed that twenty one (21) units of district road equipment had been lying in the workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair. The equipment included: thirteen (13) motor graders of different models; four (4) bulldozers; One (1) pickup; two (2) dump trucks, and one (1) wheel loader.\\n\\nIn addition, requests for 136 tyres for running district road equipment were not honoured during the year.\\n\\nThis means that the districts that own the concerned equipment could not maintain their roads and deliver such critical service to the country as planned. In addition, the cost of repair is escalating because other parts also become faulty when the equipment is grounded for a long time.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the amount budgeted and received to maintain road equipment represents 30% of the total funds (UGX44.6bn) required for equipment maintenance. Hence, during the FY 2020/21, the Ministry prioritized mainly the servicing of the newly acquired equipment from Japan leaving out the older equipment (from China) that requires major repairs but have no budget. Maintenance of district equipment is one of the critically underfunded activities in the Ministry.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer also said that it is true that a number of road equipment in the districts lack tyres. This is mainly due to an inadequate maintenance budget for the equipment.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the responsible authorities to obtain the necessary funding for the full maintenance of the equipment so that the equipment operates and serves the Districts.\\n\\n**4.0**\\n\\n# Grounded aircrafts used for training\\n\\nAudit inspection and review of the East African Civil Aviation Academy (EACAA) in Soroti; and review of the Academy’s assets register and aircraft annual serviceability status report of 06/09/2021 revealed that 3 out of the 9 aircrafts were grounded due to non- repair and maintenance. The aircrafts were (registration numbers): 5X-RWE grounded due to a defective fuel injector pump; 5X-UAN grounded for mandatory structural modification and 5X -YKM grounded for a propeller overhaul.\\n\\nIt was further noted that their certificates of airworthiness (C and A) for had expired. This made it difficult for the Academy to offer practical training.\\n\\nManagement explained that this was due to reasons beyond their control such as delay by the foreign contractor to commence repairs of 5X-UAN 310 due to the closure of the boarders immediately after the signing of the contract. Management further stressed that the academy had challenges in the procurement of spares for the aircraft due to global delays due to the effects of COVID-19.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the contractor to ensure that the aircrafts are repaired as soon as the situation normalizes.\\n\\n# Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer of MoWT is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact.\\n\\nI have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n# Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Ministry.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.  \\n14\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Ministry’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Ministry’s financial reporting process.\\n\\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:-\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Ministry’s internal control.\\n\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Ministry’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Ministry to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n**Other Reporting Responsibilities**\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n# Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 13 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of the Authority with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.\\n\\nThe material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;\\n\\n**5.0**\\n\\n# Delayed compensation of PAPs for the development of the New Kampala Port in Bukasa\\n\\nParagraph 11 of the land acquisition procedure of Appendix 1 in the Guidelines for Compensation Assessment under Land Acquisition (GCALA) of June 2017 states that the period from final report approval to payment of compensation awards shall not exceed 6 months.\\n\\nThe valuation report for 2,378 PAPs with a total compensation sum of UGX 29.2 billion was approved by the Chief Government Valuer in October 2018. The review of documents indicated that a total of 1,253 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.19.5 billion had been paid by 30 th June 2021. As a result a total of 1,125 PAPs with a total compensation value of UGX.9.7 billion have remained unpaid for about three years.\\n\\nDelayed compensation of PAPs delays implementation of the project leading to escalation of the project cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry budgeted for the remaining funds UGX 9.7Bn in the FY 2021/22 that was approved by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. The Ministry has compensated 1,704 PAPs out of 2,378 PAPS as at 30 th October 2021. The remaining 674 PAPS will be compensated this FY 2021/22.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the budgeted funds are realised so that compensation is completed and works start in the FY 2021/2022.\\n\\n**6.0**\\n\\n# Implementation of unplanned procurements\\n\\nSection 15(1) of the PFMA, 2015 provides that “after approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the Secretary to Treasury shall issue the annual cash-flow plan of Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans and recruitment plans approved by Parliament”.\\n\\nIn addition, section 21(1) provides that “an Accounting Officer shall, based on the annual cash-flow plan issued by the Secretary to the Treasury under section 15, plan and manage the activities as indicated in the policy statement of the vote”.\\n\\nA review of procurement records revealed that procurements worth UGX 1,772,908,757 which were not planned were implemented by the Ministry.\\n\\nImplementation of unplanned procurements is not only contrary to the PPDA Act, but it negatively affects the implementation of planned procurements and defeats the purpose for procurement planning.\\n\\nAlthough the Accounting Officer explained that the the procurements were planned, I was not availed evidence to support the assertion.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always implement the budget basing on the procurement plans and work plan as approved by Parliament.\\n\\n**7.0**\\n\\n# Delayed completion of road construction project\\n\\nThe review of procurement reference number MoWT/WRKS/2018/19/00191 indicated that the Ministry entered into a contract with M/s Probase Manufacturing SDN BHD and Abubaker Technical Services and General Supplies Limited JV on 16 th May, 2019 for piloting the use of probase technology for construction of roads in Uganda. The contract was for designing and building Kayunga - Nabuganyi and Nansana – Kireka - Bbira roads at a total cost of UGX.45,349,361,632. The contract provided that the works were to be completed by 01/07/2020.\\n\\nHowever, the examination of records indicated that contract spilled over into the year under review and t payments amounting to UGX.10,907,877,818 were made during the year.\\n\\nThe intended objective of piloting the technology in Uganda was not achieved.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the contract implementation spilled over to the year under review due to the following reasons;\\n\\n---\\n\\n1. The contractor encountered unforeseen adverse physical conditions along the swamp section on the Kayunga – Nabuganyi road (20.2km) such as soft ground high water table measuring up to a length of 4.65km which necessitated special treatment such as the use of rockfill, geosynthetics, and embankment construction to avert possible premature defects and failure of the road. The extra works required extra time for both construction and also allow for consolidation of the new fill sections to warrant stability.\\n\\n2. The employer required additional works.\\n\\n3. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world led to difficulty in site operations, worker movements and general mobility of supplies. For instance, the factories manufacturing inputs for the technology (Probase TX-85 soil stabilizers and Probase PB-65 sealants) in Malaysia were closed to curb the spread of the virus for some time and on reopening the factories, shipping schedules became a challenge.\\n\\nA lot of time lost is attributed to that.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to closely supervise the contract to ensure that the project is completed by the extended timeline.\\n\\n**8.0**\\n\\n# Planned procurements not implemented – UGX 7,465,000,000\\n\\nSection 15(1) of the PFMA, 2015 provides that “after approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the Secretary to Treasury shall issue the annual cash-flow plan of Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans and recruitment plans approved by Parliament”.\\n\\nIn addition, section 21(1) provides that “an Accounting Officer shall, based on the annual cash-flow plan issued by the Secretary to the Treasury under section 15, plan and manage the activities as indicated in the policy statement of the vote”.\\n\\nA review of the procurement plan and the procurement reports to PPDA indicated that procurements worth UGX.7,465,000,000 which were planned were not implemented.\\n\\nThe Ministry did not manage the procurement activities as indicated in the policy statement and hence not all planned services were delivered.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that some procurements were not implemented due to budget cuts and thus lack of funds.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to always liaise with the responsible authorities to ensure that the Ministry’s approved budget is fully availed.\\n\\n**9.0**\\n\\n# Delayed acquisition of land for the Right of Way (RoW) for the SGR project\\n\\nObjective 1 of the project strategic plan for 2016-2020 was to acquire 5200 acres of land free of encumbrances at an estimated cost of UGX 534,600,000,000 for the Right of Way (ROW) for the construction of Kampala – Malaba SGR route by October 2016.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHowever, the review of documents indicated that only 1,295.98 (24.9%) acres of land had been acquired at a cost of UGX.95,361,767,388 (18%) as of September 2021.\\n\\nIt was further noted that the project had not acquired titles for the pieces of land already paid for.\\n\\nDelayed acquisition of the Right of Way is likely to delay project implementation. As a result, the intended objectives of the project may not be achieved.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that currently, land acquisition is one of the core activities of the project. Valuation reports for the section between Tororo-Mayuge and Kakubansiri village in Buikwe district and Fish Ponds worth UGX 139.35bn were approved by the CGV starting from 2016. The amount paid to Project Affected Persons (PAPs) as compensation for land and property is directly dependent on the approved budgets and subsequent releases to the project. The releases however have been going down in comparison to the annual budgets. For example: in 2016/2017, UGX46.8bn was released out a budget of UGX113.5bn; in 2017/2018, UGX25.5bn was released out of a budget of UGX72.5bn; in 2018/2019, UGX25bn was released out of a budget of UGX39.2bn and in 2019/2020, UGX16.8bn was released out of a budget of UGX20bn. It is only in 2020/2021 where the budget was UGX19bn and all of it was released.  \\nThe Accounting Officer further explained that due to the passing of time from 2016 when assessment and valuation of PAPs in the section between Jinja-Kampala was done, reassessment and revaluation is on-going as advised by the CGV on this section where the compensation estimate was UGX 432.47bn in 2016.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to obtain and transfer land titles to Government for the land paid for and expedite the acquisition of all the land needed for the project.\\n\\n![](assets_MWTS%20Report%20of%20Auditor%20General%202021/img-1611.jpg)\\n\\nJohn F.S.

HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT\\n\\n# Opinion\\n\\nI have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June, 2022, the Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows together with other accompanying statements for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the financial statements of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) for the financial year ended 30 th June, 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.\\n\\n**Basis for Opinion**  \\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Section of my report. I am independent of Ministry of Works and Transport in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda.\\n\\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\n\\n**Key Audit Matter**  \\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. I have determined the matters described below to be key audit matters communicated in my report.\\n\\n**1.0**\\n\\n# Implementation of the Approved Budget\\n\\nParagraph 2 of schedule 5 of the PFMA requires Accounting Officers to prepare an appropriation account showing the services for which the money expended were voted, the sums actually expended on each service and the state of each vote compared with the amount appropriated for that vote by Parliament.\\n\\nOver the years, I have observed improvements in the performance regarding implementation of the budget but entities still face a number of challenges including COVID-19, which continue to affect implementation of activities, service delivery and\\n\\n---\\n\\ncredibility of the budget. It is against this background that budget performance was considered a key audit area during the office-wide planning. I reviewed documents such as work plans, performance reports, conducted interviews and physical inspection in arriving at my findings.\\n\\nThe MoWT is mandated to plan, develop and maintain an economic, efficient and effective transport infrastructure and services by road, rail, water, air and pipeline; manage public works including Government structures and promote good standards in the construction industry in support of the overall vision of government to bring about socio-economic transformation in the country.\\n\\nThe Ministry had a revised approved budget of UGX.836,607,573,082, out of which, UGX.767,113,898,027 was warranted. The Ministry’s key deliverables for the financial year under review were:-\\n\\n### Table 1: Key deliverables for MoWT for the year\\n\\n| **No** | **Output** | **Details** | **Budget (UGX) “000”** | **Cumulative % share of the total approved budget** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **1** | 52 | Contributions to National, Regional and International Organizations | 186,847,396 | 22.3 |  \\n| **2** | 83 | Border Post Rehabilitation/Construction | 178,584,883 | 43.6 |  \\n| **3** | 73 | Roads, Streets and Highways | 123,891,000 | 58.4 |  \\n| **4** | 80 | Construction/Rehabilitation of Inland Water Transport Infrastructure | 95,997,248 | 69.9 |  \\n| **5** | 05 | Water and Rail Transport Programmes Coordinated and Monitored. | 63,295,890 | 77.5 |  \\n| **6** | 81 | Construction/Rehabilitation of Railway Infrastructure | 60,591,014 | 84.7 |  \\n| **7** | 75 | Purchase of Motor Vehicles and Other Transport Equipment | 46,763,817 | 90.3 |  \\n| **8** | 02 | Road Safety Programmes Coordinated and Monitored | 24,651,296 | 93.2 |  \\n| **9** | 72 | Government Buildings and Administrative Infrastructure | 23,760,000 | 96 |  \\n| **10** | 01 | Policies, laws, guidelines, plans and strategies | 23,332,601 | 98.8 |  \\n||| **Total** | **827,715,145** | **98.8** |  \\n\\n\\nI reviewed the implementation of the approved 2021/2022 budget by the entity and noted the following.\\n\\n| **No** | **Observations** | **Recommendations** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| **1.1** | **Revenue Performance** ||  \\n|| **Performance of Non-Tax Revenue (NTR)**  I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.215.63Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.209.00Bn was collected, representing a performance of 97% of the target. was however, noted that the NTR target was set by MoFPED without the participation of the Accounting Officer. I could not therefore confirm whether this target was realistic. It | I advise the Accounting Officer to ensure that the promised action is followed up and implemented. |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n| The Accounting Officer explained that during the BFP preparation for FY 2023-24 the Ministry has engaged MoFPED to ensure that realistic NTR projections are made. |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **Performance of GoU receipts** |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n| According to the revised approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.836.61Bn, out of which UGX.767.1Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.69.51Bn. The shortfall represents 8.31% of the approved budget. funds that were not warranted were meant to facilitate the implementation of various outputs, which were either partially implemented or not implemented at all. The under funding for the affected outputs are included in **Appendix I.** Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry is in constant engagement with MOFPED to ensure full and timely release of the Ministry’s budget. The The |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advise the Accounting |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| Officer to continue |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| liaising with MoFPED to |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| ensure that that the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| approved budget is |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| fully warranted. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n| advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that activities and outputs are implemented as planned. I **Implementation of outputs and activities**  I assessed the implementation of a sample of twenty (22) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of one hundred and ten (110) activities worth UGX.693Bn and noted that; \\uf0b7 Five (5) outputs with eight (8) activities and expenditure worth UGX.294.6Bn were fully implemented.  \\uf0b7 Fifteen (15) outputs with ninety seven (97) activities worth UGX.390.4Bn were partially implemented. Out of the ninety seven (97) activities, the entity fully implemented thirty one (31) activities; forty (40) activities were partially implemented, while twenty six (26) activities remained unimplemented.  \\uf0b7 Two (2) outputs with five (5) activities worth UGX.8.1Bn were not implemented at all. the details of implementation of planned outputs, refer to the **Appendix II.** **2: Level of implementation of outputs** **Summary of Performance by Output** Activity details-Analysis** **Catego ry of output** **No of ou tp ut s** **% Propo rtion to total expen diture** **Tota l no of activ ities** **No of Fully imple mente d activiti es** **No.** Of partiall y implem ented activiti es** **of** **that** **No activitie** **s**  **were** not impleme nted** **Extent of impleme** **ntation** of activities per category of output** 5 42.5 8 8 0 0 100 15 50 56.3 97 31 40 26 50 **Exp end itur e UG X Bn** 294. 6 390. 4 **% Of i m** **e m e** **at io n** **Fully**  33 **imple**  **mente**  **d**  **output**  **s 1**  **Partiall**  **y**  **Imple**  **mente**  **d**  **output** s 2** **1.2** For  **Table** pl** **nt** |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n\\n\\n1 Fully implemented output -All the activities within the outputs are fully implemented  \\n2 Partially implemented Output-Activities within the output are either; Fully implemented, partially implemented or not implemented\\n\\n---\\n\\n| 2 17 8.1 1.17 5 0 0 5 0 **22 1 693 100 110 39 40 31** **0** 0** **Output s Not Imple mente** **d 3** Total** funding affected the implementation of panned activities. Non-implementation of planned activities implies that the expected services to the beneficiary communities were not attained.

Under The |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|  \\n| **1.3** Mischarges** |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<||  \\n| Regulation 16 (1) of the Public Finance and Management Regulations, 2016, requires an Accounting Officer to request the Minister for approval to vary, within a vote, the amount of money allocated to the vote. 10.3.1 (step 4-approval of payments) states that in reviewing payment requests, an Accounting Officer shall have a primary responsibility of ensuring that there is no mischarge and diversion of funds through wrong coding of transactions. An Accounting Officer shall be held personally liable for any wrong charge accounts used for expenditure incurred by his/her vote From a sample of transactions reviewed, I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.2,097,464,868 were irregularly mischarged from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Details of cases where this was observed are in **Appendix III.** of funds is not only contrary to the Public Finance and Management Act, but it negatively affects the delivery of services and negates the purpose of budgeting. Accounting Officer explained that during the financial year, the Ministry budgeted to support regional workshops for the maintenance and repair of earth moving equipment which fall under force account, interconnectivity and DRRU units. These funds were transferred to the regional workshops to cater for outstanding bills for the Japanese Equipment to avert a crisis at the local Government, District and Municipal council. Paragraph Mischarge The |<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| I advised the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| Accounting Officer to |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| ensure that charging of |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| expenditure is based |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| on the expenditure |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| classification and |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| coding as defined by |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| the chart of Accounts |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| and not reasons for the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| expenditure. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| Furthermore, the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| Accounting Officer is |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| advised to advocate for |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| increasing in the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| budget to support the |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<| regional workshops. |  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n|^|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|<|^|  \\n\\n\\n**1.4**\\n\\n# Delivery of services from implemented activities\\n\\nI under took procedures to establish if activities were undertaken in timely manner, were of expected quality and quantity, and if citizens were getting the expected services. The following observations were noted;\\n\\n**a) Maintenance of district and zonal road equipment**  \\nI carried out inspection of the regional mechanical workshops and established that 23 Districts’ road equipment, especially Motor graders remained in the Workshops’\\n\\n3 Outputs not implemented-All the activities within the output not implemented at all\\n\\n---\\n\\nyards for more than a year without repair with some having been grounded since 2016.\\n\\nThis has affected the maintenance of roads in the affected districts.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Regional Workshops received only UGX.10,492,000,000 as operational funding against an actual requirement of UGX.45,000,000,000 thereby not able to carry out all the necessary repairs.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to lobby the responsible authorities and have the road equipment maintenance budget improved.\\n\\n**b) Grounded Aircrafts at the East African civil Aviation Academy**  \\nThe inspection of the East African civil Aviation Academy (Soroti Flying School) indicated that all its nine (9) training aircrafts were grounded due to the expiry of their insurance or being faulty. I further noted that three aircrafts involved in accidents during the year under review had not been repaired due to the delayed compensation by the insurance service provider.  \\nThe training of pilots had been suspended resulting into un-necessary costs of keeping students on the campus without training and extension of the time within which students would complete their courses. In addition salaries for the Instructors and staff are being paid without activities, which is wasteful.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the financial challenges have derailed the Academy from executing its mandate. It was further explained that the Academy procured an insurance service provider (Sanlam), however after accepting the offer, the Academy received a late communication from Sanlam declining to offer the service. The issue has however been escalated to the Attorney General for further guidance on the next action against Sanlam Insurance. In addition, 5X-UAN 310 aircraft was manufactured in 1978 whose production line had been stopped, hence the Academy had to make special arrangements for the production of the parts required. It should also be noted that the aircraft was undergoing major structural repairs which required lots of parts.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to engage relevant authorities to ensure that the insurance cover is renewed and urgently follow up with the insurance provider for compensation of the aircrafts involved in accidents. Management of Ministry of Works should work out a strategy for enhancing the revenues of the Academy.\\n\\n**2.0**\\n\\n# Management of Public Land\\n\\nSection 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) requires the Accounting Officers to be responsible for the management of the land under their custody. Public land management is the process by which public land resources are put to proper utilization. Paragraph 16.13.11 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that for a government entity to be considered to have control over land only when it has the title.\\n\\nThe current financial reporting framework requires Land to be recognized as Non- produced assets in the statement of financial position (effective 2014) for all reporting entities on both Modified accrual and accrual basis of Accounting. The framework further requires land procured prior to 2014, and where the value cannot\\n\\n---\\n\\nbe ascertained to be recorded in the memorandum statement to the financial statements.\\n\\nI observed that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and Local Governments (LGs) have challenges with regard to planning and budgeting, protecting, reporting, utilization and disposal of Public Land. These challenges include; inadequate record keeping, non-compliance to recognition and measurement criteria, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, and lack of land titles, among others. These have negatively affected the quality of financial statements, and hampered service delivery and fulfilment of entity mandates.\\n\\nDocuments, such as; Laws and Regulations, approved strategic plans, policy statements, budgets, Financial Statements, Asset Register, Court case files and correspondences, Land titles and lease files were reviewed. In addition, I interacted with entity management and discussed issues affecting public land management. Furthermore, I physically inspected some of the pieces of land owned by the entities.\\n\\nFrom the procedures undertaken, I noted the following:-\\n\\n| **SN** | **Observation** | **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|  \\n| **2.1** | **Recording of land in IFMS and presentation in the** **financial statements**  Paragraph 10.12.4 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 requires all fixed assets acquired to be captured in the fixed asset module of the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS)-IFMS A review of the land register and land transactions during the period under review revealed that the land acquired under the SGR project, measuring approximately 1,305.886 acres costing UGX.99,343,193,128 were not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. to record all land in the land register could lead to misstatement of the non-produced asset in the statement of financial position and in the summary statement of stores and other assets (physical assets). he Accounting Officer explained that with the upgrading of the IFMS - assets module has been operationalized and the SGR land which had been acquired over the years will be uploaded on the IFMS as we have done for the Ministry. T Failure | advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all entity land is updated in the GFMIS asset module and appropriately presented and disclosed in the financial statements. I |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Other Matter\\n\\nI consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the Financial Statements;\\n\\n# 3.0 Un-Recovered Advance Payment-EURO.8,854,839.68\\n\\nThe PSST/National Authorising Officer of the European Development Fund (EDF)- Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (PSST/NAO) signed a contract with an International firm for civil works for the rehabilitation of the Tororo- Gulu Railway at a contract price of EUR.39,337,756 (excluding VAT/other taxes). This included EU component of EUR.17,526,000 and GoU of EUR.21,811,756.\\n\\nArticle 46.8-a of the contract (pre-financing) required that repayment of pre- financing shall take the form of deductions based on monthly claims. The flat rate pre-financing (maximum of 10%) shall be repaid by means of deductions from instalment and, if necessary, the balance due to the contractor. This repayment shall begin with the first instalment and be completed; at the very latest by the time 80% of the amount of the Contract has been paid.\\n\\nI noted that the contractor terminated the contract on 12 th July, 2022 due to failure by the Government of Uganda to honour payments. A review of payment certificates and Supervising Consultant reports established that, although 30% advance payment was made to the contractor amounting to EUR.11,801,326.80, by the time of termination of the contract, only EUR.2,946,487.12 had been recovered with the balance EUR.8,854,839.68 not yet recovered.\\n\\nAn inspection carried out during the audit of Uganda Railways Corporation, which was the contract manager, indicated that by the time of termination of the contract, the old railway line had been dismantled by the contractor in several areas. This exposed the dismantled but re-usable materials to theft.\\n\\nThere is a risk of loss of public funds of EUR.8,218,950.59 since the outstanding un- paid certificates amounted to only EUR.635,889.09. In addition, some or all the dismantled but re-usable materials may ultimately not be traceable.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the outstanding advance payment is still secured by advance and pre-financing security bonds provided by the contractor at commencement which are in the custody of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development which are valid up to the intended completion date of 9 th February, 2023 as per the requirements of the contract.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the various stakeholders with a view of coming up with interventions to ensure that the rehabilitation of the Tororo-Gulu Railway is completed.\\n\\n# Other Information\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer of Ministry of Works and Transport is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement of responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and the commentaries by the Head of Accounts and the Accounting Officer, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\n# Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\\n\\nUnder Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, the Accounting Officer is accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of MoWT.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is also responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Public Finance and Management Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Ministry\\\\`s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Accounting Officer has a realistic alternative to the contrary.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer is responsible for overseeing the Ministry\\\\`s financial reporting process.\\n\\n# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISSAIs, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:-\\n\\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls in the Ministry.\\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Ministry’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I\\n\\n---\\n\\nam required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Ministry to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\nI communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n\\nI also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\n\\n**Other Reporting Responsibilities**  \\nIn accordance with Section 19 (1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of Financial Statements, that; except for the matters raised in compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.\\n\\n# Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation\\n\\nIn accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of the Ministry with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.\\n\\nThe material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows:-\\n\\n**4.0**\\n\\n# Management of Information Technology (IT) Investments in Government\\n\\nThe Government of Uganda (GOU) is making large investments in Information Technology (IT) systems because of the tremendous benefits that IT can bring to its operations and services. One of the key programmes of NDPIII 2020/21-2024/25 is Digital Transformation, in which Government of Uganda aims to increase Information, Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use of digital services for enhancing social and economic development.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a result of national prioritisation of IT, the Auditor General undertook a thematic audit covering three financial years’ expenditure (2019/20 to 2021/22) to scrutinise the management of IT Investments across Government. The overall objective was to assess whether the IT investments in Government are strategically aligned, managed appropriately and focused on achieving the NDP III objective. The procedures undertaken covered: planning and budgeting; procurement, utilization, maintenance and disposal of IT systems; governance, and financial reporting.\\n\\nFor the current year 2021/2022, the entity budgeted for UGX.5,572,875,000 for acquisition and implementation of IT systems and equipment and received UGX.4,793,109,187.\\n\\nA review of IT activities implemented revealed the following:\\n\\n| **SN** | **Observation** |<|<|<|<|<|<| **Recommendation** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **4.1** | **Procurement/Development and Use of Software/Licenses (IT Systems) and Equipment** The IT Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) requires a systematic approach which includes; initiation, planning and execution. In addition, I made my assessment basing on PS/ST and NITA-U guidance on IT developments which aim to promote rationalisation and avoid further development of isolated IT systems in MDAs and LGs. During the audit of the Ministry, I observed that a total of two (2) IT systems/equipment with a total cost of UGX.200,780,000 were implemented without business cases and approval by NITA-U. The **table** below refers. **Table 3: IT systems procured without business cases** **Purpose of** the System** **Cost of the System (UGX.)** **User Department** 4,900,000 All departments **Name of IT System** Undefined PTV Visum Modeler Biometric software system upgrade Transport planning software **Total** **Date of purchas e** 6/6/202 2 19/11/2 021 195,880,000 Directorate of Transport services **200,780,000** may lead to duplication of acquisition, procurement of non-compatible solutions and equipment; and general deviation from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service delivery. be approved by NITA-U before they are initiated by the Ministry.

However, a review of the ICT governance structure of the entity revealed that; i. There were no specific structures that steer and oversee IT implementation.  ii. The entity has nine (9) positions of IT staff on the establishment, out of which, four (4) (44%) were filled and have the required qualifications. **The table below refers.** |<|<|<|<|<|<| advised the Accounting Officer to institute governance policies and structures and to fill vacant positions to effectively manage IT investments. I |  \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\niii. There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.  \\niv. There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014.\\n\\n### Table 4: IT staffing levels\\n\\n##### Position Per Establishment No. of No. of Vacant Approved Positions Positions Positions Filled\\n\\nPrincipal Information 1 0 1 Technologist  \\nSenior Information scientist 1 0 1 Senior Information Technologist 2 2 0 Librarian 1 0 1 Web Master 1 1 0 Information Technologist 2 1 1 Systems administrator 1 0 1\\n\\n##### Total 9 4 5\\n\\nAbsence of IT governance structures and understaffing hampers formulation of appropriate IT policies, strategies and real time upgrade of IT interventions. In addition, it may lead to misalignment of IT investments with the overall entity strategic objectives.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry will ensure that a structure is set up to steer and oversee IT implementation in consultation with other stakeholders. It was further explained that the Ministry is in the process of initiating engagements with NITA-U to provide support to enable it undertake recovery of any data to aid business continuity.\\n\\n**5.0**\\n\\n# Implementation of the PDM by Ministry of Works and Transport\\n\\nThe Parish Development Model (PDM) is a strategy by the Government of Uganda aimed at organizing and delivering the public and private sectors out of poverty through the creation of employment opportunities at the lowest economic planning unit, the Parish. The Parish Development Model (PDM) is the last mile strategy for service delivery by Government of Uganda to improve the incomes and welfare of all Ugandans at the household level.\\n\\nThe Parish Development Model is expected to cover all the 10,594 parishes in Uganda and is premised on seven major pillars: The primary pillar is “Agriculture value chain development (Production, Storage, Processing and Marketing). The achievement of this pillar is supported by six other pillars namely; infrastructure and economic services, financial inclusion, social services, community mobilization, mind- set change Parish-based management information system, and governance and administration.\\n\\nPillar Two (2) – Infrastructure and Economic Services supports the provision of reliable transport and economic services for production and marketing.\\n\\nThe roles of the Ministry of Works and Transport are to;  \\ni.  \\nChair the Pillar Working Group  \\nii.  \\nConstruct and maintain community access roads  \\niii.  \\nImprove check points/bridges on community roads  \\niv.  \\nUpgrade community local markets by developing marketing strategy\\n\\n---\\n\\nv.  \\nExtend safe water facilities for domestic use and production  \\nvi.  \\nExtend of power facilities to communities and ensure availability of power in each Parish  \\nvii.  \\nCreate free internet zones in communities  \\nviii. Improve physical development planning to facilitate planned, waste management and renewable energy\\n\\nI reviewed the implementation of the PDM activities and noted the following;-\\n\\n**5.1**\\n\\n# Implementation of the expected deliverables before full roll out of the PDM\\n\\nAccording to the approved PDM Policy Framework, 2022, the Ministry of Works and Transport was supposed to undertake a number of activities before the full roll out of the PDM to ensure that the Pillar objectives are achieved. I undertook verification of the extent to which these activities had been implemented and noted that out of six (6) activities, only one (1) had been implemented at the time of audit as per the details below;\\n\\n| **S/N** | **Pillar activity** | **What should be in place before full roll out** | **Implemented (Yes/No)** |  \\n|---|---|---|---|  \\n| **1** | Construction and maintenance of Community Access roads | Identification or existence of a database of all the roads to be worked on facilitate implementation of the PDM to | No |  \\n| **2** | Improve choke points and bridges on community roads | Identification or existence of a database of all the choke points to be worked on facilitate implementation of the PDM to | No |  \\n| **3** | Upgrade community local markets by developing a marketing strategy | An approved marketing strategy | No |  \\n| **4** | Creation of free internet zones | Free internet zones identified and created | No |  \\n| **5** | Functional Pillar working group | 1 pillar working group | Yes |  \\n| **6** | Pillar manual | 1 pillar manual | No |  \\n\\n\\nDue to the failure to fully implement the above activities before full roll out there is a risk that implementation of the pillar activities will face challenges which may impair the achievement of the pillar objectives.\\n\\nManagement explained that the non-implementation is attributed to the absence of a budget provision to implement the activities as per the framework.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with the relevant stakeholders to obtain the necessary resources to implement the activities as per the PDM policy framework.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**6.0** Delayed Completion of the consultancy for the unit cost study for road**\\n\\n# construction and maintenance in Uganda\\n\\nOn 30 th July 2019, the Ministry entered into a contract for a unit cost study for road construction and maintenance in Uganda at a contract price of UGX.2,102,966,500. The contract was to be executed in nine (9) months from the date of contract signing, implying that the contract completion date was supposed to be 30 th April, 2020.\\n\\nA review of the performance of the contract revealed the following:-\\n\\ni. Although the cumulative payments to the consultant totalled to UGX.1,472,076,550 (70% of the contract price) by end of September 2022, almost 2 & ½ years later, most aspects of the contract such as testing the cost management system, 2 nd stakeholders’ workshop, final report, cost estimation and monitoring systems and implementation strategy had not been delivered.\\n\\nii.  \\nAlthough, section 7.6 of Terms of Reference(TORs) for the study required six (6) staff from MoWT, UNRA, KCCA and Uganda Road Fund to be attached to the Consultant as counterpart staff for training and knowledge transfer, there was no evidence that it was done.\\n\\niii.  \\nThe most recent report submitted by the Consultant was the draft final report in December 2020. This report was not approved by the Ministry as it reportedly lacked cost drivers for road maintenance.\\n\\nThere is a risk of loss of UGX.1,472,076,550 so far paid to the Consultant if no acceptable report is eventually delivered. In addition, there was no evidence that the Ministry was employing the penalty provisions in the contract.\\n\\nThe Accounting Officer explained that the Consultancy has been delayed because of a number of issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak and the insufficient data that has been gathered from key stakeholders both internally and outside the benchmarking countries. It is important to highlight that access to offices and documents was necessary for the majority of the Consultancy's primary activities.\\n\\nI advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the Consultant to ensure that the report is delivered expeditiously to enhance decision making.\\n\\n![](assets_MWTS%20Report%20of%20Auditor%20General%202022/img-2941.jpg)\\n\\nJohn F.
