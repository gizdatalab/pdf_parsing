FOREWORD BY THE AUDITOR GENERAL

In accordance with my audit mandate set out under Article 163 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995, as amended, the National Audit Act 2008 and the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, as amended, I hereby present to you the Annual Audit Report on the Consolidated Public Accounts of Uganda; Local Government, and Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations, and State Enterprises and Companies in which Government has a controlling interest.

In line with the above mandate, I audited financial statements for 186 MDAs, 83 Statutory Corporations and 151 Local Governments. In addition, I undertook four (4) thematic audits covering: Payroll management in Local Governments following last year's audit outcomes that necessitated deepening payroll audit procedures; Management of IT investments across Government; Management of Public Land; and Implementation of the Approved Budget for the 3 rd time since 2019/2020 financial year, to ensure that the appropriated funds are spent appropriately as planned.

The Office's commitment to undertake audits that add value to society remains my main focus. However, during the year, the emergency of Ebola, insecurity in the Karamoja region as well as limited staff resources affected audit activities in the affected areas. These audits will be performed in the 2 nd half of this financial year 2022/2023.

I extend my gratitude to the Government of Uganda and all other stakeholders for the support rendered to my Office during the audit year to ensure the continued delivery of my mandate. I also thank my staff for their steady commitment and support towards undertaking audits aimed at improving `the well-being of Citizens’.

1.3 Summary of Audit Results

1.3.1 General Performance

At the beginning of the year, I undertook the Shared Overall Risk Assessment (SORA) which determined the planned audits to be undertaken in 2022 Audit Year. The SORA profiled all the audits under the mandate based on different risk factors. Out of the total population of 17,494, 3,996 (21%) with a total budget of (UGX.43.42Tn) representing 97% of the total GoU budget were selected for audit.

A total of 2,056 audits which includes schools and tertiary institutions could not be completed due to the effects of Ebola pandemic, insurgencies in Karamoja region and resource constraints. The restricted movement in Mubende and Kassanda districts disrupted the audit schedules and 5 HLGs of Karenga DLG, Kaabong DLG, Kotido DLG, Kotido MC, Abim DLG have not been audited due to security concerns.

The forensic investigations and special audit reports have been issued to the respective stakeholders who requested for them. The summary is in Table 1 below and details are in Annexure I.

PART 2: REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.0. REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion

I have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of the Republic of Uganda for the year ended 30 th June 2022. These financial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement together with other accompanying statements, notes, and accounting policies.

In my opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th June 2022 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis of Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Treasury in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended), the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B) (IESBA Code), and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda. I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code, and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in Uganda. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Key Audit Matter











Over the years, I have observed improvements in the performance regarding implementation of the budget but entities still face a number of challenges including Covid-19, which continue to affect implementation of activities, service delivery and credibility of the budget. It is against this background that budget performance was considered a key audit area during the office- wide planning. I reviewed documents such as work plans, performance reports, conducted interviews and physical inspection in arriving at my findings.

The approved initial revenue and expenditure budget estimates of the Government of Uganda were UGX.44.8Tn. This was later revised, with the revenue budget being increased to UGX.47.2Tn while the expenditure budget was increased to UGX.51.6Tn. A total of UGX.48.9Tn was finally warranted to implement Government programmes. I reviewed the implementation of the approved 2021/2022 budget by Government and noted the following;

Table 4: Showing findings from review of Budget Performance No Observation Recommendation 1.1 Revenue Performance

A review of the approved budget estimates of the The PS/ST was advised to Government of Uganda for the financial year ended 30 th continue exploring more June 2022 revealed that the initial approved revenue avenues of ensuring that all budget was UGX.44.8Tn. This was later budgeted revenue is always revised/increased by UGX.2.4Tn to UGX.47.2Tn. realised to fund the budget However, UGX.44.4Tn was realised representing as approved. 94.2% revenue performance level.

Although the performance is commendable, the shortfall implies that government could not fully finance its planned programmes, which in turn affected service delivery.

The Accounting Officer explained that while tax revenues were affected by poor economic conditions in 2021/22, the overall performance was very good. He further stated that Non-Tax Revenue collections were affected by the general slow economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19.

1.2 Utilization/expenditure of Funds

Out of the total available funds of UGX.48.9Tn warranted The PS/ST was advised to during the financial year, UGX.44.4Tn was spent by explore strategies aimed at Government resulting into an unutilized balance of addressing implementation UGX.4.5Tn representing a performance level of challenges and also consider 90.93%.The summary is shown in the table below;











No Observation Recommendation				
observed that the failure to utilize the funds was attributed to the following;Some entities could not raise invoices to utilise all the funds available to them, due to implementation challenges and late release of funds. b) There was a mismatch between total funds issued and the total actual revenue collections, resulting into a funding gap.The PS/ST stated that in the FY 2021/22, the economy was slowly recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and the projected revenues were not realised. However, the Ministry is committed to ensuring that Budget preparation and execution is credible. To enhance revenues, Government is implementing the Domestic Revenue Mobilisation Strategy, while on the expenditure side, Government has re-prioritised interventions to fit the resource envelop and in line with the NDP III. This will ensure revenues are matched with expenditure.Ia)				
1.3	Un-funded Approved Budget			
				
	The PFMA, 2015 Section 15 (1) and (2) requires that after		The PS/ST was advised to	
	approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the		ensure that all	
	Secretary to the Treasury shall issue the annual cash flow		supplementary expenditure	
	plan of Government, based on the procurement plans,		approvals are supported with	
	work plans, and recruitment plans approved by		supplementary sources of	
	parliament. The annual cash flow plan shall form the basis		financing to ensure that the

	Section 25(1) of the Public Finance and Accountability Act			
	(PFMA) stipulates that the total supplementary			
	expenditure that requires additional resources over and			
	above what is approved by Parliament shall not exceed			
	3% of the total approved budget for that financial year,			
	without the approval of Parliament.			
				
	Whereas the initial budget appropriated by Parliament			
	was balanced (i.e. Revenue estimates equaled			
	expenditure estimates), I noted that the revised budget			
	as a result of supplementaries, had revenue estimates of			
	UGX.47.2Tn as compared to expenditure estimates of			
	UGX.51.6Tn, creating a budget deficit of UGX.4.4Tn.			
				
	Continued approval of supplementary budgets without a			
	corresponding increase in revenue/financing, leads to			
	increased funding gap that affects the earlier budget			
	objectives and plans. For example, whereas the

	shortfalls in budgets.

	was issued against targeted borrowings and enhanced			
	revenue mobilization measures that did not materialize.			
	However, going forward, supplementary funding will be			
	issued against confirmed funding sources of inflows to			
	avoid unfunded activities and over commitments.			
				
Section 6 of the Budget Execution Circular for the FY 2021/22 provides that all work plans and Budgets for FY2021/22 are prepared and approved using the Program Budgeting System (PBS). All Budgets, irrespective of the source of financing (GoU, NTR/AIA, Donor or LG Revenue), will be migrated and loaded into the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) to facilitate Budget Implementation and reporting.1.4 Budgeting for Non-Tax Revenueto the approved Budget estimates for the FY2021/22, it was projected that a total of UGX.1.59Tn would be collected as NTR. Review of Program Based Budgeting (PBB) tool used by the Government and IFMS records revealed that that NTR budgets for the respective MDAs were neither uploaded on PBS nor IFMS. The budgeting tool only had details regarding expenditure, and no revenue was included. I further noted that several Accounting Officers disowned the figures incorporated the NTR Estimates book, indicating that they had not been consulted in arriving at the estimates incorporated there in.As a result, I was unable to compare respective entity budget figures with the URA NTR collections that totaled to UGX.2.42Tn. Absence of proper revenue estimates for each entity undermines transparency, affects motivation of staff, and hampers performance assessment.explained that the PBS system has been enhanced and effective FY 2023/24, all Votes have budgeted NTR online and is uploaded into the IFMS.

2.2 UNSPENT BALANCES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

As reflected in the Consolidated Fund Statement on page 30 of the financial statements, prior year unspent balances amounting to UGX.29.41Bn (2020/2021: UGX.26.05Bn) were applied as part of the monies to fund the budget for FY2021/2022. Given that such balances arise out of the GoU Appropriation that expires at the end of the year in line with the PFMA 2015, its application in the subsequent financial year would require that a supplementary appropriation is sought before utilising the said balances.

This omission in the sources of funds available to fund the budget leads to distortions in form of an understatement of the country’s available resources for spending.

The PS/ST explained that indeed all GoU Appropriations expire at the end of the year in line with the PFMA 2015. However, it should be noted that GoU has been operating a deficit budget and therefore any residual unspent funds form part of the opening balances. All eligible requests for re-voting, that are submitted with proper justification, the unspent balances are provided as supplementary, for example for external funding, which is already provided through supplementary budgets since it necessitates adjustments to appropriation and work plans for the current year.

I advised PS/ST going forward, to consider explicitly seeking a supplementary appropriation for all such unspent balances.

2.3 GOVERNMENT LOANS (BORROWINGS) – UGX.77.97Tn

As disclosed in the statement of financial performance, the government Loans have increased from UGX.69.60Tn in 2021, to UGX.77.97Tn in 2022 constituting an increase of UGX.8.36Tn (12%). This position reflects an increase in borrowing that could make debt payment unsustainable for the country.

Management indicated that they intend to address the increasing public debt through implementation of the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) by aligning Government’s priority programmes and restricting borrowing to critical projects.

2.4 PAYABLES – UGX.7.545Tn











undertaking measures that limit supplementary budgets with no matching grants, that end up impacting on already identified and appropriated revenue sources.

2.5 PENSION LIABILITIES - UGX.442.98Bn

As disclosed in the statement of public debt, Pension liabilities increased from UGX.162.3Bn in 2021 to UGX.442.98Bn in 2022, representing of an increase of UGX.280.68Bn (173%). I noted that the Ministry of Information, Communication and National Guidance had the most significant amount of UGX.320Bn, arising out of the former employees of the defunct Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Limited. The continued failure to settle the pension arrears impacts on the welfare of the pensioners.

I advised PS/ST to prioritise payment of pension arrears going forward.

2.6 CLASSIFIED EXPENDITURE – UGX.780Bn

As disclosed under Note 8, a total of UGX.780Bn relates to classified expenditure. In compliance with Section 24 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (Classified Expenditure), this expenditure is audited separately and a separate audit report issued.

Other Matter

I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements;

2.7 PUBLIC DEBT 2.7.1 Portfolio Analysis

The reported total public debt as at 30 th June, 2022 stood at UGX.86.6Tn (2020/2021: UGX.75.1Tn), of which Domestic Debt Stock was UGX.38.1Tn and the External Debt Stock was valued at UGX.48.5Tn. This is an increase of UGX.11.5Tn, equivalent to 12.5% when compared to the debt stock of UGX.75.1Tn reported as at 30 th June 2021. Table below shows the details;

I observed that Public debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of Government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, Bond switches, private placements, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. The graph below illustrates the trend of public debt stock by type over the past five years;

2. OAG Analysis: Public Debt Portfolio

Although Government has strengthened the budgeting process and reduced the number of unwarranted supplementary budget expenditure, this appears not to be in harmony with the continuing Government expenditure, raising concerns of debt sustainability.

Management explained that Government intends to address the concerns raised through the following ways;

i. Implementation of the Public Investment Financing Strategy (PIFS) by aligning appropriate financing to Government’s priority programmes.

ii. Borrowing will be restricted for projects/expenditures that are critical to the economy.

iii. Instituting a more stringent process for prioritizing, vetting, rescheduling programmes and projects to be financed using borrowed resources in the next FY and medium term.











I advised Government to devise a comprehensive strategy aligning revenue mobilisation and fiscal management.

2.7.2 Analysis of External Debt

Uganda’s external debt as at 30 th June 2022 is made up of Multilateral Creditors (UGX.29.9Tn), Bilateral Creditors (UGX.13.5Tn) and Commercial Banks (UGX.5Tn). Refer to the figure below;

External Debt

Multilateral Creditors

10% Bilateral Creditors

28%

Figure 3: OAG Analysis: External Debt

Analysis of the trend of external debt over the last five years revealed a linear growth in the level of external debt over the years. There has been a consistent increase from UGX.28.4Tn in the Financial Year 2017/18 to UGX.48.4Tn in 2021/22, representing an overall growth of 70.6% over the period. The details are given in Table and graph below;

3. OAG External debt analysis

It was established that the major driver of the growth is the contraction of new debt mainly for budget support, which has put pressure on the economy and has led to further borrowing from the domestic market. However, there is a risk that this may not be sustainable in the short term.

The Accounting Officer stated that Government intends to borrow largely on favourable terms by first exhausting concessional financing options to finance government projects. Government will continue to implement Domestic Revenue Mobilization efforts which will help in reducing the fiscal deficit and relive government on expensive borrowings.

G overnment is advised to review the rate of contracting debt and also devise strategies to increase domestic revenue collections to enable servicing of the debt obligations.

2.7.3 Movement of Domestic Debt Stock

Domestic debt portfolio is composed of long term borrowings (Treasury Bonds and Government Bonds), short-term borrowings (Treasury Bills and Government overdraft/temporary advances), Court Awards, principal and Interest payment.

The country’s domestic debt stock, which is mainly on Treasury Bonds and Treasury Bills, and un-securitised debt amounted to UGX.38.15Tn as of 30 th June 2022 (2021: UGX.30.81Tn). Trends for the past four years of domestic debt portfolio are shown respectively in table below;

Table 7: Showing domestic debt stock for the past four years FY Domestic Debt Stock (face Increase value) UGX-Tn UGX (Tn) % 2021/22 38.1 7.3 23.7 2020/21 30.8 12.9 71.5 2019/20 18 2.5 16.0 2018/19 15.5 2.4 18.7 2017/18 13.1

From the above analysis, it can be deduced as follows;

a)

All Government instruments that have reached maturity/redemption are financed through debt rollover (borrowing to pay existing debt) and this has created a high dependence on the market and thus increases refinancing risk. Under subscription was observed, due to highly priced bids that were rejected in a bid to reduce the cost of debt.

b)

In the year under audit, a decrease of 31% was registered in Net Domestic Financing (NDF) from UGX.6.7Tn to UGX.4.6Tn. However, it should be noted that the decrease in net domestic financing was as a result of under subscription of treasury instruments as the approved NDF for the FY was UGX.5.5Tn.

Continued reliance on Net Domestic Financing, signals Government’s borrowing appetite, whereby the market players are inclined to demand increased rates well aware that Government is in dire need to finance the budget. In addition, the commercial banks will prefer lending to Government instead of the private sector thus affecting growth in the private sector.

Management explained that GoU has two options to handle redemptions. Firstly, it can opt for an outright settlement of these obligations and secondly, rollover. The first option is not feasible, as this will constrain the budget. Further to note, with the introduction of Primary Dealer Reforms in 2020, GoU no longer has a challenge of under subscriptions (since PDs are obligated to fully fund auctions).

The UGX.6.7Tn NDF in FY2020/21, was necessitated by the low tax revenue that was occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. After full re-opening of the economy, NDF for the subsequent FY was naturally reduced to UGX.5.5Tn, which was accordingly mobilized. GoU is implementing the DRMS which is envisaged to reduce on the fiscal deficit. Further to this, GoU is pursuing fiscal consolidation, evidenced by deliberate reduction in NDF for FY2022/23 and the medium term.











2.7.4 The Cost to Government for using Private Placements - UGX.1.2Tn

Section 1.4 (C) of the Guidelines for selling Uganda Government Securities through Non- Calendar Auctions and Private Placement Mechanism 2019 provides that the use of non- calendar auctions and private placements shall be on a purely exceptional basis and as a last resort. This is intended to minimize the secondary bond market price distortions that may result from the off-calendar increased stock supply, and the potential subsequent impact on primary auctions and the cost of borrowing through increased rates.

I observed that UGX.510.8Tn was borrowed from the domestic market on the 29 th June 2022 using a private placement. I noted that this domestic borrowing was outside the approved auction-calendar dates. I further noted that the use of private placements to raise funding attracted higher interest charges of UGX.1.2Tn due to absence of competition. Refer to Table below;

Government borrowing through private placements and use of non-calendar auction days distorts the domestic markets leading to higher interest rates paid by government.

Management explained that Government required these funds as part of a structural benchmark requirement with IMF on partial reimbursements to BoU. It was not practically possible to have raised these funds from the domestic market through the auction calendar.











I observed that among other challenges, the Treasury was facing cash flow constraints. The Treasury requested BoU to switch Bonds totalling to UGX.0.9Tn in two consecutive financial years (FY2020/21 and FY2021/22) which resulted into accumulation of accrued interest totalling to UGX.1.184Tn over a period of years. Refer to table below;

Total 905.5 129.4 1184.1

While the intent of bond switches is to postpone redemption of maturing debt, it creates incremental debt at new/prevailing interest rates which are not favourable to Government as it increases the Public debt. It was further noted that in the same two financial years, the Treasury rolled over debt to a tune UGX.14.6Tn in domestic debt.

Management stated that in the recent past, MoFPED has carried out two bond switches. In FY2020/21, a successful switch was conducted (favourable yields) with advantages such as: increased the average maturity of the debt portfolio and increased liquidity of benchmark securities (deepens financial market). In FY2021/22, again, GoU was obliged to honour high redemptions. Practically, they had three options;

i- to budget and retire this obligation (was feasible-GoU operated a deficit budget);

ii- let BoU pay on their behalf and let her obligation became part of the accumulated reimbursements to BoU. This would not make any difference, because the Central bank charges GoU, interest equivalent to the prevailing market rates;











2.7.6 Debt to GDP Ratio

The Debt to GDP ratio is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service provided). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a Country to pay both internal and external debt and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates to compensate for financing risk due to likely default or unnecessary debt extension.

Though the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, the developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold.

A re-computation of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a consistent linear growth over a period of five years as Debt to GDP grew by 21% from 31% to 52%. The graph below illustrates the movement;

From the above, it can be seen that though Uganda’s GDP has been increasing over the years since FY2016/17, its debt position has also increased. The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk factor of accumulation of unsustainable debt.











slightly above the 50% policy threshold by the end of FY2021/22 and to peak at 53.1% in FY2022/23, before gradually reducing to below 50% by the end of FY2025/26.

The Accounting Officer should consider alternative ways of reducing dependence on debt while exploring avenues of enhancing revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures.

2.7.7 Interest to Total Revenue Ratio

This benchmark shows the proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestically-raised component of the budget only. The table below shows the assessment of the benchmark over the years;

Table 11: Showing interest to total revenue ratio Financial Total domestic Revenue Total Interest – % of Interest to Bench year – UGX.Tn UGX.Tn revenue mark 2021/22 22.8 5.5 24.1 <12.5

2020/21 20.2 3.1 15.4 <12.5 2019/20 17.5 2.5 14.2 <12.5 2018/19 17.1 2.0 11.71 <12.5 2017/18 15.2 1.9 12.73 <12.5

It has been established that the interest to revenue benchmark has been overwhelmingly breached as evidenced above. It has been noted that 24.1% of the revenue being collected is going into servicing interest payments. This is gradually reducing the funds available for funding other critical Government expenditures.

I advised the PS/ST to devise strategies of reducing the growth of interest expenditures at the same time increasing revenue mobilisation.

2.7.8 Use of Non-concessional loans for Budget support – UGX.4.5Tn

The Government Medium Term Debt Strategy has for the past five financial years restricted non concessional/commercial loans to financing infrastructure and self - financing projects through on-lent agreements that have the capacity of generating non tax revenue to enable debt repayment. This has been done in the spirit of ensuring long term debt sustainability.

Banks Total 4.5

In the past, budget support has been financed by grants, domestic debt (i.e. T-bills and T- Bonds), concessional loans with very generous terms and internally generated revenue. Non- concessional debt financing will increase financial leverage and financial risk. It will reduce the government’s liquidity, given the fact that commercial loans do not give longer grace periods of debt repayment as compared to concessional loans. Commercial bank debt often has higher interest rates and contracting fees which is never a requirement for concessional loans. The country further runs a risk of losing its national key assets in the event of default.

Management explained that concessional financing is limited and Government has been forced to borrow from semi-concessional institutions to meet its liquidity obligations.

Management is advised to consider financing Budget support with loans that have concessional terms, to avoid high interest payments and very short grace periods.

2.7.9 Continued high Commitment Fees

Commitment fees are paid for debt that has been contracted but not yet disbursed. I performed a trend analysis of commitment fees over the past five years and noted that a total of UGX.359.5Bn was paid as commitment fees. There was a slight decline by 2% between the FY2020/21 and FY21/22, from UGX.79.1Bn to UGX.77.5Bn. The table below refers;

Table 13: Showing commitment fees Financial year Commitment fees Paid (UGX Bn) Percentage charge











However, UGX.31.6Bn of commitment fee payments was a result of a loan obtained for budget support in the year under review. Relatedly I noted that at the end of the financial year 2021/22, undisbursed loans stood at UGX.15.6Tn. Government’s failure to draw down and low absorption of contracted government debt continue to attract high commitment fees and affect service delivery.

Management explained that the Ministry is aware of the problem of payment of Commitment fees due to delays in signing of Agreements when Sectors and implementers of projects are not ready. Going forward, the Ministry will only sign financing Agreements when sectors are ready to implement the projects to avoid payment of commitment fees. In addition, emphasis is being made on ensuring that feasibility studies are conducted before projects are submitted to parliament.

I advised Government to identify and resolve any bottlenecks hindering the smooth implementation of projects/programmes and activities so as to increase its loan/debt absorption rates.

2.8 CANCELLATION OF THE LOAN FOR CONSTRUCTION OF MUZIZI HYDROPOWER PLANT

In the year 2016, the GoU signed financing agreements with the ADF and KFW to fund the construction of a hydropower plant in Muzizi the project was for the construction of a 45 MW Muzizi hydropower plant in western Uganda with the aim of improving the electricity supply to the growing economy and the households.

In my report of the FY 19/20, I pointed out the challenges of under absorption of funds for this project and in the report for FY 20/21, I further emphasized the losses associated with the failure to absorb the said loan.

In a letter dated 22 nd February 2022, the Minister sought to cancel the loan agreement entered into with KFW, to which KFW acknowledged and agreed to the cancellation of the loan. The table shows the details of the loans;

2.9 REVIEW OF JINJA EXPRESS HIGHWAY PROJECT

Kampala-Jinja Expressway Project Phase 1 agreement was entered into between the GOU and the African Development Bank for a total amount of USD.229.5Mn (equivalent to UGX.0.863Tn). The parties agreed to 0.25% (beginning 60 days after the date of the loan agreement) commitment fee and front end fees of 0.25% (not later than 60 days after the date of entry of the agreement.

The loan was secured to finance Phase 1 of the construction of 77Km Kampala- Jinja expressway project. Development of the first 35Kms from Kampala to Namagunga and the Kampala Southern Bypass is supposed to be completed by 2023.

The following Observations were noted;

- In spite of the availability of the funds, the project had not commenced.

- In the FY 20/21, no funds were drawn from this facility indicating the slowdown of work on the project. It was however noted that a total of USD.0.8Mn (UGX.3Bn) was paid to the lender as commission fees for the undisbursed funds as indicated in the table below;

Table 15: Showing commission fees paid SN Description Amount Exchange Amount (USD) Rate` (UGX.Bn) 1 Front End Fee –Kampala Jinja 573,675 3,570.57 2.1 Expressway Project 2 …003201 Kampala – Jinja 251,982 3,550.43 0.9 Expressway 1 TOTAL 825,657 3

This expenditure constitutes a nugatory expense considering that the funds are paid for no particular gain. The delays in project implementation impact on the economic and social development of the country. Besides the associated commitment fees are wasteful.

Management explained that the project execution has delayed because of protracted procurement processes by UNRA. This matter has been discussed with UNRA during portfolio reviews for ADB funded projects. In future, such scenarios will be addressed through advance procurement processes to ensure that projects are implemented as planned as soon as Financing Agreements are signed.











agreement with option to extend to 30 days before expiry of the date. The parties agreed for an interest rate of 3.7% to be charged on the disbursed amount per annum.

I noted that a total of UGX.67Bn had been drawn by GoU from this facility since it came into effect.

A review of the signed agreement against the Minutes of the National Economy Committee of parliament when approving the loan request by the MoFPED revealed that although the parliament authorized interest to be charged on the loan of 3.6% of the disbursed amount, the final loan agreement however indicated interest of 3.7%. The loan agreement condition on interest therefore contradicted what was approved by Parliament.

The Accounting Officer stated that the Financing for the Meter Gauge Railway Line project is blended financing with tranche2 of Euro 16.9Mn being semi-concessional with a Maturity Period of 20 years, Grace period of 5 years, Interest of 2% p.a, Management Fees of 0.25% and Commitment Fees of 0.25% while Tranche 1 amounting to Euro 9.1Mn is highly concessional with a Maturity Period of 50 years, Grace period of 15 years, interest of 0.055%, Management Fees of 0.1% and Commitment Fees of 0.1% thus the financing was adequately negotiated as per the prevailing time. This is being handled in all current agreements.

I advised Government to be more cautious in the acquisition of loans to ensure the terms of the loan agreement are consistent with parliamentary approvals.

2.11 CONCESSIONAL LOAN AGREEMENT TO FINANCE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE RAILWAYS SYSTEM IN UGANDA

In a resolution of the Parliamentary Committee dated May 2021, the National Economic Committee (NEC) of Parliament approved the following facilities for the Kampala Meter Gauge railway project as shown in the table below;

Table 16: Showing approvals by NEC Lender Amount (UA) Mn Amount (Euro.Mn) African Development Fund 179.6 216.7 African Development Bank 69.9 84.4 Corporate Internationalization Fund of Spain 26 TOTAL 249.5 327.1

Subsequently, the GoU entered into a facility agreement with the Spanish Government for a financial facility of Euro 9,120,100 (equivalent to UGX.36Bn) as a concessional facility to finance the strategic consultant services for capacity building for the railways systems in Uganda. It was agreed by the parties that the drawdown deadline for the facility would be Sixty months from coming into effect of the agreement with an option to extend to 30 days before expiry of the date. The parties agreed on a fixed annual interest rate of 0.055% payable at 6 month intervals on all disbursed funds. The GOU would also be charged a Commission of 0.1% per year applied to all the amounts that have not been withdrawn during drawdown period, and would commence six (6) months after the agreement comes into force.











I noted that in a letter dated 20 th September 2021, Spain communicated that all conditions of the agreement had been met and as such, the loan became effective. In effect, the loan commenced attracting commission for non-withdrawal. I noted that no drawing had been made by the time of the audit in November 2022. There was also no evidence that any payments had been made in form of management commission yet. I further noted that in light of the fact that the loan became effective on 20 th September 2021, the GOU had an obligation to utilize the funds or continue to pay commission fees for the loan and risk a delay or failure of the project.

The delay in withdrawing the said funds by the GOU continues to accrue unnecessary charges of commissions to government. It also has the implication of slowing the progress of the projects.

Management explained that the financing Agreements for the ADF and ADB are now due for signature following the ADB Board Approval on 8 th December 2022.

I advised Government to expedite the outstanding processes to enable utilization of the loan and mitigate further escalation of unnecessary charges in form of commissions.

2.12 FINANCING AGREEMENT FOR SUPPLY OF SOLAR PUMPING SYSTEMS IN THE MINISTRY OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (EURO.95.8Mn equivalent to UGX.381Bn)

A financing agreement between Government of Uganda (GoU) and the Export Credits Guarantee Department of UK (UKEF) was signed on 12 th February 2021 to support the project. The estimated project cost of the project was Euro.100 million. The total loan amount is Euro 95.8Mn (Equivalent to UGX.381Bn) with the GOU counterpart funding the project with 15% of the projected cost.

A commercial Contract, for Design, Supply and Installation of Solar Powered Water Supply and Irrigation Systems was signed between GoU and a contractor on 3 rd July 2020. The contractor commenced works a year later, on 12 th July 2021 after receipt of the advance payment (5% of the GoU counterpart funding). The project is expected to end on 30 th June 2025.

By end of June 2022, the contractor had received Euros.14Mn (14%) of the Contract Sum, while the Consultant had received 27% of the contract Sum (UGX.11.6Bn). The second tranche for counterpart financing supposed to be disbursed in February was postponed to October 2022 due to resource constraints. However, in the same period the third tranche should be released.











fund or into some other public fund which is existing or is created for the purpose of the loan. Section 30(1) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, provides that all revenues or other money raised or received for the purpose of the Government, shall be paid into and shall form part of the Consolidated Fund.

The provision of the financing agreement in allowing an account not resident in Uganda to be construed as a public fund for purposes of receipt of government loan proceeds violates the Constitution and the PFMA. It also seeks to amend the provisions of the said laws.

Management explained that as part of the standard negotiation procedures for all Agreements, the Attorney General is involved from the beginning to the end until Clearance of the Financing Agreement is done. The Ministry has communicated to the Attorney General to advise on whether this constitutes a Public Fund within the provisions of Article 159(3) of the 1995 Constitution and Section 30(1) of the PFMA 2015.

I advised Management to ensure that all provisions of the different financing agreements conform to the existing laws of the country.

2.13 REHABILITATION OF THE TORORO-GULU RAILWAY LINE

The European Union and the Government of Uganda are supporting the development initiative for Northern Uganda through the rehabilitation of Tororo - Gulu railway line that commenced in March 2020 and is expected to be completed on the second half of 2023. In the Grant agreement signed on the 16 th December 2019 between the GOU and the EU, it was resolved that the total cost of the project would be Euros.34.6Mn (GoU Euros.13.1Mn and EU Euros.21.5Mn) respectively.

I reviewed the contract implementation and noted the following;

- Contrary to article 65.1 of the grant agreement, GOU defaulted on their contribution to payment of the contractor. This resulted into termination of the contract by the contractor. By the time of termination, Euros.3.1Mn was due to the contractor. As at 30 th August 2022, only 15.47% works had been completed. Article 65.3 states that in the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the contractor for any loss or damage the contractor may have suffered. The maximum amount shall be 10% of the contract price.

- In a letter dated 24 th June 2022 and referenced UG/T-G-R/SOGETF/FIN/06-22/052, the Contractor, informed GOU of their notice of termination of the contract. This followed the contractor’s notice of suspension of works due to delayed payment. The contractor indicates that by the time of contract termination, the outstanding un-paid amount was totalling to Euros.0.7Mn (Equivalent to UGX.2.5Bn) in respect to the government portion. See details in table below;











Table 17: Details of Certificates paid and unpaid obligations by GOU (amounts in Euros) IPC Submission Invoice Invoice Amount Due date Payment status No. Period Amount proportion Paid 1 Feb.20 - Sep.20 0.4 EU 0.1 0.1 24-Dec 20 Paid GoU 0.3 0.3 Paid 2 Oct.20 – Feb.21 1.1 EU 0.3 0.3 12-Jul 21 Paid Gou 0.8 0.8 Paid 2 nd Dec 2021 3 Mar.21 - Apr.21 0.4 EU 0.1 0.1 23-Sep 21 paid GoU 0.3 0.2

As a result of the termination, the Government of Uganda will incur termination damages up to 10% (Euros.2.15Mn). According to the Monthly progress report No. 34 of August 2022, Termination claim 3 had not yet been submitted by the contractor for final determination and estimation of amounts due. Review of the Treasury Operations financial statements indicated that no contingent liability had been provided for/disclosed in respect to the out-standing claim.

- In addition, I noted that after termination of the contract by the contractor, the contractor never handed over the demolished materials that were supposed to be used for reconstruction of the railway line, besides, evidence from supervising consultant indicated that 136,416 railway items equivalent to Euro 3.08 Mn had been stolen. Similarly, although the Contracting Authority had made 30% advance payment to the contractor amounting to Euro 11.8 Mn by the time of termination of the contract only Euro 2.95Mn had been recovered with the balance Euro 8.85Mn not yet recovered. Delayed reconciliation with the contractor may lead to loss of public resources. The Accounting Officer explained that this is an issue that is being handled following procedures of closure of Contract at Termination. The Final Account shall detail what is payable to the Contractor at the time of termination less what the Contractor owes the Client including losses of Inventory as determined by the inspections mentioned above.











2.14 PLANNING FOR CAPITALISATION OF INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

In the Financial Institutions (revision of minimum capital Requirements) Instrument, 2022, it was provided that for a person to transact in the financial institution business in the capacity of a bank, they should have a minimum paid-up capital of not less than six million currency points (equivalent to UGX.120Bn) by December 2022 invested initially in such liquid assets in Uganda as the central bank may approve.

The instrument further provides that a person proposing to transact a financial institution business in the capacity of a bank shall have a minimum paid-up capital of not less than seven million five hundred thousand currency points (equivalent to UGX.150Bn) by 30 th June 2024 invested initially in such liquid assets in Uganda as the central bank may approve.

I noted that the GoU has interests in four financial institutions as listed in table below;

Table 18: Capitalization requirements SN Financial Institution Reported paid- Requirement 31 Requirement up capital (UGX December 2022 30 June 2024 Bn) (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn) 1 Housing Finance Bank Limited 122. -2 28 2 Tropical Bank Limited 88.2 31.8 61.8 3 Post Bank Limited 98. 22 52 Total 51.8 141.8

I noted that two of the financial institutions require additional funding of capital totaling UGX.51.8Bn by the year ending 31 st December 2022 as indicated in table above. There is therefore a need of additional funding by GoU especially in the case of financial situations in which GoU has majority shareholding. In the case of Post Bank limited, there would be a need for an additional investment of UGX.22Bn to be compliant to operate as a bank as of 31 st December 2022. In the case of M/S Tropical Bank Limited, the GoU will have to liaise with its other shareholder to secure a total of UGX.31.8Bn to be compliant by 31 st December 2022.

In addition, GoU would have to ensure that in the next financial year, it plans for capital injection in all the three banks of a total of UGX.141.8Bn to ensure that the banks are compliant as of 30 th June 2024.

Failure to plan for the capital requirements for the different financial institutions may result in the banks not being compliant and therefore not authorized to operate as banks.











General, and other supplementary information. The other information does not include the financial statements and my auditors’ report thereon.

My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially consistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

Management Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda. The Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.











- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the government’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Reporting Responsibilities











Report on the Audit of Compliance with Legislation

In accordance with Section 19 of the NAA 2008, I have a responsibility to report material findings on the compliance of Government with specific matters in key legislations. I performed procedures primarily to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.

The material findings in respect of the compliance criteria for the applicable subject matters are as follows;

2.15 MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INVESTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT

The Government of Uganda (GoU) is making large investments in Information Technology (IT) systems because of the tremendous benefits that IT can bring to its operations and services. One of the key programmes of NDPIII 2020/21-2024/25 is Digital Transformation, in which Government of Uganda aims to increase Information, Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use of digital services for enhancing social and economic development.

As a result of national prioritization of ICT, I undertook a thematic audit covering three financial years’ expenditure (2019/20 to 2021/22) to scrutinise the management of IT Investments across Government. The overall objective was to assess whether the IT investments in Government are strategically aligned, managed appropriately and focused on achieving the NDP III objective. The procedures undertaken covered: planning and budgeting; procurement, utilization, maintenance and disposal of IT systems; governance, and financial reporting.

I reviewed a sample of 68 MDAs with IT budgets of UGX.968Bn, for the three years in respect of acquisition and implementation of IT systems and equipment of which UGX.894Bn was warranted, as summarised in the table 19 below;

Table 19: Showing budget allocations for IT Systems and Equipment Financial Budget Warrants/Release Variance Year (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn) 2021/2022 331.754 312.233 19.521 2020/2021 357.098 331.691 25.407 2019/2020 279.017 249.989 29.028 967.869 893.913 73.956

	 I reviewed inception reports for sampled MDAs and noted that				
	44 IT projects with a total cost of UGX.34.8Bn, were not				
	implemented within the contractual timelines.				
					
	 38 IT Systems costing UGX.55Bn implemented in 15 MDAs did				
	not meet the user requirements and the users not trained on				
	the usage of the systems.				
					
	 I noted that 29 IT systems acquired by 13 MDAs were not				
	owned by the MDAs, as there was no formal handover of the				
	systems and/ or source codes.				
					
	 37 systems at 14 MDAs that hold data and information that is				
	required and/or used by various MDAs, were found not				
	integrated.				
					
	Non-compliance may lead to duplication of acquisition, procurement				
	of non-compatible solutions and equipment; and general deviation				
	from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service				
	delivery.				
					
I advised the Accounting Officers to develop appropriate policies, strategies and procedures to ensure data availability and integrity preservation in the event that some IT assets are decommissioned. In addition, the Board of Survey recommendations should be adhered to.1.1 Disposal and Decommissioning of ICT Assets15.11.1 of the TIs, 2017, PPDA Act, 2003 (as amended) and PPDA Regulations, 2014 together with the PFMA 2015, require MDAs and LGs to efficiently and transparently dispose assets as recommended.I noted that most MDAs are not disposing off IT assets as per the recommendations of the respective Boards of Survey.disposal of IT assets leads to a further diminution in value and loss to the government. In addition, a lack of appropriate policies may lead to the loss and misuse of critical data. Besides, hazardous materials from ICT equipment may be harmful to the environment.ParagraphHowever,Delayed

1.4. Registration and certification of IT professionals and IT Institutions without enabling regulation

Section 5(i) NITA-U Act 2009, provides for the functions of the Authority to include; regulation of the information technology in Uganda in order to ensure its effective promotion and development. In addition, the Authority is required to act as an authentication centre for information technology training in Uganda in conjunction with the Ministry responsible for Education. However, I noted the following;

- The Authority is currently registering professionals and the training institutions without prescribed regulations and standards. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since 2017; 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while the 11 are expired.

- The Authority has service provider regulations but they lacked timelines for the applicants to get certified. There is a risk that the potential clients to the Authority continue to operate even beyond their valid period. From a sample examined, I











observed that seven (7) companies were providing services to MDAs without certification by NITA-U.

Under the circumstances, the registration and certification without enabling regulations is irregular.

The NITA-U Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs advised that a regulation for IT Professionals would not suffice in governing and/or regulating the IT Profession. They recommended the development of an ICT Professionals Bill which will upon approval, become an Act that guides the regulation and development of the IT Profession just like the other professions (Lawyers, Engineers, Accountants) etc. The development of the IT Professionals Bill is being spearheaded by the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance.

I advised the Accounting Officer to strengthen and align NITA-U in the delivery of its mandate by developing and implementing all the required regulations, laws and standards.

2.16 MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC LAND BACKGROUND

Public land management is the process by which public land is put to good effect. It focuses on establishing and sustaining an optimum balance of use, conservation and development of resources in harmony with the values and needs of society.

Vision 2040 prioritizes Land as a crucial resource for provision of public utilities and calls for sustainable land use and management, as one of the fundamentals to be strengthened in order to harness the country’s abundant opportunities. Whereas Government owns vast land comprising numerous properties used by government agencies to perform their functions in the delivery of services to Citizens, many government entities have had challenges in management of public land. These include; inadequate record keeping, loss of entity control due to encroachment and encumbrances, lack of land titles, uncoordinated and unstandardized approach to acquisition of land for public use, among others.

Subsequent to these challenges and others I have reported upon over time, I undertook a compliance study in 57 selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments (LGs), over a period of four years, to assess whether Government had efficiently and effectively managed public land for better service delivery to the Citizens, and in accordance with the existing Iegal and reporting frameworks. The following were my summary findings and recommendations;











I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that the size, cost and purpose for proposed land acquisitions are included in the respective strategic plans of entities to enable attainment of NDP III objectives and guide effective preparation of annual entity budgets.

2.16.2 Budgeting, funding, and absorption of funds, for land acquisition

Fifteen (15) entities included land acquisition in their annual budgets for the period under review, while four (04) entities acquired land without budgets. The fifteen (15) entities budgeted for acquisition of 17,831 hectares of land at a cost of UGX.483.6Bn; the entities were availed UGX.447.5Bn (93%), and acquired 25,786 hectares at a total cost of UGX.435.3Bn (including a mischarge of UGX.1.74Bn which was not budgeted for land acquisition) leaving a sum of UGX.14.Bn (3% of availed funds) un-utilised.

However, Ministry of Defence which acquired 7,562.07 hectares at a cost of UGX.84.64Bn did not indicate the land size in its budgets. I further noted that four (4) entities acquired 5.06 hectares of land at a total of UGX.20.47Bn without budgeting (both size and amount).

Seven (7) entities received inadequate funding, having budgeted for UGX.333.613Bn and received UGX.297.531Bn (89%)) for land acquisition in the period under review. I further noted that Wakiso and Oyam DLGs diverted a sum of UGX.0.354Bn from funds for land acquisition in the period under review.

I advised the Accounting Officers to;

- Liaise with PS/ST to ensure that funds appropriated for acquisition of land are availed.
- Ensure that availed funds for land acquisition are utilised for the intended purpose.

2.16.3 Compliance of Land Acquisition with the relevant Laws

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, eight (8) entities acquired a total of 3,937.336 hectares at a cost of UGX.79.77Bn directly without competitive participation. The procurement methods used by six (6) entities in the acquisition of 1,666.016 hectares costing UGX.62.83Bn were not approved by their Contracts Committees. I further noted that two (2) entities commenced acquisition of 319.6 hectares of land costing UGX.6.72Bn without confirmation availability of funding. In addition, seven (7) entities acquired 15,760.82 hectares with a value above the UGX200Mn threshold each, at a total cost of UGX.64.76Bn without clearance from the Attorney General.











2.16.4 Involvement of Uganda Land Commission

I noted that out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, five (5) entities acquired 1,669.84 hectares at a cost of UGX.45.9Bn prior to notifying the Uganda Land Commission to enable effective public land management, including advising on availability of other options. I also observed that there was no coordination by the various government entities with ULC in regard to land acquisition.

I advised Government entities to coordinate with ULC when acquiring Public land to ensure that before acquisition, all available options through Uganda Land Commission are exhausted.

2.16.5 Valuation by the Chief Government Valuer

Out of the nineteen (19) entities that acquired land in the period under review, two (2) entities procured 1.96 hectares at a cost of UGX.1.6Bn without obtaining Chief Government Valuer (CGV) valuation. I also noted that the CGV took more than twenty (20) working days in approving consultants’ valuation reports on land government projects contrary to the statutory timelines.

Delayed valuation of Land by the CGV may result into increase in project costs, delayed commencement of infrastructure projects which affects loan absorption rates, and increases commitment charges arising from undisbursed loans from multilateral and bilateral lenders.

I advised the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Lands to ensure that approval of consultant’s valuation reports on government projects are always fast-tracked to avoid project delays and increasing liability to government.

2.16.6 Registration and Titling of Land

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, forty-two (42) entities did not have land titles for a total of 4,398 pieces of land comprising twenty-six (26) entities which had 1,638 pieces of land measuring approximately 80,038.88 hectares and sixteen (16) entities held 2,760 pieces with unknown land sizes. I also noted that seven (7) entities which held 81 pieces of land measuring 12,521.1 hectares had land titles for all the pieces of land held. The anomalies were attributed to the following; inadequate funds to process land titles and land having been donated by individuals who passed on without transferring title to the entity, delays by MZOs to effect registration and transfers, continuous acquisitions of land and delays in the survey process.











and URA explained that Universities were body corporate with a right to own and manage their own land.

I advised the Attorney General to give a general guidance to corporate government entities in regard to the custody of entity land with ULC.

2.16.8 Recording and Reporting of Government Land

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 20 entities did not record a total of 636 pieces of land measuring approximately 19,275.25 hectares in their respective Land registers rendering it difficult to confirm the completeness of their Land inventory. I also noted that 26 entities did not record a total of 1,355 pieces of land measuring approximately 21,603.08 hectares of land in their respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non- produced assets in the financial statements.

The non-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land which could easily lead to loss and /or misstatement of the non-produced asset in the financial statements.

I advised the Accountant General to ensure that the asset module under the GFMIS is functioning properly. In addition, I advised the respective Accounting Officers to update both the fixed asset registers and the asset module under the GFMIS.

2.16.9 Utilization of Government Land for Delivery of Service

I noted that out of the 57 sampled entities, 29 entities did not utilise a total of 258 pieces of land measuring approximately 10,066.8 hectares of land held by 30th June 2022. Non- utilization and use of land for unapproved use defeats the purpose for acquisition which may affect Government’s ability to achieve its intended objectives and deliver services its citizens.

In addition, thirty-four (34) entities had 434 pieces of land encroached upon, of these, 182 pieces measured approximately 61,207.04 hectares. Ninety-six 96 of the 182 pieces of land cost UGX.134.4Bn, while 252 of the 434 pieces had unknown measurements. Land encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the affected land for the intended purposes.











realization of ground rent arrears or development of land as per lease agreement. In addition, Seven (7) entities without mandate to lease out government land granted thirty one (31) leases.

I advised the respective Accounting Officers of ULC, other MDAs and Local Governments to ensure that comprehensive lease registers are maintained for proper management of leased land.

2.16.11 Allocation of Land by District Land Boards (DLB)

I noted that there was no comprehensive database of Public Land by the DLB’s. As a result, two (2) District Land Boards (DLBs) allocated four (4) pieces of land which were not under their jurisdiction.

I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure strict adherence to the internal controls and compliance with land allocation procedures.

2.16.12 Management of Land outside Uganda

The Land Act mandates the ULC to hold and manage any land acquired by the Government abroad, except that the Commission may delegate the management of such land to Uganda’s Missions abroad. I noted that ULC neither had information concerning government land abroad nor delegated management of such land to Uganda’s Missions abroad. There is a risk of mismanagement of government land abroad.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage and liaise with other Government agencies to ensure that the provisions in the law in regard to management of government land abroad are fulfilled.

3.0. REPORT AND OPINION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022

THE RT. HON. SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT Opinion

I have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Local Governments, which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 th June 2022, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, together with other accompanying Consolidated statements for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements of Local Governments for the year ended 30 th June, 2021 are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with Section 52(b) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) and the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018.

Basis for Opinion

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the District Local Government in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995) as amended, the National Audit Act, 2008, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Code of Ethics, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of Financial Statements in Uganda.

I have fulfilled my ethical responsibilities in accordance with the other requirements and the IESBA Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.











Despite my recommendations, payroll management challenges still exist in LGs including lack of consolidated staff list by MoPS, irregularities in payments and deductions, and access to the payroll by ineligible staff, among others.

During the audit of the Financial Year 2021/22, I considered payments and deductions in 130 Districts as a Key Audit Matter. Below are my key findings that are also reported in the individual entity reports.

attributed to release of funds beyond the requirement, and delayed validation of pensioners.Accounting Officers explained that the unspent balances were due to; Delays in recruitment and deployment of secondary school teachers by Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) and Education Service Commission (ESC).  Delays by Ministry of Public Service (MoPS) to approve and clear the recruitment plans.  Absence of fully constituted District Service Commissions (DSCs) caused by delays in approving members by MoPS.  Late release of recruitment and wage funds by MoFPED as most LGs received funds in May, 2022.  Receipt of funds in excess of the supplementary requirement.  Delay in submission of requirements for access to pension and gratuity payroll, and inconsistency in the bio-data between the IPPS and NIRA.My interaction with MoPS revealed that a recruitment calendar was issued to provide for clearance of planned recruitments after the 2 nd Budget Call. This will resolve the issue regarding under absorption resulting from late recruitments.During my interaction with MoFPED, the PSST explained that recruitment plans are contained within the PBS and Accounting Officers have been guided to start the recruitment process after the approval of the budget.The

a) Payment of ineligible personsGovernment has lost a total of UGX.19,026,546,948 due to payment of salaries to ineligible persons/individuals in 129 LGs. The payments contravene section (B - a) (1) & (2) of Uganda public service standing orders, 2021 requiring public officers to be appropriately appointed.reviewed a file of teachers from the Education service Commission (ESC) and noted that 609 secondary school and tertiary institution employees used forged minutes to access government payroll. The individuals had been on the payroll for a varied number of years, ranging from 1 to 39 with some even approaching the retirement. Details are in Appendix 1 b.I brought up the matter to the respective DLGs, the Accounting Officers discontinued salary payments and pledged to take up the matter with police for further investigations.Accounting Officers explained that the issue of ineligible secondary school and tertiary institutions’ employees was beyond them since the appointment and posting is done by MoES. I observed that the inability by the LGs to validate eligibility of the posting instructions was due to lack of aIWhenThe				advised ESC and MoES to automate the database for all teachers, streamline the validation process and consider recruiting teachers to replace those deleted from the payroll.

b) Over payment of salary, pension and gratuity advised the PS MoPS to resolve IPPS system errors and expedite the roll out of HCM. I further advised the PS to ensure that the Accounting Officers undertake effective reconciliations before payments are made.I Section B-a (7) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 requires salaries to be fixed at annual rates and paid in twelve (12) equal instalments. It also requires salaries to be paid correctly, promptly and as a lump sum in accordance with the approved salary structure for the Public Service.Article 254 (1) & (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 as amended provides that a public officer shall, on retirement, receive such pension as is commensurate with his or her rank, salary and length of service. The payment of pension shall be prompt and regular and easily accessible to pensioners.My review of the payroll registers (IPPS) and IFMS payments revealed an over payment of UGX.3,837,170,480 in 75 LGs in respect of 2,085 employees and 270 pensioners/beneficiaries as shown in the table below and details in Appendix 1 c.CategorySalaries Gratuity Pension TotalNumber of staff/pensioners 2,085 208 62 2,355Over payment - UGX2,261,246,384 1,293,882,652 282,041,444 3,837,170,480The Accounting Officers attributed the overpayments to errors in processing of payments for which recovery measures have been instituted.My interaction with MoPS revealed that the Ministry issued Establishment Notices guiding Accounting Officers to reconcile the payrolls before payments are made.

The Accounting Officers attributed the above to: Non-automation of the incremental dates in the IPPS by MoPS for which the Accounting Officers had no control.  Inadequate staff capacity Departments anniversaries/assumption overwhelming numbers.toin monitorthe Human Resource appointment considering thestaff of duty Failure by staff who qualify for salary increments to notify the Human Resource Department.  The slow rollout of Human Capital Management System (HCMS) in all MDALGs.My interaction with MoPS revealed that there is still a challenge in moving staff from one step to another because this comes with extra budget costs which are not provided by MoFPED.									
Payment of deductions (LST, PAYE, UNATU, UCLA)B-a (17) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2021 requires the Accounting Officer to deduct any monies due to Government from an Officer’s salary by way of statutory taxes like and any other authorized deductions. Furthermore, section B-a (18) requires that a public officer’s individual contractual obligations such as hire purchase, loan, and contributions to saving schemes, trade unions and staff associations may be deducted from his or her salary in accordance with the regulations.In addition, section 10.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralized salary processing 2014 required MALGS to pay deductions to the respective beneficiaries and that no arrears in respect to payroll deductions would be accepted.I compared the deductions in the IPPS payroll registers with the remittances/payments in the IFMS details XML payment file and noted an over and under to UGX.5,013,885,697, and UGX.7,697,912,554 respectively as shown in the table below and appendix 1 f.remittance amountingIPPS payroll Deduction amount (UGX)Amount remitted as per IFMS (UGX)VarianceOver remittance (UGX)Under remittance (UGX)1 URA 177,249,202, 488173,280,707 3592 LST 250 5,980,754,39 68,118,380,5 443 UBA/UCL 482 A80,065,479,6 5979,383,042, 5494 OthersTotal3,549,448,15 4 266,844,884, 6973,410,599,9 64 264,192,730 416- 1,501,880,7 13 - 2,583,748,0 85 - 902,686,46 4 - 25,570,435 - 5,013,885,6 975,470,375, 842451,598,8 591,611,519, 228164,418,6 25 7,697,912, 554De duc tion cod e 249Beneficia ryS N3.1.3Section

Non-deduction of PAYE from Political leaders’ and Commissioners’ gratuity3.1.4I advised MoPS to ensure that deduction of PAYE from Political leaders’ and Commissioners’ gratuity automated IPPS.is in19(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act provides that employment income mean any income derived by an employee from any employment and includes the following amounts whether of a revenue or capital nature; any wages, salary, leave pay, payment in lieu of leave, overtime pay, fees, commission, gratuity, bonus or the amount of any travelling, entertainment, utilities, cost of living, housing, and medical or other allowances among others.I noted that in 43 LGs, Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners were paid gratuity of UGX.1,352,773,796 which was not subjected to PAYE computations and deductions on the IPPS leading to a loss of tax revenue of UGX.363,098,974 to government. Details are in Appendix 1 g.In 9 LGs Political Leaders and District Service Commissioners’ gratuity of UGX.439,505,102 was subjected to PAYE manually and UGX.112,440,114 was deducted and remitted to Uganda Revenue Authority. This practice complicates payroll management in LGs and creates inconsistencies where some LGs deduct the PAYE and others don’t. Details are in Appendix 1 g.The Accounting officers explained that computations were not activated in the IPPS to automatically deduct PAYE from Political leaders and commissioners’ Gratuity.My interaction with MoPS revealed that the error arose from the failure to distinguish between untaxable gratuity as per the Pensions Act and other taxable terminal benefits. MoPS has engaged the IPPS developer who required additional funding to rectify the error.Section					
					
					
3.1.5 Inaccurate computation of pension and gratuity					
(L-d) (1) & (2) of the Uganda Public Service Standing Orders, 2021 on the computation of pension and commuted pension gratuity provides that pension is computed on the basis of (1/500)th of the annual salary at the time of retirement, multiplied by the total number of completed months of service using the formula P = LS x Sal/ (500) where P is Pension, LS is the length of Service in months, and Sal is the annual salary on retirement.Paragraph				I advised MoPS to

Additionally, Paragraph (L-d) (3) provides that a public officer has an option to receive all his or her pension as an annuity or to commute a third (1/3) of his or her pension for a 15-year period and receive it as a lump sum at retirement.I recomputed the pension and gratuity benefits and noted that 37 LGs did not accurately compute pension and gratuity benefits for 423 pensioners.

In case of death or early retirement, the process should be initiated immediately the Letters of Administration are issued and/or the early retirement has been granted.5.1.2 of establishment notice no. 3 of 2019 provides that pensioners’ retirement benefits are authorised 5 days after retirement for payment.I however noted that 1,019 new pensioners/beneficiaries in 65 LGs delayed to access pension payroll, with some delays ranging from 50 to 110 months. As a result, UGX.1,380,739,357 was not paid. Details are in Appendix 1 i.Failure to access pension payroll affects pensioners’ livelihood and also leads to accumulation of pension arrears. While non- removal of transferred staff affects the releasing LGs as replacements cannot access the payroll until the transferred staff have been discontinued.The Accounting Officers attributed this to challenges with setting-up pensioners in the IPPS by MoPS because the process is not fully decentralised for which the LGs have no control.

In addition, my interaction with MoPS revealed that with the migration to HCM, the process of payroll payments will be seamless because the HCM will directly interface with the IFMS.13.1 and 13.2 of the guidelines and procedures for decentralised salary payment processing, 2014 requires that the IPPS information tallies with the interface file of the vote. By, the final payroll should be mapped onto the interface to show the same data.I compared the detailed payroll register reports (MoPS) with the interface files from the Core FTP (MoFPED) and noted variances of UGX.28,347,479,053 in 107 LGs.

of the Republic of Uganda represented by the Ministry of Public Service entered into a service agreement with UCLA/UBA on 3 rd January 2020 to manage the loan deductions of civil servants.Uganda Consumer Lenders’ Association/ Uganda Bankers Association (UCLA/UBA) contracted Payroll Consults Africa (PCA) to manage employee deductions on their behalf using the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS).I reviewed employee payroll deductions (non-statutory) and the PDMS records (active deductions report and my approvals) and observed the following; Letters of undertaking or Consent4.2 (b) of the guidelines of managing salary deductions on the Government payroll, 2014 states that as part of the due diligence process, the credit lending institutions and banks will seek for a letter of undertaking from the Accounting Officer/employer or a designated officer confirming that the officer is a bona fide Government employee indicating his or her positions in the MDA/LG, payment details, terms of appointment and other details that may be prescribed by the lending institution.In addition, only deductions consented by employees in writing should be submitted to MoPS (employer) for timely monthly payroll processing or as advised by the employer.I observed that MoPS deducted UGX.20,792,707,030 from 15,002 staff in 44 HLGs on behalf of UCLA/UBA without letters of undertaking or consent as a prerequisite of approval of the deductions.

In the year under review, UGX.4,745,884,699 had been deducted from these employees. Details are in Appendix 1 k.The above end dates are unrealistic and cast doubt on the integrity of the PDMS system controlled by PCA. This has led to continuous deductions from staff and there are possibilities of making deductions from staff without running loans. Unapproved loan deductions by Accounting Officer in the PDMSI II observed that UCLA/UBA deducted UGX.8,885,902,311 from 8,468 staff in 95 LGs without approval of the Accounting Officers from the PDMS contrary to Section 2.1.2 & 2.1.4 of the service agreement. Details are in Appendix 1 k.This creates opportunities to misappropriate funds through making fictitious deductions as well as over deductions.In addition, UGX.1,643,636,038 was deducted by UCLA/UBA from 8,756 staff over and above the approved amounts by the Accounting Officers in 68 LGs.

3.2 Land management in Local Government

The reviews on the country’s performance under the NDP I and II pointed out inadequacies in land management as impediment to effective and efficient service delivery in the country. In NDP III, and in line with Vision 2040, Government has prioritised land management reforms to prevent degradation, adverse effects of climate change and unsustainable land use practices.

As a result, I considered Management of Public Land in a Key Audit Matter because of its importance to the county’s development agenda.

Consequently, I designed audit procedures to ascertain whether the 11 LGs sampled undertake planning for public land acquisition, whether such acquisitions comply with land acquisition and budgeting guidelines and whether the acquired land is registered and titled.

Based on the audit procedures performed, I made the following significant audit findings;

Details are in Appendix 2 a. virements where need arises.

- Only 1 of the 10 pieces measuring 40.47 hectares was planned in the strategic plan.
- 8 of the 10 pieces of which 1 piece measuring 40.47 hectares and 7 pieces of undefined measurements were budgeted for at a cost of UGX.0.627Bn while 2 pieces measuring 2 hectares were not budgeted for.

 Of the budgeted amount of UGX.0.627Bn, UGX.0.624Bn was availed resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.003Bn (0.5%).Of this UGX.0.296Bn was spent on Land acquisition while UGX0.305Bn (49%) was diverted and the unspent difference of UGX.0.024Bn was swept back to the consolidated fund.Inadequate budgeting for land acquisition may lead to mischarges, diversions, interest costs arising from delayed payments and accumulation of Domestic arrears while under absorption and failure to acquire the planned size of land affects the entities abilities to achieve the intended objectives for Land acquisition.

Details are in Appendix 2 d.also noted that 10 entities did not record a total of 603 pieces of land measuring approximately 2234.98 hectares in their respective GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements. Details are in Appendix 2 e.lack of an updated land register was mainly attributed to the absence of a reconciled position between land acquired by the lower local governments and the various departments in the district while the failure to update the GFMIS was attributed to non-functionality of the GFMIS system and valuationnon-recording of land in the land register and GFMIS Asset module affects the Government’s ability to keep track of all its land and could lead to misstatement of the non- produced asset in the statement of financial position and in the summary statement of stores and other assets (physical assets).IIInstructionTheThe			advised Government to ensure that all Land acquired is duly recorded in the entity Land register and GFMIS Asset modules.I

3.3 Inconsistencies in the basis of accounting in Financial Reporting Guide and Treasury Instructions

Instruction 5.2.1 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 states that as a transitional arrangement towards the adoption of the full accrual basis of accounting, all votes (Central Government, district and urban municipalities) shall maintain their books of account on the modified accrual basis of accounting,

Guideline 2.4 of the Financial Reporting Guide, 2018 provides that there are two bases of accounting currently being used by the Government entities (Modified Cash and Accrual Basis of Accounting).

Furthermore, accounting policy 1(e) of the Financial Reporting Template used for Cities and Municipals provides for preparation of financial statements using accrual basis of accounting.

As a result, inconsistencies affect the accuracy of the criteria used by Auditor General to provide opinions on the financial statements.

The Accountant General explained that;

- The Treasury Instructions are clear about the transitional arrangement towards the adoption of the full accrual basis of accounting. However, the natural progression is to move from Cash basis through modified cash and modified accrual and eventually full accrual basis of accounting and the Accountant General revises guidelines from time to time to facilitate this transition. Furthermore, the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the latest guidance provided in the Financial Reporting Template.

- A review of the Financial Reporting Guide and Financial reporting Template is in progress and the above will be harmonised.

The Accountant General was advised to expedite the revision of the Financial Reporting Guidelines and Templates.

3.4 Consolidation of Local Authorities with different accounting bases

- Government is in the process of transiting from modified cash basis of Accounting to Accrual basis of Accounting.











- While the transition is being done, necessary adjustments and disclosures are done in order to comply with the provisions of PFMA 2015 of having Consolidated Financial Statements of Local Government.

These adjustments will cease once all the entities (Municipals and DLGs) comply with the accrual basis of Accounting, which is the ultimate goal.

I advised the Accountant General to consider revising the Treasury Instructions and Financial reporting guideline to include guidance on the consolidation of financial statements prepared on different bases of accounting.

3.5 Management of YLP and UWEP in Local Governments

Youth Livelihood Program (YLP) and Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) commenced in the FYs 2013/14 and 2015/16 respectively with aim of providing affordable credit through an interest-free revolving fund.

I reviewed the progress reports of various LGs data obtained from the MoGLSD as at 30 th June 2022 and noted the following;

- Under YLP the recovery rate was only 23% of the amount due as at 30 th June The table below refers. The best performing DLGs with collections above 60% were Kotido, Kazo and Kyankwazi while the worst LGs were Bugweri DLG, Lamwo DLG, Tororo MC, Amudat DLG and Abim DLG with collections of 5% and below. Appendix 3 a refers.

Other Matter

In addition to the matters raised above, I consider it necessary to communicate the following matters other than those presented or disclosed in the financial statements;

3.6 Implementation of the Approved Budget

Over the years, Local Governments have experienced challenges in the implementation of the approved budget and these have affected service delivery. Previous OAG audit reports on budget performance have also revealed significant weaknesses that have affected the credibility of the LG budgets; these include diversion/mischarge, revenue underperformance, under absorption and implementation of off-budget activities, among others.

Although there has been an improvement in the quantification of activities and the preparation of performance reports, I identified areas that need improvement to make the planning processes better, improve performance, credibility of future budgets and service delivery.

Below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in the individual reports that have been issued separately;

3.6.1 Approval of budgets by Parliament without corresponding strategic plans

Regulation 26(1) of the National Planning Authority (NPA) [development of Plans] Regulations requires entities to submit five-year development plans for certification before approval to ensure that strategic plans are well aligned to the National Development Plans.

By the end of the FY2021/22, only 80 (47%) out of 169 LGs had their strategic plans certified by NPA. By the time of writing this report, NPA had not yet certified strategic plans for 89 (53%) LGs that had submitted, as shown below;

STATUS OF APPROVAL OF STRATEGIC PLANS BY NPA











I noted that Parliament approved budgets for 169 LGs in the FY 2020/21 and 89 LGs in the FY 2021/22 without the corresponding certification of strategic plans by NPA. Details are in appendix 4 a.

As a result, some of the Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AW&Bs) and therefore the activities implemented in the FY 2021/22 may not be consistent with the NDP III, which may hinder the attainment of the development goals, objectives and targets set by the country.

The Accounting Officers attributed the above to delays by NPA to review and give feedback on the strategic plans, compounded by lack of training and technical support from NPA and MoFPED during the development of the strategic plans.

My interaction with the PSST, revealed that the change from sector to programmatic approach led to delayed issuance of the NDP III implementation plan by NPA to LGs thus affecting the preparation and approval of the strategic plans.

I advised NPA to expedite the issuance of NDP III implementation plan and to build capacity of planners in the government entities to minimize delays in the preparation and approval of strategic plans.

3.6.2 Revenue performance

169 LGs budgeted to receive a total of UGX.5,995,310,337,537 but realized only UGX.5,426,900,787,092 (91%), leading to a shortfall of UGX.568,409,550,445 (9%). The performance of each revenue source is summarised in the table below:

Table 24: Local Government revenue performance Revenue Source Approved Budget - Warrants - UGX Variance - UGX %age UGX performance

0 Local Revenue Central Government Transfers received External Assistance grants from other government units

Approved Budget warrants

Generally, LGs are heavily dependent on the central government grants which contribute 98% of the LG total funding.

Local revenue performance, where 148 HLGS did not collect UGX.92,168,883,294 (41%) affected activities for which local revenue funding was earmarked. Details are in appendix 4 a.

The Accounting Officers attributed the shortfall in local revenue collection to the effects of COVID 19 on markets, trading licenses, hotels tax and royalties.

Other than the local revenue source, the LGs had no control over the performance of other revenue sources, which affected the implementation/ payment for the following activities;

- Council allowances and other council activities.
- Funding of some gazetted PDM SACCOs and the recruitment of parish chiefs
- URF road activities under routine mechanised and periodic maintenance.
- Health service activities, including immunisation, treatment of Malaria and Tuberculosis.

- MoLG and Local Government Finance Commission should expedite the roll out of Integrated Revenue Administration System (IRAS) in all LGs to improve revenue assessment, collection and reporting, which will enhance local revenue performance.

- LGs should prepare budgets in consultation with donors to ensure realistic and attainable revenue estimates. LGs should further ensure compliance with donor requirements to avoid penalties and unnecessary delays.

- Adequately sensitize and mobilize communities on tax related matters like compliance and carry out a robust tax payer assessment and enforcement.











3.6.3 Unutilised funds

From the total receipts in the FY of UGX.5,426,900,787,092, only UGX.4,723,235,613,153 (87%) was utilised, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.703,665,173,939 as shown in table below and in appendix 4 b.

Table 25: Unutilised funds in Local Governments No Activity 1 Salary, pension and gratuity payment 2 USMID AF in refugee hosting districts 3 Micro scale irrigation 4 DRDIP funding subprojects 5 USMID construction of roads

Amount-Unspent (UGX) 176,355,014,007 41,830,160,377 28,315,288,149 12,412,158,314 31,425,512,796 6 Others 413,327,040,296 Total 703,665,173,939 Source: LG work plans, budgets and performance reports

The failure to utilise funds led to either partial or non-implementation of the following activities;

- 8,347 staff and pensioners/beneficiaries in 115 LGs were under paid.
- 4 LGs did not implement 25 infrastructure projects under USMID AF.
- In 23 LGs, 190 farmers were not supported with irrigation equipment which exposed a large number of farmers’ plantation to drought.
- 46 subprojects under DRDIP in 2 LGs were not implemented.

The Accounting Officers attributed the failure to absorb the funds as highlighted in the table below;

Table 26: Reasons for under absorption of funds in Local Governments No Activity Explanations from the Accounting Officers 1 Salary, pension and  Late disbursement of funds by MoFPED for recruitment of gratuity payment teachers and health workers.

- Delay by MoES to approve the recruitment plans for secondary school teachers.
- Delays by MoPS to approve staff structures. 2 USMID AF in  Delayed dissemination of the approved project designs and refugee hosting implementation guidelines by the USMID secretariat in districts MoLHUD. 3 Micro scale  Late disbursement of program funds irrigation
- Failure to co-fund. 4 DRDIP funding  Late disbursement of program funds and approval of subprojects subprojects











funds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation, these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line with the Public Finance Management Act 2015.

I noted that 5 LGs received UGX.3,670,739,179 from external development partners for implementing activities not budgeted for. However, these funds were neither declared to PSST nor a supplementary budget issued contrary to Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015.

This therefore implies that the total budgets of these entities was understated, thus distorting planning and, may result in duplication of activities. Details are shown in the table below.

Table 27: Local Government off- budget financing S Vote Code Entity Name Amount - UGX N 1 523 Kayunga District 773,412,069 2 544 Nakasongola District 400,000,000 3 586 Otuke District 342,888,374 4 602 Rubirizi District 350,890,654 5 556 Yumbe District 1,803,548,082 Total 3,670,739,179

The Accounting Officers attributed this to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such off budget receipts and also receipt of funds not expected at the time of planning.

During my interaction with PSST indicated that MoFPED created a window to allow off budget financing to be recognised in PBS. In addition, MoFPED is continuously engaging development partners to fund LGs through the government funding system.

I advised Government to ensure that all funds are included in the PBS and appropriated by Parliament, and expenditure of such funds follows the government financial system. In addition, all funds received outside the approved budget during the year should be disclosed to the PS/ST for supplementary appropriation.

3.6.5 Excess release of wage funds to LGs











Table 28: Excess release of wage funds to Local Governments SN Entity

I also observed that whereas the cities had not operationalised the city staff structures, funds for recruitment were released and therefore remained unutilised at the end of the financial year.

This limits the availability of funds to cater for priority areas and creates an avenue for misappropriation of funds.

The Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to disburse funds lies with MoFPED.

I advised the PSST to ensure that funds are released in accordance with the approved budgets.

3.6.6 Transfer of funds to LLGs by LGs to avoid sweep backs

Section 17(1) of the PFMA 2015 provides that every appropriation by Parliament shall expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made.

Sub Section (2) provides that a vote that does not expend money that was appropriated to the vote for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year, repay the money to the Consolidated Fund. During my audit of the FY 2021/22, I observed that 23 LGs transferred UGX.6,493,901,877 to LLGs towards the end of the financial year to avoid funds remaining unutilised. Details are in appendix 4 b.

This action contradicts Section 17(1) and (2) of the PFMA 2015 and will result into misappropriation of public funds.











3.6.7 Misclassification of expenditure

Instruction 7.10.3 of the Treasury Instructions 2017 stipulates that the chart of accounts provides a basis for a uniform budget classification and execution; therefore, it is mandatory for all votes to use the coding structure to budget and execute the budget.

However, I made the following observations:

- In 43 LGs, UGX.5,461,616,914 relating to pension (212102), pension arrears (321608) and gratuity (213004) was misclassified on code 212102 relating to monthly pension, thus overstating the monthly pension expenditure. Details are in appendix 4 b.

- In some LGs, UGX. 39,524,117,773 was charged on wrong account item codes contrary to those in which they were budgeted for as shown in the table below.

Table 29: Misclassification of expenditure in Local Governments Program Number of HLGs Amount (UGX) Pension and gratuity 43 5,461,616,914 Microscale Irrigation 39 20,478,337,116 Ex-gratia 11 525,038,679 Other expenditure lines 43 13,059,125,064 Total 39,524,117,773

The Accounting Officers attributed that:

- All payments of pension, gratuity and pension arrears are aggregated to one code in the interface file.
- Different program activities were budgeted for under one account code which led to expenditure being charged wrongly contrary to where they were budgeted for. This is a matter that can only be addressed by PSST MoFPED.

I explained to the Accounting Officers that the LGs are likely to deviate from the planned activities without early detection by management. During my interaction with MoFPED it was explained that the PSST will engage MoPS on the aggregation of pension and gratuity matters while misclassifications arising from budgeting on wrong codes, the Accounting Officers will be reminded to appropriately budget for expenditure on the correct codes.











Similarly, Regulation 42 and 43 (2) of the Local Government Financial and Accounting Regulations 2007, require funds to be properly vouched and accounted for within a period of a month.

From the review of documents supporting payments made in the year, it was noted that payments amounting to UGX.2,495,441,197 in 23 LGs remained un-accounted for by close of the financial year as shown in Appendix 4 b.

Consequently, I could not confirm that the funds were utilized for the intended purpose and therefore this implies that the expenditure account balances are overstated by the amount not accounted for.

I advise the Accounting Officer to provide supporting documentation for this expenditure with a view of initiating a recovery process from the officers who hav failed to account.

3.8 Ex-gratia payments

In the 2 nd budget call circular for the financial year 2021/2022, the PS/ST requested HLGs to adequately budget for Ex-gratia and Councillor’s allowance in FY 2021/2022.

I noted that 31 LGs received UGX.4,543,306,404 (72%) out of the approved budget of UGX.6,290,484,980 resulting into a deficit of UGX.1,747,178,576 as shown in the table below.

Consequently, 3,002 Councillors in 36 HLGs were not/under paid by UGX.1,168,823,662 during the financial year under review as shown in appendix 4 c.

This has affected the political oversight role in monitoring the implementation of government programs at a local council level thus affecting service delivery.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to the increase in the number of councillors without a corresponding increase in funding as a result of MoFPED capping the IPF for which the entity has no control. The Accounting Officers further stated that the matter had been presented to MOFPED and MOLG for their action.

I advised MoFPED to provide sufficient funding to cater for the increased number of political leaders due to the creation of new administrative.











As a result, there have been challenges in implementing and monitoring the related service delivery activities. For instance, in the year under review, a sum of UGX.13,628,553,456 was returned to the consolidated fund because of failed implementation.

I further noted that there is always either a delay to re-vote the funds or the funds are not re-voted thus affecting the implementation of service delivery activities.

I have audited the implementation of these programs and a separate report will be issued and this will form part of the report on the consolidated financial statements of Local Government.

Currently, program monitoring is a responsibility of only OPM and yet they are thin on the ground. My interaction with PS MoLG indicated that there is need to establish a strong project coordination unit to effectively monitor and supervise government programs at local government.

I advised the PSST to consider sending the program funds directly to the implementing LGs.

3.10 Implementation of selected service delivery activities

Out of the LG expenditure of UGX.4,723,235,613,153 in the financial year 2021/2022, 49.9% was spent on employee costs which has been reported above as KAM and the balance was utilised in major interventions. I undertook a review of these interventions to assess the extent of service delivery;

1. Parish Development Model
2. Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP)
3. Micro Scale Irrigation Programme
4. Support to organized groups for improvement of people’s livelihood
5. Operationalisation of new cities
6. Uganda Inter-Governmental Fiscal Transfers Reform Program
7. Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program (USMID-AF) Refugee Hosting Districts
8. The Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development in Cities and Municipal Councils
9. Management of Royalties
10. Utilisation of the Discretionary Development Equalisation Grant (DDEG) – LRDP
11. Uganda Road Fund

- Refugee Hosting Districts The Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development in Cities and Municipal Councils Management of Royalties Utilisation of the Discretionary Development Equalisation Grant (DDEG) – LRDP Uganda Road Fund











During the Financial Year 2021/2022 169 LGs had an approved total budget of UGX.175,429,879,581 for PDM activities, out of which, the entities received only UGX.108,857,715,367 (62%), leading to a shortfall of UGX.66,572,164,214 (38%) as shown in the table below.

The programme registered a number of achievements in some LGs including recruitment of Parish Chiefs to carry out the overall administration and management of a Parish unit in Local Government, and registration of SACCOs.

However, despite the above, there have been challenges in the implementation of PDM that indicate lack of Government preparedness in implementing the programme at the Local Government level as illustrated below and in appendix 5 a and b.

3.11.1 Guidance on the utilisation of the PDM funds

Guideline 3.6.4(i) of the Implementation Guidelines for Parish Development Model, 2021 bestows upon the PDM Secretariat the role of ensuring that guidelines and other instruments for operationalizing decentralized services under the PDM are issued before the commencement of the Financial Year. My audit of the program implementation revealed the following;

- During the FY 2021/22 169 LGs received UGX.108,857,715,367 for implementation of PDM activities without guidance on how the funds should be utilised. The guidelines/directives on utilisation of the PDM funds were issued towards the end of the financial year after the funds had been released.

- My interaction with the LG Accounting Officers revealed that when the guidance was issued, they were in many instances contradicting. For instance, while the PDM secretariat guided that funds should go direct to PDM SACCO accounts in commercial banks, the PSST guided that the funds should be sent to the entity general fund account. While the PDM secretariat required that LGs procure gadgets and tools following the PPDA guidelines, PSST guided that funds for gadgets and tools be repurposed to the parish revolving fund.

The lack of clear guidance and conflicting directives affected program implementation thereby causing a number of challenges as listed below;











I advised the PSST to ensure that repurposing of appropriated funds is done within the law.

b) Under funding of PDM SACCOs

Analysis of funds disbursed to SACCOs revealed that 8,703 SACCOs received varying amounts ranging from UGX.2,365,097 to UGX.17,812,103. I also noted that 1,502 SACCOs in 70 LGs did not receive any funding.

The funding variations were due to lack of accurate data on the number of parishes.

This may affect program implementation and attainment of objectives of wealth creation and employment generation at the Parish level.

The Accounting Officers attributed the failure to fund all SACCOs to shortfalls in releases. I advised MoFPED to ensure that baseline data is collected by UBOS to inform the subsequent PDM disbursement and other decisions.

c) Payment of PDM SACCOs before registration

G uidance 16 by the PSST in the letter referenced EDP86/103/02 and dated 25 th May 2022 required Accounting Officers to register PDM SACCOs on IFMS after duly registering them under the Cooperative Societies Act (as amended) and signing a Financing Agreement.

I noted that in 49 LGs, a total of UGX.29,523,564,220 for revolving funds was transferred to 3,214 SACCOs that were neither registered under the Cooperative Societies Act nor had signed Parish Revolving Fund (PRF) Financing Agreements.

This led to funding of ineligible SACCOs which negatively affected the objective of wealth creation and employment generation.

The Accounting Officers explained that this was done to avoid the sweep back of funds to the consolidated account. The Accounting Officers further explained that the process of registering SACCOs was ongoing.











As a result, 5 LGs diverted a total of UGX.358,069,571 from the revolving fund to administrative activities without the PSST’s guidance.

The Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to release funds lies with MoFPED for which they had no control.

I advised the PSST to ensure that funds are channelled directly to the PDM SACCOs in line with the guidance.

e ) Un-utilised funds on SACCO accounts

I noted that a total of UGX.79,214,076,265 revolving funds paid to 8,703 SACCOs in 169 LGs remained idle on the SACCO bank accounts.

Failure to timely utilise disbursed funds delays the achievement of the PDM objectives of improving community livelihoods and will also compromise recovery of the advanced funds.

The Accounting Officers attributed the non-utilisation of the funds to the halting of PDM activities due to insufficient funds to commence the SACCO operations, delays to register SACCOs and lack of guidance on funds utilisation.

I advised the PDM Secretariat and MoFPED to resolve the implementation challenges so that the SACCO operations can commence.

f) Irregularities in recruitment of parish chiefs

These funds were meant for the recruitment and payment of salaries for the Parish Chiefs whose main role is to mobilize, sensitize and create awareness on PDM programs to the community, as well as coordinate and support implementation of PDM activities among others.

I noted irregularities in the recruitment of parish chiefs. For instance, in Butaleja DLG, 15 out of the 39 parish chiefs recruited, had forged academic documents, resulting in loss of government funds worth UGX.12,328,680 which the Accounting Officer had started recovering.











The Accounting Officers attributed the failure to account to the ongoing program activities and delayed submission of accountabilities by the respective staff.

I advised MoLG to ensure that Accounting Officers adequately account for all the PDM funds utilised.

Conclusion

In a bid to address the challenges in the implementation of the PDM, Government through MoFPED should harmonise the issuance of guidelines and ensure all guidelines are issued through the PDM secretariat. Considering that the SACCOs have been funded, the PDM Secretariat should guide on funds utilisation to enable implementation of enterprise activities leading to wealth creation and employment.

3.12 Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP)

Uganda is Africa’s largest refugee hosting country with over 1.5 million refugees and asylum-seekers. This has occasioned social, economic and environmental needs to the host communities and the displaced (refugees and returnees).

In response to these needs, the GoU, through the Office of the Prime Minister, implemented the Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP), aimed at improving access to basic social services, expanding economic opportunities and enhancing environmental management in the 15 districts.

Despite the achievements of the programme, such as increased earnings of vulnerable communities, improved infrastructures and provision of alternative energy sources among others, the overall implementation of the project has been slow with notable challenges.

During the FY 2021/22, 15 LGs received UGX.211,983,309,284 from Central Government to implement various activities under DRDIP. Below are my summary findings, details of which are included in the individual reports that have been issued separately;

Out of the total receipts of UGX.211,983,309,284, only UGX.198,556,306,121 (94%) was spent, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.13,427,003,163 (6%).

As a result of the failure to utilise all funds released, 46 subprojects in the 2 LGs were not funded, which affects the attainment of the program objective of providing support to the poor and vulnerable people in the refugee hosting areas.

The Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to release funds lies with the DRDIP secretariat at OPM.

I advised the PSST to release funds in accordance with the appropriation. 3.12.2 Delayed Implementation of subprojects for the FY 2021/22

I reviewed the DRDIP approved work plans, performance reports and undertook audit inspections to ascertain the status of implementation of the subprojects and compliance with the project guidelines. I made the following observations and the details are in appendix 6 b to d;

a) Infrastructure subprojects

UGX.142,866,878,891 was released by OPM and subsequently disbursed by the respective districts to 192 subprojects for construction, rehabilitation or expansion of basic social services such as education, human health facilities; and economic infrastructure such as roads and market structures. A review of the progress reports and interviews with the DRDIP liaison officer revealed the following;

- 182 subprojects that received UGX.135,411,714,542 in 15 districts had not commenced construction activities for which they were funded by the end of the financial year.

- Only 4 subprojects that received UGX.1,400,664,349 in Arua and Koboko DLGs were ongoing as at the close of the financial year.

- 6 subprojects that received UGX.6,054,500,000 in Kamwenge and Koboko DLGs had fully implemented the planned activities as at the close of the financial year.











b) Livelihoods Program

UGX.29,784,194,334 was released by OPM and subsequently disbursed by 13 districts to 668 subproject groups for small businesses, skills-based jobs, and service enterprises. A review of the progress reports and interviews with the DRDIP liaison officers revealed the following;

- 307 subprojects groups that received UGX.12,847,363,682 in 8 districts had not commenced as at the close of the financial year.

- 149 subprojects groups that received UGX.8,223,780,652 in 5 districts were ongoing as at the close of the financial year.

- 212 subprojects groups that received UGX.8,713,050,000 in Kamwenge, Isingiro and Obongi districts were fully implemented as at the close of the financial year.

The Accounting Officers attributed the delayed implementation of infrastructure subprojects to late release of funds, with most of the funds being received in the last quarter of the financial year.

c) Sustainable environmental management

By the close of the financial year, all the Sustainable Environmental Management activities had not commenced in all the 309 subprojects in 15 DLGs, yet a sum of UGX.19,703,894,013 was released by OPM.

The Accounting Officers attributed it to suspension of activities owing to an investigation by the Inspectorate of Government.

Due to the delayed commencement of the subprojects and suspension of sustainable environment management subprojects, UGX.161,993,299,642 was lying idle on the subprojects’/ subgroups’ bank accounts as at 30 th June 2022. Therefore, the program objective of providing services and support to the vulnerable communities may not be achieved.

I advise MoFPED to timely release funds to enable timely implementation of planned activities leading to attainment of program objectives.











This hinders the implementation of corrective action against negative environmental and social effects of the subprojects.

The Accounting Officers attributed the lack of the environmental and social management plans to the failure by Ministry of Works and Transport to conduct environmental assessment as per the DRDIP guidelines.

I advised Ministry of Works and Transport to expedite the environmental assessment process and produce the environmental and social management plans to inform the environmental mitigation activities.

3.12.4 Inspections of service delivery activities FYs 2019/20 and 2020/21

The FY2021/22 (year under review) activities were largely not implemented. I therefore undertook inspection of subprojects and subgroups funded in the FYs 2019/20 and 2020/21 and observed the following details of which are in appendix f.

- 85 infrastructure and sustainable environment subprojects were completed and were operational while 39 livelihood subgroups were ongoing at the time of audit.

- Of the 85 infrastructure and sustainable environment subprojects, 32 infrastructure subprojects worth UGX.11,447,182,034 had not been put to use by the communities, by the time of inspection. These subprojects included; Morta bridge in Yumbe had no access road, Out-Patients Departments, maternity wards, among others.

- 179 sustainable environment subprojects worth UGX.9,949,108,151 had stalled.

- 70 sustainable environmental management subprojects worth UGX.3,353,875,333 had not commenced due to ongoing investigations by the Inspectorate of Government.

Idle projects undermine the objective of the projects and deprive the community of the intended services/benefits.

Failure to put in use completed infrastructure subprojects, delays in implementation of subprojects and subgroups, and failure to complete the infrastructure subprojects was attributed to none appointment of contract managers. Indeed, I noted that 3 LGs did not appoint contract managers to aid in the implementation of the UGX.21,860,851,866 sub projects.











I advised the OPM and Accounting Officers to ensure that adequate monitoring and supervision of the subprojects and subgroups. The Accounting Officers were further advised to expedite the implementation of all stalled activities.

3.12.5 Idle funds on completed subproject accounts

I reviewed the implementation of infrastructure subprojects funded in the FYs 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21, and noted UGX.2,751,804,956 in 66 subprojects in 3 districts remained unutilised after completion of the planned subproject activities. These funds are lying idle in commercial bank accounts of the respective subprojects.

The Accounting Officers explained that this due to lack of specific guidance from OPM on how to manage the unutilised funds on subproject accounts.

I advised OPM to recover the unutilised funds and going forward, issue guidelines on the utilisation of the unspent funds.

3.12.6 Funding of non-existent subprojects

Three unapproved subprojects were supported with a total of UGX.2,777,500,000 in Lamwo DLG contrary to Section 5.6 of the DRDIP Operation Manual, 2019 requiring approval of all subproject plans/proposals by OPM.

I further inspected the purported subprojects and noted that they were non-existent, as detailed in the table below;

Table 32: Funding of non-existent subprojects SN Name of the subproject Amount (UGX) Audit remark

1. Construction of Community Centre 1,212,000,000  No documents availed in and Fencing at Palabek Gem Zone one Block 1.

support of existence of the project.

- Project does not exist in the DRDIP Management Information System (MIS).
- UGX.800m was recovered from an individual, who had irregularly withdrawn funds from the subproject account between 9 th November, 2021 and 30 th April, 2022. The case was reported at Lamwo Police station SD Ref 11/04/05/2022. Design and construction of Sludge 1,010,000,000  No documents availed in Drying Beds for Management of Feacal Matter plus 1km Access Road for Palabek Refugee settlement in Palabek Ogili Sub County.

2. Design and construction of Sludge 1,010,000,000  No documents availed in Drying Beds for Management of Feacal Matter plus 1km Access Road for Palabek Refugee settlement in Palabek Ogili Sub County.

3. Construction of Dormitory at Paludah S.S.S, 1 block for boys and 1 block for girls and School fencing in Palabek Ogili Sub County.

- Project does not exist in the DRDIP Management Information System (MIS). 555,500,000  No documents availed in support of existence of the project.
- Project does not exist in the DRDIP Management Information System (MIS). 2,777,500,000











Funding of unapproved projects, led to the misappropriation of funds in the Construction of Community Centre and Fencing at Palabek Gem Zone one Block 1 subproject.

The Accounting Officer promised to institute an investigation into the transfer of funds for the design and construction of sludge drying beds at Palabek Refugee settlement in Palabek Ogili Sub County and construction of dormitory at Paludah S.S.S. The Accounting Officer further explained that the funding of the construction of community centre and fencing at Palabek Gem Zone one Block 1 is under investigation by IGG.

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the recovery of funds and consult the Accountant General on where the funds should be remitted.

3.12.7 Procurement irregularities

I noted a number of procurement irregularities in the implementation of DRDIP program which are illustrated below;

- 99 procurements in the districts of Arua, Terego and Obongi worth UGX.4,646,434,329 were not cleared by the subproject Community Project Management Committees and Community Procurement Committees. These procurements were not undertaken by the communities but rather by OPM and therefore the selected contractors were rejected.

- 1 procurement worth UGX.250,000,000 in Yumbe DLG was awarded to a contractor who lacked capacity as required by the procurement selection criteria. Subsequently, the contractor abandoned the works.

The Accounting Officers explained that the procurement of the service providers were undertaken by OPM without the involvement of the communities.

I advised OPM to harmonise the DRDIP guidelines with the procurement laws to guide the process of procuring contractors.

3.13 Implementation of Micro Scale Irrigation Programme

The Government of Uganda is implementing the micro scale irrigation programme in 47 LGs with the aim of supporting smallholder farmers transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture through the provision of irrigation equipment.











3.13.1 Budget allocation of programme expenditure by category

Paragraph 3.1 of the grant, budget and implementation guidelines-Micro Scale Irrigation states that the Micro Scale Irrigation Grant will fund two types of expenditure categories: (i) capital development (micro scale irrigation equipment) (75%) and (ii) complementary services (25%).

I noted, 8 LGs allocated 71% for capital development and 29% for complementary services contrary to the guidelines that require the allocation to be 75% and 25% respectively as shown in the table below and appendix 7 a.

Table 33: Budget allocation of programme expenditure by category Item Revised % Allocation Variance budget - UGX of the total (%) budget Capital Development (micro scale 4,840,551,221 71% (4%) irrigation equipment) (75%)

Complementary services (25%) 1,963,248,498 29% 4% Total 6,803,799,719 100% 0%

Failure to budget according to the set thresholds led to diversion of funds to non- priority activities thus hindering achievement of intended program objectives.

The Accounting Officer explained that the mandate of determine IPFs and release of funds lies with MoFPED for which we have no control.

I advised MoFPED to allocate funds in accordance with the guidelines. 3.13.2 Slow program implementation

I noted that 40 LGs budgeted to receive UGX.50,081,789,451 for micro scale irrigation program, out of which UGX.49,038,618,192 (98%) was warranted resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1,043,171,259 (2%). Out of the total receipts of UGX.49,038,618,192, UGX.20,723,330,043 (42%) was spent resulting into unutilised funds of UGX.28,315,288,149.











I reviewed the status of implementation of the Micro-Scale Irrigation-Development under Production and Marketing and noted slow progress as indicated below and in appendix 7 b and 7 c;

- 10 LGs did not utilise any of the funds warranted for procurement of irrigation equipment of UGX.9,778,756,031. These included; Luuka, Sironko, Kyotera, Tororo, Bududa, Kamuli, Mubende, Manafwa, Kapchorwa and Ntungamo DLGs.

- 23 LGs planned and sensitised 31,487 farmers to educate them on the benefits of irrigation and the importance of co-funding. I also noted that 16 LGs did not plan to sensitise farmers despite allocating funds for procurement irrigation equipment.

- Out of the total of farmers who were sensitised, only 8,781 farmers expressed interest to uptake the irrigation equipment, out of which, only 642 co-funded UGX.2,212,604,768 to receive equipment worth UGX.9,393,753,304.

- 479 farmers who co-funded received irrigation equipment. 190 farmers did not receive irrigation equipment despite paying the co-funding worth UGX.168,172,295.

- 27 farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.680,694,598 without paying co-funding while some farmers received irrigation equipment worth UGX.329,281,703 with partial co-funding. This was contrary to the program guideline and therefore irregular.

The slow implementation exposes the farmers to adverse effects caused by the changes in weather thus affecting the crop yields.

The Accounting Officers attributed the under absorption to program design challenges which include: inefficient training and sensitisation mechanism, high co-funding rates and high cost of the irrigation equipment compared to the market prices.

I advised MAAIF to consider redesigning the program with the view of making the co- funding affordable for small scale farmers.

- The concrete stands to hold the tanks were incomplete and therefore the water tanks that support the irrigation equipment could not be installed.

- The water sources were shallow and therefore the water pump could not pump adequate water need for the gardens.

- The water tank stands were not of the required height to enable adequate flow of water.











- The contractor had delivered under capacity tanks than required 10,000 litre water tanks and therefore underutilising the irrigation equipment.

- The drag hose pipes were not yet been fitted to enable the flow of water to the garden hence making the equipment idle.

The challenges in the functionality of the irrigation equipment were attributed to the failure by LGs to carry out monitoring and supervision of the installation of the equipment supplied to farmers. This was due to inadequate resources to the District Production Departments that undertake the supervision of the irrigation activities.

I advised Government through MAAIF to ensure that Accounting Officers have adequate resources to undertake supervision activities.

3.14 Support to organised groups for improvement of people’s livelihood

Support to Micro Projects is a Government of Uganda programme which is part of the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan 2 (PRDP 2) in Bunyoro, Teso and Luwero- Rwenzori regions. The program aims at enhancing Household Incomes through mobilizing communities for social economic development and peace building to spur economic recovery of the supported communities.

However, previous OAG audits have highlighted challenges in the management and implementation of the grant. These challenges include: lack of accountability, Inadequate monitoring, and exclusion of district technical teams in the appraisal and approval of supported groups among others.

It is against this background that I audited the implementation of Micro Projects to establish whether the funds released to the groups were utilized in accordance with the guidelines.

During the FY 2021/22, 24 LGs received UGX.2,471,262,293 from Central Government to fund Micro Projects.

Below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;











This was attributed to failure by OPM to provide appropriate IPFs based on the number micro projects planned for by the LGs.

The Accounting Officers explained that the Indicative Planning Figures are issued by MoFPED for which they had no control while under absorption was attributed to delay in release of funds by MoFPED.

I advised the MoFPED to timely fund budgets as appropriated by Parliament. B. Delayed disbursement of funds

Guideline 11.2 (e and f) of the Grants to support Household Income Enhancement Projects under Special Programmes, 2020 requires the district to disburse/transfer funds to the respective beneficiary groups/institution and ensure proper and timely accountability of Programme funds released to the beneficiary groups.

I noted that OPM delayed to disburse funds to the 20 LGs. As a result, the LGs also delayed to disburse UGX.836,470,000 to the 168 groups with delays of up to 9 months. Details are in appendix 8 a.

As a result of the delayed disbursement, the activity implementation at the group level had not started thus the program objective of enhancing household incomes was not achieved.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to the delays in execution of the appraisal and verification processes of target groups.

I advise OPM to always provide Indicative planning figures in advance to enable the entities adequately plan for the program.

C. Unaccounted for funds

I noted that in 7 LGs failed to account for UGX.248,510,000 meant to support the implementation of micro projects in community based groups. Details are in appendix 8 a.











Table 35: status of beneficiary databases SN Category Number of LGs Electronic Manual 1 Maintained a data base 19 2 17 2 Did not maintain 5 0 0 Total 24 2 17

I could not rule out the possibility of multiple government funding to groups.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Accountant General had recently introduced a policy of e-registration for all groups which would resolve the current challenge.

I advised the Accountant General to expedite the introduction and rollout of the e- registration for all groups.

E. Funding of groups above the maximum threshold

Guideline 5.6 for Grants to support Household Income Enhancement Projects under Special Programmes issued on September 2020 requires funding to groups of people and progressive individuals to be between 1,000,000/= and 10,000,000/= depending on the nature of the project and group numbers. In some special cases with the express authority of the Political Leadership, the grant may be increased after evaluation of the need.

I noted that 33 groups in 5 LGs were supported beyond the maximum funding threshold resulting into an excess payment of UGX.221,000,000 without authorization from political leadership as required by the grant guidelines. Details are in appendix 8 b.

This limited the number of groups that should have benefited from the grant and contravenes the limits set in the guideline.

The Accounting Officers explained that these groups received funding directly form OPM for which they had no control.

I advised OPM to consider funding groups through the district administration and in accordance with the set thresholds.

- I observed that 2 micro projects in Nakasongola DLG funded with UGX.25,000,000 were non-existent groups.
- I also noted that 18 groups in 10 LGs implemented un-approved activities worth UGX.104,320,000.











This resulted in a diversion of funds and hindered the Government’s objective of enhancing Household Incomes.

The Accounting Officers explained that the funds that were released to the groups were less than the initial IPFs as determined by OPM. This resulted into diversion of funds to undertake affordable enterprise activities on the premise that the funds available were insufficient.

I advised OPM to provide sufficient funding for approved group activities. 3.15 Operationalization of new cities

On 28 th April, 2020, Parliament approved the creation of 15 new cities in Uganda, in line with Article 179 (1) (A) of the Constitution out of which 10 cities were operationalized.

The creation of these Cities brought on board 42 sub-counties, five (5) Town Council and merged 28 Municipality Divisions into 20 new City Divisions to form the ten (10) new Cities.

The creation was meant to attract good quality leaders, facilitate improved delivery of services and meet the expectations of the Citizens.

During the audit of Financial Year 2020/21, a number of challenges were identified including; funding the operations of the new cities, restructuring of the staff establishment following annexation of lower local governments, lack of guidance from the Minister of Local Government on equitable sharing of assets among affected LGs, and transfer of liabilities. During the Financial Year 2021/22, I noted that the challenges have persisted despite my earlier recommendations. In addition, I noted that there are challenges in financial reporting.

During the FY 2021/22, 10 Cities received UGX.427,337,108,536 from Central Government to fund the operations of Cities. Below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately and in appendix 9 of this report;











3.15.2 Revenue sharing

Section 85(1) of the Local Governments Act, CAP 243, (as amended) requires that the City and Municipal Council’s revenue shall be collected by the Division Councils, and a Division Council shall retain 50 percent of all the revenue it collects in its area of jurisdiction and remit 50 percent to the City or Municipal Council.

Paragraph 78 of the Budget Execution Circular (BEC) for the FY 2021/2022, issued by the PS/ST reminded the Cities to utilize 50 percent of the total revenues collected at the centre and the remaining 50 percent to be utilized at the Divisions.

Out of the budgeted local revenue collections of UGX.37,963,421,372, 8 Cities collected UGX.20,061,189,792 out of which UGX.10,030,594,896 was supposed to be remitted to the Divisions. It was however observed that only UGX.9,621,037,504 (96%) was remitted leading to under remittance of UGX.409,557,393 (4%). Under remittance of shared revenue affected implementation of planned activities at the division level.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to funding challenges which forced the cities to utilise the funds at the Headquarters.

I advised MoLG and MoFPED to ensure that the Accounting Officers always comply with the requirement of the Local Governments Act and Guidance of the PS/ST with regards to revenue sharing.

3.15.3 Delayed implementation of the approved City structure

According to the Guidelines for the implementation of the City structures, the Cabinet under minute 21 (CT 2022) approved the recommended mandate, strategic objectives, functions, staff structures and proposed wage requirements for the new Cities.

Guideline 5.6 of these implementation guidelines require City Councils to adopt the customised structure, implement the structure in accordance with the implementation guideline and secure funding for new structure in accordance with Local Government Financial and Accounting Regulations.











3.15.4 Transfer of assets and liabilities

Section 188 of the Local Governments Act CAP 243, (as amended) provides that at the creation of a new Local Government unit, the Minister shall ensure the equitable sharing of property between the original and new Local Governments.

In a letter dated October 21 st 2021, the Attorney General guided all Districts to establish their headquarters outside the Cities’ jurisdiction. The immovable assets will naturally pass on to the Cities while movable assets should equitably be shared between the LGs and the New Cities as the Minister shall advise in accordance with Section 188 of the Local Government Act.

From my review of the financial statements, asset registers, board of survey reports and interview with management, I made the following observations;

a) Lack of guidance on property sharing

I noted that the Minister had not issued guidance on the equitable sharing of movable assets contrary to Section 188 of the Local Governments Act. Consequently, the assets of LGs had neither been transferred nor disclosed in the financial statements of the Cities.

Therefore, the financial statements of the Cities do not reflect the correct financial position at the year end and the assets could be misappropriated during this transitional period.

The Accounting Officers explained that this was a challenge for them in the absence of guidelines from the Minister responsible for Local Government.

My interaction with MoLG revealed that there challenges in developing guidelines and regulations because the earlier guidance and regulations issued by the Minister of Local government where challenged in courts of law and Parliament. MoLG indicated that they were in the process of amending the Local Government Act.

I advised Government through MoLG to expedite the issuance of property sharing guidelines to streamline the management and use of these properties.











c) Non-disclosure of liabilities

I noted that there were liabilities in 5 Cities amounting to UGX.1,763,698,264 resulting from the merger of 75 LLGs. These liabilities were not disclosed in the entities’ financial statements as shown in the table below.

Table 36: Non-disclosure of liabilities SN City Amount (UGX)

1. Jinja 1,320,853,586
2. Mbarara 187,992,208
3. Mbale 75,946,748
4. Soroti 12,300,210
5. Fort portal 166,605,512 Total 1,763,698,264

I further noted that Hoima, Lira, Masaka and Arua cities had not reconciled the position of liabilities as at the close of the financial year due to insufficient information.

Delayed settlement of these obligations will lead to litigation thus a loss to Government through court fines.

The Accounting Officers explained that the liabilities for the Municipal Council were taken over by the Cities and are being settled as and when the funds are made available.

During my interaction with the Accountant General indicated that the Office of the Accountant General is yet to provide guidance on the presentation and disclosure of liabilities.

I advised Government through the MoFPED to ensure that Accounting Officer disclose these arrears in the financial statements and budget for them accordingly.

3.15.5 Implementation Challenges

I noted a number of challenges regarding operationalization of the Cities. These have been summarised in below;

- Failure to fund operations. The cities did not receive any additional grants except for increase in wage to cater for salaries of annexed staff.
- Limited Office space and inadequate Office Equipment.











Conclusion

In the bid to streamline the operationalisation of new cities, there is need for Ministry of Local Government to fast track the amendment of the Local Governments Act.

3.16 Implementation of Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers (UGIFT)

During the Financial years 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 Government released UGX.81,640,150,547 and contracted firms to construction Seed school and Health centres in 43 HLGs.

Over the years the UGIFT program has faced implementation challenges and therefore that projects have either stalled, remained incomplete or have been abandoned raising stake holders’ concerns.

Consequently, during the financial year 2021/2022, I sampled 41 projects in Education and 58 Health in 43 HLGs to assess the extent of project implementation. I made the following observation;

3.16.1 Failure to absorb project funds

I noted that a sample of 39 projects in Education and 51 projects failed to absorb funds availed to them form implementation of activities and as a result a total of UGX.48,596,056,121 remained on projects accounts.

I noted that in 43 HLGs, out of the total receipts of UGX.81,640,150,547, UGX.33,044,094,426 was spent representing absorption level of 40%. I further noted there were delays in procurement processes in 40 HLGs which delayed the commencement of works. Details are in appendix 10 a.

Under absorption of funds limits the implementation of planned activities thus affecting service delivery. The Accounting Officer explained that there was delayed procurement of the contractors as well as delayed release of funds.

I advised the Accounting Officer to address the bottle necks that impede on the implementation of activities to avoid funds being swept back.











The Accounting Officers attributed delayed completion of works to weaknesses in contract supervision, limited capacity of contractors in terms of equipment, finance and human resources as well as the effects of Covid-19 restrictions that curtailed mobilisation of equipment, materials and manpower. I informed the Accounting Officer that the matter will be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.

3.16.3 Payments to UPDF Engineers Brigade for Construction Works

The MoH and MoLG signed a MoU on 5 th November, 2021 with the Ministry of Defence & Veterans Affairs (MoDVA) to undertake construction of Health facilities using the UPDF Engineers Brigade.

To operationalise the arrangement, the LGs were also required to sign implementation agreements/MoUs with the Engineers Brigade, in which;

- The LGs were to advance 30% funds for the total project cost to the Engineers Brigade.
- Payments to the Engineers Brigade should be supported by certification of previous works by the LG and requisitions for subsequent works done as agreed in the drawings, price schedule and BoQs.
- The Engineers Brigade submits a Project Implementation Schedule to Project Management Teams of the LGs prior to commencement of works, to enable progress monitoring.

During my audit, I noted the following; a) Funds advanced

88 projects in the LGs worth UGX.14,901,441,747 were awarded to the Engineers Brigade, of which UGX.12,168,409,694 (82%) had been advanced by year end, contrary to the requirement of advancing 30% of the contract sum. The Accounting Officers attributed it to the guidance by the PS MoH to release all funds meant for the construction of UgIFT projects to avoid funds being returned to the consolidated fund.

By the time of writing this report (December 2022) only UGX.6,819,552,726 (56%) had been released by the Brigade for project implementation with a balance of UGX.5,348,856,968 remaining unutilised.











My inspection of 81 (92%) projects worth UGX14,744,224,567 revealed that works were still ongoing, while 7 projects in Namutumba DLG worth UGX.157,217,180 had not commenced because land had not been handed over to the Engineers Brigade.

Accounting Officers attributed the delayed commencement of construction works to lack of capacity by the Engineers Brigade to implement all LG projects.

I advise Government to ensure that in future timely instructions are communicated to LGs to enable implementation of Government projects. Meanwhile the stalled projects should be started and expedited.

3.16.4 Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program (USMID-AF) – Refugee Hosting Districts

The Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development Program (USMID-AF) is a 5 year program being implemented by the Government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MoLHUD), with the aim of enhancing service delivery through improved local infrastructure in 11 Local Governments (LGs) hosting refugees effective Financial Year 2018/2019.

With the Financial Year 2021/22 being its fourth year of implementation, there has been a notable delay in the commencement of the infrastructure projects in the beneficiary Districts.

During the FY2021/22, MoLHUD transferred UGX.50,119,497,453 to the 11 implementing LGs. I audited the implementation of the program to establish the status of implementation and below is a summary of my findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;

A. Funding and Absorption

I reviewed the approved USMID-AF budget allocation for the Financial Year 2021/2022 and noted that 11 entities had approved total budgets of UGX.54,254,412,669, out of which, only UGX.50,119,497,453 (92%) was received, leading to a shortfall of UGX.4,134,915,216 (8%) as shown in the table below and Appendix 11 a.











In addition, out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.50,119,497,453, only UGX.8,195,395,478 (16%) was utilised by the 11 HLGs resulting in an unutilised balance of UGX.41,924,101,975 (84%). Consequently, 31 funded projects were not implemented while 22 funded projects were partially implemented.

The Accounting Officers attributed the shortfalls to the fact that the funds are released at the discretion of the USMID-AF secretariat at MoLHUD. The Accounting Officers also attributed the under absorption of funds to the delayed procurement processes owing to the delayed dissemination of approved project designs by the USMID-AF Secretariat at the MoLHUD.

I advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that returned funds are revoted for the implementation of planned activities by the Accounting Officers.

B. Delayed Implementation of Infrastructure Investments

I reviewed the USMID-AF approved work plans, performance reports and carried out physical inspections to ascertain the status of implementation of the funded projects and made the following observations;

- During F/Y 2020/2021, 8 Districts did not implement 46 infrastructure projects funded at a total of UGX.60,611,012,948 Appendix 11 b refers.

- During F/Y 2021/22, 7 Districts partially implemented 22 infrastructure projects funded at a total of UGX.26,126,296,470. Appendix 11 b refers. Further, 4 Districts did not implement 25 infrastructure projects despite receiving funding totalling UGX.21,387,083,470. Appendix 11 b refers.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to the delay by the USMID-AF Secretariat/ MoLHUD to avail the districts with approved infrastructure project designs and implementation guidelines.

The unspent balances were returned to the Consolidated Fund and thus the program objective of ensuring enhanced service delivery through improved local infrastructure was not achieved. I advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that infrastructure project designs and implementation guidelines are issued to Accounting Officers timely to ensure the implementation of planned activities. I further advised the MoLHUD to ensure that returned funds are revoted for the implementation of planned activities by the Accounting Officers.











Failure to directly link planned activities to the program may lead to diversion of funds to unplanned activities thus affecting the achievement of the intended program objectives.

The Accounting Officers attributed the anomaly to the guidance received from the Ministry to plan for the USMID-AF activities under Central Government Transfers.

I advised the MoFPED and MoLHUD to instruct Accounting Officers to ensure that USMID-AF funded activities are directly linked to the program and thus identifiable in the district budget.

D. Failure to maintain separate bank accounts for USMID-AF program funds

Article 4 (e) of the Program Participating Agreement requires the Accounting Officer to ensure that a separate Program Bank Account is opened through which program funds are managed. Article 4 (p) of the Program Participating Agreement requires the Accounting Officer to ensure that proceeds of the grant and any interest earned are used exclusively to fund eligible program activities.

I noted that the beneficiary LGs did not maintain separate bank accounts for the USMID-AF program funds, contrary to Article 4 (e) of the Program Participating Agreement.

The Accounting Officers explained that the funds were managed through the districts’ TSA accounts held in Bank of Uganda in accordance with Section 24.6 of the Treasury Instructions. Failure to maintain a separate bank account for USMID-AF resulted in failure to earn interest revenue from unutilised program funds. Failure to maintain a separate bank account may also result in comingling of funds hence exposing them to diversion.

I advised the Government through MoFPED and MoLHUD to harmonise the requirement for opening a separate bank account and where necessary, ensure that the Accounting Officers open and maintain separate bank accounts for USMID-AF funds in accordance with the program agreement.











3.17.1 Funding and absorption of funds

I reviewed the approved USMID allocation for the Financial Year 2021/2022 and noted that 11 Municipal Councils received UGX.156,321,511,324 as budgeted representing 100% revenue performance.

Out of the total receipts of UGX.156,321,511,324, only UGX.124,895,998,528 (80%) was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.31,425,512,796 (20%) as shown in the table below.

Table 38: Funding and absorption of USMID Year 2021/22 Description Approved Budget Release (B) (UGX) Expenditure Unspent % (A) (UGX) (C) (UGX) (B-C) (UGX) absorption Developm 156,321,511,324 156,321,511,324 124,895,998,528 31,425,512,796 80 ent grant

Under absorption of released funds resulted in non-implementation of planned activities. For example, 8 infrastructure projects worth UGX.12,832,857,565 in Hoima City were not completed.

The Accounting Officers attributed this to delayed procurement of contractors by Ministry of lands, Housing and Urban Development as well as delays in design review by the contractor.

I advised Government through the MoLHUD to ensure that in future, contractual designs are planned early to avoid delays. In the meantime, the Ministry should ensure that Accounting Officers rollover the unimplemented activities to the subsequent period.

3.17.2 Unreleased previous year committed funds

Section 17(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 stipulates that every appropriation by Parliament shall expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made. Furthermore, Section 17 (2) of the same Act stipulates that "A vote that does not expend money that was appropriated to the vote for the financial year shall at the close of the financial year repay the money to the Consolidated Fund."

Consequently, the activities for the current year were affected.

The Accounting Officers explained that the mandate to re-vote funds lies with MoFPED for which they do not have control.

I advised the MoFPED to ensure that the unutilised funds are re-voted to the Cities and Municipal councils for implementation of planned activities.

3.18 Management of Royalties

Below are the brief highlights of my findings, from the audit of management of Royalties in Busia District Local Government, the details of which are in my report to Parliament for the financial year ended 30 th June 2022.

3.18.1 Lack of data regarding the volume and value of minerals mined

Section 98(1) of the mining Act, 2003 states that subject to section 100 of the Act, all minerals obtained or mined in the course of prospecting, exploration, mining or mineral beneficiation operations shall be subject to the payment of royalties on the gross value of the minerals based on the prevailing market price of the minerals at such rates as shall be prescribed.

I noted that the District lacked records regarding the volume and value of minerals mined by the various mining parties (Companies, individuals and Associations) in the District.

The District was also unable to access data on periodic returns to MEMD regarding volume and value of minerals mined by the companies, either from MEMD or mining parties.











for dispute resolutions etc. It communicates the mutually accepted objectives and expectations of all the parties involved.

I however noted that there was no MoU between the District and MEMD which ought to operationalize the relationship regarding mining activities, monitoring, inspection of mining sites, sharing of information and records.

This renders the District a dormant stakeholder in the mining process and as a result, the Local Government is only at the receiving end of royalties determined by other parties. In this kind of arrangement, the District’s interests tend to be suppressed by the other stakeholders.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD with a view of redefining the relationship in the mining industry and having a MoU clearly spelling out the rights and obligations of each party.

3.18.3 Failure by mining companies to submit monthly returns to MEMD

Regulation 53 of the Mining Regulation 2004 “Monthly returns to be furnished” provides that Every holder of an exploration or retention licence shall, as soon as circumstances permit and in any case not later than fourteen days after the end of each quarter, lodge in triplicate at the nearest office of the Commissioner, statements in English in Form XXVI in the First Schedule to these Regulations; and in the case of the holder of a prospecting or location licence or a mining lease such statements shall be provided to the Commissioner in Forms XXV and XXVII in the First Schedule to these Regulations not later than fourteen days after the month reported on.

However, I reviewed the declarations made by the mining companies on the cadastre interface at the MEMD and noted that, a number of these companies failed to submit/lodge monthly returns to the MEMD.

This encourages under or non-declaration of revenue by the mining companies, which affects the royalties thereof.

The above is attributed to deliberate non-compliance by the companies to the regulation and failure by MEMD to enforce compliance.











This encourages under-declaration of the volume and value of minerals mined by the mining parties.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD to consider emphasising verification of mineral returns to ensure that the Central government, District and land owners receive rightful revenue share from royalties declared and paid by the mining parties.

3.18.5 Non-participation of the CAO in licencing and lease approval process

Regulations 11, 19, 23 and 38 of the Mining Regulations 2004 provide guidance in the application for exploration, retention, location licences and mining lease, stating that applications for such mineral rights shall be logged with the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the district concerned within thirty days of erection of a location beacon for forwarding to the Commissioner. In addition, Regulation 8 stipulates the procedure on receipt of application for mineral right by the Chief Administrative Officer.

However, I noted that the CAO does not participate in the receiving and forwarding of the applications for mineral rights to the Commissioner, MEMD.

This has contributed to disconnect in collaboration between the mining parties (companies, associations and individuals) and the District, thus affecting the sharing of information between the parties.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MEMD and establish a mechanism of active participation in the licencing and lease approval processes.

3.19 Luwero-Rwenzori Development Program (LRDP)

LRDP is Discretionary Development Equalization Grant (DDEG) that seeks to enable communities enhance their household incomes. The program was rolled out in 39 LGs in the Luwero-Rwenzori Triangle and is one of the fiscal reforms implemented by Government to improve service delivery. LRDP accounts for 5% of the entire DDEG funds allocated to these Districts in the financial year 2021/2022.

However, previous OAG audits have highlighted challenges in the management and implementation of the LRDP grant. These challenges include: application of LRDP funds to ineligible expenditures and activities, under remittances of funds, late release of funds, under absorption of LRDP funds, diversion of funds.











findings, details of which are included in individual reports that have been issued separately;

3.19.1 Allocation of funds among program activities

Paragraph 1.4 Table 5 (as hereunder) of the DDEG guidelines 2021/2022 provides the maximum thresholds for which a District can use to implement a wide range of infrastructure within their mandate and according to their local priorities and needs.

Table 40: allocation of funds among program activities Main Expenditure Items Threshold Infrastructure Projects, including Physical Planning and land titling Minimum 80% Investment Servicing and Monitoring Maximum 10% Performance Improvement Maximum 10%

I observed that 7 LGs did not allocate funds in accordance with the required thresholds. For instance, in 7 LGs, infrastructure projects funds were allocated below minimum requirement of 80% whereas the investment servicing and performance improvement were allocated above the maximum of 10% as indicated in the table below and in appendix 13 a.

Table 41: Allocation of investment thresholds No. Main Expenditure items Threshold Allocation Amount - UGX 1 Infrastructure Projects, including Minimum 80% 70% 1,871,695,608 Physical Planning and land titling 2 Performance Improvement Maximum 10% 13% 299,789,983 3 Investment Servicing and Maximum 10% 17% 483,628,600 Monitoring TOTAL 2,655,114,191

The diversion of funds hindered the achievement of intended outcomes of the grant of equalizing development of LGs and therefore affecting equitable distribution of resources and delivery of services.

The Accounting Officers explained that the allocation of Indicative Planning Figures (IPFs) is a mandate of MoFPED for which the LGs do not have control.











Table 42: Funding and absorption SN Cost centre Approved Amount % Expenditur Amount not % Budget - UGX Released - UGX fundin e - UGX absorbed - Absorpti g UGX on 1 Infrastructure 8,164,927,374 8,153,926,373 100% 7,682,602,7 471,323,669 94% Projects, including 04 Physical Planning and land titling 2 Performance 843,710,153 843,710,153 100% 853,914,340 -10,204,187 101% Improvement 3 Investment 1,111,423,280 1,075,179,930 97% 1,063,687,3 11,492,592 99% Servicing and 38 Monitoring 4 Transfer of LRDP 15,506,893,697 15,504,103,696 100% 15,514,093, -9,990,000 100% funds to LLGs 696 TOTAL 25,626,954,504 25,576,920,152 100% 25,114,298, 462,622,074 98% 078

I observed that Investment servicing and monitoring was the most affected where LGs did not receive UGX.50,034,352.

I further noted that out of UGX.25,576,920,152 released by MoFPED, 6 LGs failed to absorb UGX.462,622,074.

The Accounting Officers explained that the Indicative Planning Figures are issued by MoFPED for which they had no control while under absorption was attributed to delayed completion of the infrastructure projects by the contractors and bottlenecks in the procurement process.

I advised MoFPED to ensure that budget is funded in accordance with appropriation by Parliament while the MoLG was advised to ensure Accounting Officers adequately manage program implementation to eliminate unnecessary delays.

3.19.3 Implementation of LRDP activities

From the review of the status of implementation of infrastructure projects, performance improvement activities and investment servicing activities, I observed the following, details of which are in appendix in 13 b.

- 18 LGs planned to undertake 109 activities under infrastructure projects. However, only 100 activities were implemented while 9 activities worth UGX.521,220,854 were not implemented.

- 18 LGs planned to undertake 70 activities under performance improvement activities and all these activities were implemented. I also noted that 1 activity implemented worth UGX.3,000,000 was not eligible.

- 18 LGs planned to undertake 53 activities under investment servicing and all these activities were implemented.











I advised MoLG to ensure that Accounting Officers manage program implementation to eliminate unnecessary delays in the procurements.

3.19.4 Transfer to LLGs

Paragraph 1.3.2 of the guidelines provides the rationale for specific rule for sharing of the grant among levels of Local Government. Accordingly, the District is required to transfer 65% of the LRDP funds to LLGs and only retain 35%.

I observed that 16 LGs transferred less funds to the LLGs than the 65% required by UGX.1,144,383,168 as indicated in the table below;

Table 43: Transfer to LLGs Total releases Expected transfer to Actual transfers to Variance (UGX) received (UGX) LLGs 65% (UGX) LLGs (UGX) 25,576,920,152 16,624,998,099 15,480,614,931 1,144,383,168

This affected the implementation of service delivery programs at the Lower Local Governments.

The Accounting Officers explained that the allocation of discretionary transfers is a mandate of MoFPED for which they only transfer to LLGs what has been pre- determined and released.

I advised MoLG and MoFPED to harmonise the guidelines and the determination of the IPFs.

3.20 Implementation of Uganda Road Fund (URF) 3.20.1 Funding

I noted that 96 LGs budgeted to receive UGX.51,950,654,755 to cater for District/City/Municipal Council roads activities using road gangs and the force account mechanism. However, UGX.32,552,444,851 was received from Uganda Road Fund. Details are in appendix 14 a. The failure to fully fund the road activities hindered access to service delivery centres like Schools, Hospitals and Markets.











Table 44: Status of implementation of road activities Category Planned Planned Actual Actual Length Annual length Expenditure - (KM) Expenditure - (KM) UGX UGX Routine Manual Maintenance 16,067 8,494,132,458 7,385 4,089,157,242 Routine Mechanized 6,720 15,394,408,459 4,924 10,306,553,352 Maintenance Periodic Maintenance 845 8,675,569,761 378 4,376,557,279 Total distance 23,632 32,564,110,678 12,687 18,772,267,873 Source: URF work plan and quarterly performance reports

According to my inspection carried and progressive performance reports, I have observed the following;

- 89 LGs planned to maintain 16,067 km under routine manual maintenance at a cost of UGX. 8,494,132,458, however only 7,385 km (46%) were maintained at cost UGX.4,089,157,242 (48%).

- 90 LGs planned to maintain 6,720 km under routine mechanised maintenance at a cost of UGX.15,394,408,459, however only 4,924 km (73%) were maintained at cost UGX.10,306,553,352 (67%).

- 45 LGs planned to maintain 845 km under periodic maintenance at a cost of UGX.8,675,569,761, however only 378 km (45%) were maintained at cost UGX. 4,376,557,279 (50%).

- 88 LGs did not budget for routine manual, routine mechanise and periodic maintenance of roads despite the destruction of a number of roads by the rainy seasons. There is a risk that the roads will further deteriorate given the meagre resources. Access to service delivery centres like Schools, Hospitals and Markets is hindered.

The Accounting Officer attributed this to late release of funds and inadequate and unmaintained road construction equipment.

I advised the MoFPED timely release appropriated funds for the implementation of planned road activities.











material misstatement of this other information; I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Under Article 164 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 (as amended) and Section 45 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 (as amended), the Accounting Officers are accountable to Parliament for the funds and resources of the Government of Uganda.

The Accountant General is appointed as the Accounting Officer and Receiver of Revenue for the Consolidated Fund. The Accountant General is therefore responsible for the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements of Local Governments in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act 2015, and the Financial Reporting Guide 2018, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Accountant General is responsible for assessing the Local Government’s ability to continue delivering its mandate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to affecting the delivery of the mandate of the Government of Uganda, and using the Financial Reporting Guide 2018 unless the Accountant General has a realistic alternative to the contrary.

The Accountant General is responsible for overseeing the Government’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements of local government as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISSAIs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the local government’s internal control.











- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the government’s ability to deliver its mandate. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the government to fail to deliver its mandate.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair presentation.

I communicate with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

I also provide the Accounting Officer with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with him/her all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Accounting Officer, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other Reporting Responsibilities

In accordance with Section 19(1) of the National Audit Act, 2008, I report to you, based on my work described on the audit of the Local Government Consolidated Financial Statements that; except for the matters raised in the compliance with legislation section below, and whose effect has been considered in forming my opinion on the Local Government consolidated financial statements, the activities, financial transactions and information reflected in the consolidated financial statements that have come to my notice during the audit, are in all material respects, in compliance with the authorities which govern them.











3.21 Transfer of Accounting Officers in Local Governments

Section 45(5) shall be responsible and personally accountable to parliament for the activities of a Vote.

Section 43 (3) requires an Accounting Officer to enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a financial year.

During the audit, I noted that the MoLG made frequent transfers of Accounting Officers from one LG to another. In the case of the LGs of Bulisa DLG, Hoima DLG and Fort Portal City, Amuria DLG, Mityana DLG, Butebo DLG, Kabarole DLG and Kitagwenda DLG, two to four Accounting Officers were posted within the same financial year.

The above disrupts implementation of activities thus affecting service delivery and accounting for funds which may in the long run hinder attainment of strategic objectives in the affected LGs. In some cases, it was noted that the Technical Planning Committee (TPC) structures are not fully constituted to lead implementation of the budgets without continuity of service and guidance by the Chief Administrative Officer.

The Accounting Officers explained that it was the mandate of MoFPED and MoLG to appoint and transfer Accounting Officers respectively.

During my interaction with MoLG, the PS acknowledged the effect of the anomaly on service delivery and stated that the challenge can be solved by strengthening the administrative structure by recruiting substantive heads of departments. The PSST also acknowledged the observation and promised to engage the MoLG on the matter.

I advised the MoLG to streamline the transfer of LG Accounting Officers to ensure continuity in service delivery with minor interruptions. The ministry should also liaise with MoPS and MoFPED to provide guidance and funding to strengthen the Technical Planning Committees (TPCs) for all LGs.

3.22 Risk management in LGs











the preparation and application of the risk mitigation plans in the financial year 2022/23. The tools that have been developed are being inbuilt in the draft GOU National Enterprise Risk Management Guidelines.

I advised MoFPED to disseminate guidelines on risk management to all Accounting Officers and ensure that they put in place a detailed risk register and an officer responsible for risk management to minimise the entity’s exposure to risks that may affect the implementation of planned activities.

30 th December, 2022











4.0. REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL ON THE CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 TH JUNE 2022

4.1. Review of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises

According to Section 3 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended); “A Public Corporation means an authority established by an Act of Parliament other than a local Government which receives a contribution from public funds, and any public body which in a financial year receives any income from public funds”. Similarly, “A State Enterprise means a body established under any Act other than the Company’s Act or a local Government council, and a company registered under the company’s Act in which the Government or a state enterprise has controlling interest”.

In line with the PFMA, 2015, I reviewed the Consolidated Summary Statement of the Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises for the year ended 30 th June 2022, and noted the following;

a) Completeness of the Consolidated Summary Statement of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises

Section 52 (1c) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), 2015 requires the Accountant General, within three months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Minister responsible for Finance and the Auditor General the consolidated summary statement of the financial performance of Public Corporations, State Enterprises and Companies where Government has controlling interest.

Furthermore, Section 51(2) of PFMA, 2015 provides that, the Accounting Officer of a public corporation shall, within two months after the end of each financial year, using the format prescribed by the Accountant General, prepare and submit to the Accountant General, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury.

9. Kampala Industrial and business park Ltd
10. Science and Technology Equipment Production (unit) Ltd
11. UGMA Engineering Corporation Limited
12. Housing Finance Investments

In absence of the summary performance of the above mentioned corporations, the consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporations and state enterprises does not reflect the accurate status of government ownership and interest.

In addition, I noted that Government does not maintain a comprehensive database of Public Corporations and State Enterprises to enable independent verification of the number of entities consolidated in the summary statement.

In the absence of a comprehensive database, I was not able to ascertain the completeness of the submitted consolidated summary statement of financial performance of public corporation and state enterprises.

I advised the Accountant General to establish a comprehensive database for all Public Corporations and State Enterprises which should profile entities by capturing information, such as; Name of entity, Business/Industry, Location, Shareholding, Share Capital, Directors, E-mail addresses, among others, to enable the conduct of an independent verification.

4.2 Review of Financial Performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises

The Government of Uganda (GoU) owns shares in a number of Public Corporations and State Enterprises. These enterprises, which are independently managed, are supposed to operate efficiently, make profits and pay dividends to Government. Their financial performance is therefore of interest to Government.

As noted in my previous reports, the Government Consolidated Summary Statement of financial performance of public corporations and State enterprises only reports on; government shareholding, total income, total expenditure, dividends declared, retained earnings, and net worth of entities. However, key performance assessment parameters, such as; profitability, return on assets, liquidity assessment, and debt analysis are not reported on. As a result, I computed these ratios using audited financial statements for further analysis of performance of Public Corporations and State Enterprises.

I assessed a total of 22 entities out of the 50 Public Corporations and State Enterprises. From the financial performance analysis undertaken, I noted the following;

a) Profitability of Enterprises

I analysed profitability of 18 public corporations and state enterprises and noted that only ten (10) made profits/surplus in the year under review, with Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), Uganda Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL) and NEC Luwero Industries Limited posting profits of UGX.37.7Bn, UGX.27.9Bn and UGX.7.9Bn, respectively. I further noted that Mandela National Stadium registered a surplus of UGX.78.8Bn from UGX.1Bn posted in the previous year on account of government support of UGX.80Bn received during the year. Table below refers.

In comparison with the previous year, a number of state enterprises and corporations including; UNOC, UEDCL, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC) recorded significant reductions in losses from the previous year, while entities including NEC Luwero Industries Limited and NEC Farm Katonga Limited registered improved profit positions of over 100% from the previous year. This was mainly attributed to the recovery of the related industries from the negative effects of COVID-19.











affect the entities’ ability to meet future obligations or investments. The table below refers.

Management explained that to realize the annual budgeted revenue, UACC has put in place a number of strategies in order to become a profitable corporation. Such strategies include; having a serviceable fleet, strengthening partnerships/alliances with other operators in the industry, re-engaging former business contacts such as PAE, UN, Red Cross and Government of Uganda.

Similarly, I assessed the profitability of the 4 financial institutions and noted that all the 4 institutions were profitable for the 2 consecutive years. However, the profitability of Pride Microfinance declined by 7% from the previous year. The details are shown in the table below;











I advised the entities to develop clear strategies to improve operations and adopt efficient financial management practices to lower operating costs and increase revenue generation. Government should also consider recapitalizing the most affected entities to revamp their operations.

b) Return on Assets

The Return on Assets (ROA) shows the percentage of how a company’s assets are generating revenue. It measures management’s efficiency in using the enterprise’s assets to generate earnings. Although companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets, ROAs below 5% are generally considered inadequate.

I assessed the ROAs of 16 enterprises/corporations and noted that Six (6) entities, including; The Microfinance Support Centre Ltd, Mandela National Stadium, NEC AGRO SMC Limited, Insurance Training college, NEC Construction Works & Engineering Limited, and Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation posted a favourable ROA of over 5%. however, ten (10) enterprises/corporations registered a poor performance on ROA of below 5%. The worst performing enterprises were; Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Uganda Railways Corporation, Kilembe Mines Limited, Uganda National Airlines Company Limited and Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC).

The noted performance was mainly attributed to low revenue performance and high cost of operations for entities such as UBC, Uganda Airlines, CAA and Uganda Railways Corporation among others. For the electricity sub-sector, the low ROAs were attributed to a number of running projects which are still under Work in Progress (WIP) and not generating revenue (UEGCL & UETCL) and desire by GoU to reduce the electricity tariff which limits profitability of the related entities. For Kilembe Mines, the entity has continued to post a negative ROA mainly due to the fact that the mine is still under care and maintenance without the core business activity of mining due to the delayed divesture process. The table below refers;

This implies that the Companies/Corporations are not generating enough income from the use of their assets.

Similarly, I assessed the Return on Assets of the 4 financial institutions and noted that the ROA of the institutions improved compared to the previous year with exception of Pride Microfinance which a slight reduction of 0.3%. The details are shown in the table below;

3.3 The reduction in the ROA was attributed to the low Earnings before interest and tax of UGX 11,440,731,000 compared to UGX 15,484,355,000 of the previous year.

2.25 The Reduction in return on assets was attributed to an increase in the asset value by 9.49% (from UGX 674.555bn to UGX 745.29 bn in the year under review).

I advised the entities to institute mechanisms to increase income generation from use of their assets.

c) Dividends

I noted that, only Housing Finance Bank Limited declared a dividend pay-out of UGX.20.5Bn in the year under review. During the year, Uganda Property Holdings Limited and Housing Finance Bank Limited paid out dividends declared in the previous year totalling to UGX.400Mn and UGX.6.1Bn respectively.











d) Liquidity Assessment

I analysed the ability of Public Corporations and State enterprises to meet their short- term financial obligations by comparing the current assets and current liabilities using the Current Ratio analysis. Generally, the ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities between 1.5 and 2 is desirable, although acceptable current ratios vary between different industries or sectors.

I noted that thirteen (13) entities were above the ideal threshold, implying that they are able to meet their liabilities as they fall due. However, out of the 13 entities, 8 had excessively higher current ratios of 4 and above, these included UNOC, Mandela National Stadium, NEC Luwero Industries Limited and UEDCL among others. The very high current ratio implies that the Companies are not efficiently utilizing their current assets or short-term financing facilities.

Five (5) entities had ratios below 1.5 and may have a challenge of paying their obligations as and when they fall due, these included UEGCL, UBC, Kilembe Mines Limited, NEC Construction Works & Engineering Limited and Uganda National Airlines Company Limited. The table below refers.

2 Mandela 30.03 National Stadium

2020/2021 N/A Management explained that the company’s current ratio was significantly impacted by the recognition of funds related to GOU’s first (1 st ) tranche of the 15% shareholding in EACOP Co through UNOC, of UGX.480.9 billion. For the period between July 2022 – November 2022, the company paid USD.62.3 Million (equivalent to UGX.230.4 billion), as cash calls to EACOP Co. The current ratio should return to expected levels as the company continues to meet its cash call obligations to EACOP Co.

0.73 Management explained that the Board and Management engaged the Shareholders to recapitalize the company. As a result, Government funded the renovation and upgrade of Mandela National Stadium to international standards. This will make it marketable and attractive to business. Public Private Partnerships will be entered into to enhance the performance of the company.

For the financial institutions, I noted that the four (4) institutions were above the ideal threshold, implying that they are able to meet their liabilities as they fall due with an average current ratio of 3. The Uganda Development Bank had the highest ratio of 9.87 while Post Bank had the lowest ratio of 1.07. The details are as per the table below;

The increase in the Loans and advance deposits to customers is a sign of good performance for the Banks as long as there are no significant non-performing loans. e) Debt Analysis

Public Corporations and State Enterprises should be able to meet their short and long- term debt obligations. Gearing (debt) ratio measures the proportion of the enterprises’ assets that are financed by debt. Although the risk levels vary from industry to industry, a debt ratio of more than 50% is considered undesirable.

Twelve (12) out of the thirteen (13) Public Corporations and State enterprises assessed had debt ratios of less than 50% implying that owners’ equity was sufficient to cover total debt with the exception of NEC Uzima Limited which had a debt ratio above 50%. Further analysis noted that 11 Public Corporations and State enterprises had very low gearing levels below 10% indicating availability of untapped source of financing for growth. The table below refers.

I advised the enterprises to review their debt-to-equity mix and keep a balance to ensure entity profitability.

4.3. Overall Conclusion/Recommendation

Government established public corporations and state enterprises with an objective of ensuring efficient and effective management of government operations while delivering services to the citizens. I noted that 56% of the assessed companies made profits while others were not making profits, thus affecting their return on assets, ability to pay dividends to Government, and ability to settle their obligations as they fall due. Therefore, these companies should put in place strategies to improve their performance and deliver to the expectations of Government. In addition, Government should develop appropriate financial and non-financial performance assessment indicators for each category of Public Corporations and State Enterprises to enable comprehensive and standardised performance assessment.











PART 3: SECTORAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CROSS CUTTING FINDINGS

This part contains cross cutting key findings noted in the respective sectors and cross cutting service delivery issues in Local Governments.

A. Sectoral Key Findings 1.0. PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT

1.1. Delayed realignment of the Comprehensive National Development Framework (CNDPF) to the program planning approach

The National Planning Authority developed a comprehensive national development framework in 2009 to guide planning in the country. This framework was developed based on the sector wide approach to planning and budgeting and should have been realigned to the new programme-based approach to planning and budgeting with the shift from the sector wide approach. At the time of writing this report (December 2022), the CNDPF was yet to be re- aligned to the new programme approach to planning and budgeting. The CNDPF therefore in its current form therefore cannot appropriately guide planning at both national and entity level. I advised the NPA to ensure that the CNDPF adequately realigned to the programme- based planning and budgeting adopted by Government.

1.2. Progress towards full implementation of the programme development approach

The Programme Approach to planning was adopted so as to reduce the silo approach to planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring & evaluation (M&E), which always led to the duplication and wastage of resources. This approach was supposed to bring together stakeholders so as to achieve the delivery of common results, in an effective and efficient way. There have been areas of commendable performance towards transition by government to the programme approach for instance; Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) are providing the basis for planning, budgeting, implementation and M&E. In addition, the budgeting Systems have been adjusted to adopt the Programme approach which has improved the link between the Development Plan and the National Budget.

Despite these achievements there are areas that need attention; there is still resistance from some stakeholders to the intervention, there are capacity gaps at the entity level regarding this approach, limited funding to programme secretariats which affects their operations, there no service delivery standards and outcome indicators for measuring performance. In addition, only four (4) of the twenty (20) programmes had functional programme working groups and working procedures within some entity operations are still not fully aligned to the programmed approach.











were not registered and licensed, representing 48%. The balance of 134 schools were provisionally licensed. The provisional licenses for 102 out of the 134 schools had expired (exceeded the two years in operation) and had not been renewed, implying that the schools were operating illegally.

I further noted that except for the schools which were issued closure notices as far back as 2018 but are still operating, other schools had never been issued closure notices by KCCA. The above inactions affected service delivery, and the education service standards in the city schools are at risk of declining to worrying levels. This was attributed to the inadequate monitoring and enforcement by the KCCA education department. I advised the Accounting Officer to enhance the monitoring and enforcement of by the education department to ensure that all schools are dully licenced and registered.

1.4. Functionality of District Service Commissions

I noted that several Districts and Cities had not constituted Service Commissions contrary to section 54 (1) of the Local Government Act 1997. The table below refers

Table 56: Constitution and functionality of Service Commissions Status of DSC No of Districts & %age of total

Functional and fully Constituted-(5 members) Functional but not fully constituted (4 members)- Functional but not fully constituted (3 members) Functional but not fully constituted (2 members)

Cities DSCs 37 26 46 32 59 41 2 1 Not functional 1 1 Total 145 100

Failure to constitute District and City Commissions affects service delivery since recruitment, promotion and confirmation of staff cannot not be undertaken.

I advised MoLG to ensure that going forward all districts have fully functional district service Commissions as required by law.

1.5. Review of the Operations of the Kampala District Land Board

The Kampala District Land Board is mandated by Section 54 of the Land Act to manage all public land within Kampala on behalf of the citizens. I reviewed the operations of the board for the financial years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 and noted that the board did not have a substantive secretary, and there were no minutes for some of the meetings of the board. Further, the board had not prepared annual reports for the two years reviewed nor did the board prepare financial statements.











2.0. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

a) Review of Operations of missions

(i)

I noted that a number of Missions signed agreements with Insurance Companies for the provision of medical services to the Mission Officials. However, most of the insurance covers given to the foreign service officers did not cover heart diseases, diabetes, and major operations. As a result, officers have been forced to use their personal funds which is very costly for the foreign service officers. In some cases, the foreign service officers are forced to seek for refunds which contravenes the Public Service Standing Orders.

(ii)

PPDA issued abridged PPDA guidelines to be used by missions when undertaking procurements outside Uganda. These guidelines are however impractical in most cases given the unique circumstances and procurement requirements in the different host countries. As a result, there has been a lot of non-compliance to these guidelines.

(iii)

A review of the mission work plans and budgets revealed that most of missions were not provided with capital budgets in the past three years. As a result, missions were unable to undertake activities of a capital nature such as renovations of chanceries and offices, procurement of vehicles, and procurement of furniture. This undermines the efforts of promoting Uganda’s image abroad.

(iv)

I noted that Government continues to receive offers inform of trade opportunities, scholarships, financial offers among others. I however observed that Government does not have a comprehensive and effective system of follow-up on such offers. As a result, a number of offers have expired without action being taken by Government. This results in loss of a many opportunities for the country.

(v)

At the end of every financial year Missions are required to return unspent funds back to the UCF. However, a comparison between the amounts wired back as per the financial statements and the Navision system and the amount received as per the actual receipts given by treasury shows that the value of these transfers is lost through exchange losses and bank charges. A review of funds returned by a sample of six missions revealed that UGX.15.8Mn was lost in bank charges and foreign exchange losses on various transactions made to return these unspent balances in two financial years.











contravenes the constitution. I advised the Electoral Commission to engage stakeholders particularly MoFPED and Parliament for provision of resources to have these elections concluded.

3.0. AGRICULTURE SECTOR

a) Status of the Sugarcane production project in Northern Uganda

Government of Uganda owns 40% of the shares in Horyal Investments Holdings Company Limited (HIHC) whose main business is the establishment and running of the Atiak Sugar Factory. During the year Government allocated UGX 108Bn for purchase of agricultural mechanisation equipment to be given to HIHC under a finance lease arrangement.

Atiak sugar factory was an intervention started by Government under the sugar cane out growers scheme. It started at the pioneer sugarcane production site in Atiak sub county Amuru District, and subsequently expanded to two additional sites in Lamwo district, namely, Palabek Kal (Lamwo-1) and Palabek Nyimur (Lamwo 2).

At inception in 2017, the intervention targeted to establish 13,841 acres of sugarcane at the pioneer site at Atiak, 15,000 acres at Palabek kal and 31,159 acres at Palabek Ogili site. By October 2019 only 7,906 acres of sugar cane had been established at the pioneer production site in Atiak after which the contractor ceased operations at the site. Similarly, by end of 2020 only 4,994 acres had been established at Palabek Kal Production site.

At the time of writing this report in December 2022, the project operations were currently on hold pending the acquisition of machinery through UDC. The project had not performed as expected due to the following;

(i) Slow progress at the Atiak site was attributed to adverse weather, difficulties experienced by the contractor in mobilizing the required heavy machinery, and the heavy rains during season 2018B. (ii) Slow progress at the Palabek Kal production site was attributed to the shortage of seed cane within the proximity of the plantation site, difficulty in mobilizing labour and COVID 19. (iii) Fire outbreaks in 2020 also wiped out a substantial acreage especially at the production site in Atiak. (iv) The decision by the Shareholders (of HHIC Ltd) to halt operations after 2020 to allow for the proposed shift from the predominantly manual field operations mechanized farm operations under the oversite of Uganda Development Cooperation (UDC).











(Agriculture Value Chain Development (Production, Storage, Processing and Marketing) under the PDM for which an effective extension system will be required.

I reviewed the current extension system and noted gaps for example; there were no performance indicators for extension workers, out of the desired 9,275 extension workers only 4,031 (57%) are available, the extension workers face challenges of transport, inadequate training among others. These challenges were due to insufficient budget allocations for this activity.

I advised Government to prioritize this provision of extension services through recruitment and training of extension workers, and provision of transport since the success of the PDM is directly affected by the effectiveness of extension services.

4.0. JUSTICE LAW AND ORDER SECTOR

a) Review of the Performance of the Police Canine Unit

Uganda Police Force had a total of One hundred seventy-nine (179) dogs in the police canine unit; I reviewed the management of the dogs by the UPF and observed the following.

The dogs are deployed in seventy-eight (78) policing districts out of the total of one hundred forty-five (145) Policing districts, representing a coverage of 58%. More than 50% of these are within Kampala. The unit requires three (3) veterinary doctors and 22 veterinary assistants to handle medical requirements for the dogs out of which the unit only has one (1) veterinary doctor and nine (9) assistants who are all based at the Canine headquarters in Kampala.

The unit has thirty (30) vehicles, seven (7) of which are grounded due to mechanical issues. Out of the remaining twenty-three (23), eleven (11) are allocated to Kampala, and the rest (52%) are spread across regions which affects the transportation of the dogs. The above was attributed to inadequate funding and prioritization of the unit within UPF. I advised the Accounting Officer to develop measures that will improve the geographical spread and availability of the dogs. There is also need to recruit more veterinary doctors and provide more vehicles to the unit to facilitate movement by the unit.

b ) Operations of the forensic laboratory

The Police Forensics Unit was established to support criminal investigations by providing scientific means and study. This unit has four laboratories for; a) chemical, biological and radiology, b) questionable documents, c) criminal investigations, d) cybercrime and digital forensics. I reviewed the performance of these laboratories and noted the following;

- Out of the 446 cases received for chemical, biological, and radiology analysis, only 203 were analyzed and concluded, representing a performance of 46%.

- The questionable documents laboratory received 623 cases during the year 2021 in addition to a backlog of 1,161 at the beginning of the year. By the end of the year, only 511 cases were analysed and concluded, representing a performance of 29%

- The crime investigations laboratory had 407 scene of crime officers and only 224 Scene of Crime Officer kits, 210 cameras and 108 motorcycles. This implies that the available kits and cameras are insufficient since each of the Officers is expected to have a kit and camera at least.











- The cybercrime and digital forensics laboratory had a case backlog of 478 at the beginning of the year 2021 and received 330 cases during the year, out of these only 224 were analysed and concluded, representing a performance of 28%.

This performance affects completion of cases and delays administration of justice. The Accounting Officer explained that this was due to lack of sufficient funds to equip the laboratories and hire more staff. I advised the Accounting Officer develop strategies of ensuring that these laboratories are well staffed and equipped in order to improve their effectiveness.

c) Lack of a Laboratory Information Management System for the forensic unit

A Laboratory Information Management System is software that supports laboratory operations management. The software’s key functionality includes sample management, including tracking a chain of custody, workflow management, integration with other systems for real- time reporting, and any other information that the users may require to track.

I observed that Uganda Police’s Forensics Unit does not have a Laboratory Information Management System to manage its operations. As a result, the unit relies heavily on manual recording, which is cumbersome, inefficient, and prone to errors. I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure the implementation of a Laboratory Information Management System is fast tracked for improved operations.

d) Assessment of Road map for Mass Registration and Renewal of National IDs

NIRA is expected to undertake mass registration and mass renewal of the IDs that will be expiring in 2024. This will involve replacing old IDs with a next-generation ID system embedded with a microchip containing citizens’ electronic and biometric information.

I noted that at the time of writing this report in December 2022, the Authority did not have a clear strategy and roadmap on how and when the new IDs will be rolled out, the costs involved, sensitization arrangements of the public were also not clear and other key activities such as signing of contracts for supply of the blank cards, procurement of equipment and recruitment of staff to manage the exercise were yet to be undertaken. There is a risk that the Authority will face challenges due to the large number of applications in 2024 which will result in processing delays, congestion and frustration of applicants.

I advised the Accounting Officer to develop a comprehensive roadmap and strategy which will guide the planning and execution of this activity.











f) Underfunding of liabilities arising from Court awards and compensations

I noted that nine (9) entities owed a sum of UGX.604,091,207,112 in outstanding court awards at the start of the year. Whereas these entities declared their liability fully to the Ministry of Finance for budgeting and settlement, only UGX.26,622,994,920 (4%) was provided, leaving a balance of UGX. 577,468,212,192 unbudgeted. Details are in the table below.

The failure to provide a sufficient budget for liabilities resulted in delayed settlement and further accumulation of interest on the outstanding debt. For instance, I noted that as of the 30 th of June 2022, the outstanding awards at MoJCA had accumulated interest amounting to UGX.115,667,496,357, which is 73% of the principal amount awarded.

The Accounting Officers explained that the budgeting is not controlled by the respective entities but rather follow the budget ceiling provided by the Ministry of Finance; however, they pledged that they would continue to engage the relevant stakeholders, including The Presidential Advisory Committee on Budget (PACOB), the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and MoFPED, to provide sufficient budget provisions to cater for the settlement of arrears.

I advised the Accounting Officers to engage MoFPED to ensure that adequate resources are allocated to settle the arrears.











Of these, the 23 cases in the Ministry of Justice had accrued interest of approximately UGX. 105,646,446,256 by the 30 th of June 2022.

Delays to compensate affected parties result in further interest accumulation and deny timely delivery of justice. The Accounting Officers explained that whereas management is committed to the timely compensation of claimants, execution depends on the funding level availed by MoFPED.

I advised the Accounting Officers to put in place a system that ensures that claimants are compensated in time.

5.0. INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

a) Registration and certification of IT professionals and IT institutions without enabling regulation

Section 5(i) NITA-U Act, 2009 provides for the functions of the Authority to include; regulation of the information technology in Uganda in order to ensure its effective promotion and development. In addition, the Authority is required to act as an authentication centre for information technology training in Uganda in conjunction with the Ministry responsible for Education. However, I noted the following;

- The Authority is currently registering professionals and the training institutions without prescribed regulations and standards. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since 2017, 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while the 11 are expired.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs advised that a regulation for IT Professionals would not suffice in governing and or regulating the IT Profession. They recommended the development of an ICT Professionals Bill, which the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance is spearheading.

- Relatedly, the Authority has Service Provider Regulations but they lack timelines for certification of applicants. Consequently, clients of the Authority continue to operate without renewal of certification. From a sample examined, I observed that seven (7) companies were providing services to MDAs without certification.











However, I noted that UCC had not enforced the payment of a 2% gross annual levy on the licensed Television and FM radio operators, and no licensed Television and FM radio operator had submitted audited financial statements to the Commission for assessment.

Failure to collect a 2% Gross Annual Revenue levy from the operators deprives the Commission of revenue hence affecting the implementation of activities to deliver services to the public.

The Accounting officer explained that the Broadcasters under their Umbrella the National Association of Broadcasters appealed the levy to the Minister of ICT & National Guidance and the appeal had not yet been resolved.

I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up on the outcome of the appeal from the Minister of ICT & National Guidance. In the meantime, the Commission should comply with the provisions of the existing law and institute a mechanism to levy a charge on the GAR of the operators.

c) Operations of Smiles Telecommunications Limited

Part II of the Uganda Communications (fees and fines) Amendment Regulations 2020 states that an operator who without authority from the Commission discontinues its services licensed by the Commission is liable to a fine of up to 10% of the Gross Annual Revenue of the Operator.

M/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited discontinued its operations in January 2022 without any authorization from the Commission. UCC however, did not suspend or revoke the license as guided by the Act. The Commission did not fine M/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited for violating the terms and conditions of the issued license.

Furthermore, I noted that M/s Smiles Communications Uganda Limited has an outstanding obligation to UGX.227.300Mn and USD.505,079.47 payable to UCC. The Commission had not put any measures to recover this money from M/s Smiles Communications Uganda Limited. With the discontinuation of M/s Smiles Telecommunications Limited’s operations, the Commission is at risk of losing the outstanding revenue from the Company as well as loss of funds by the subscribers.











It was further explained that Smile took ATC to court citing irregular and unfair treatment leading to the disconnection. The case is still ongoing. The Commission is monitoring the progress of the court case as it also engages both ATC and Smile for a possible amicable settlement of the underlying dispute.

I advised the Accounting officer to put in place measures to ensure that the outstanding obligation is recovered from M/s Smile communications Uganda Limited, as I await the outcome of the ongoing initiatives on the matter.

d) Lack of a policy on confiscated equipment

Regulation 112(1&2) of the Uganda Communications Commission (Licensing) Regulations, 2019 stipulates that the Commission may upon an investigation, confiscate from a licensed operator or agent of an operator or any person any apparatus which is possessed, installed, connected or operated unlawfully. The owner of any apparatus confiscated by the Commission may appeal to the Uganda Communications Tribunal against the confiscation within 30 days.

On several occasions, the Commission has confiscated equipment from operators however, there are no laid down procedures on how this equipment should be stored, returned to the operators, or even destroyed and who is responsible for the costs thereof. This is attributed to the failure of the Accounting Officer to come up with the procedures, for the Board’s approval, on how the confiscated equipment should be managed.

The lack of a policy may lead to misuse of the confiscated equipment and may deepen disputes and cause financial losses to Government.

The Accounting Officer explained that the development of the policy on the management of the confiscated equipment was ongoing. The Policy was currently at the draft stage and management expects full approvals and policy to be in place by March 2023

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite the development of a policy on the management of the confiscated equipment to mitigate associated the risks.

e) Delayed completion of the National E-commerce Platform

The Commission is spearheading a project to design, build and pilot an enterprise-grade smart E-commerce platform that is aimed at supporting SMEs in the informal sectors of the Agriculture, Retail, and Services industry in Uganda, in order to promote access to online sales, overcome challenges in delivering too hard to reach communities and to spur economic growth. The National E-commerce platform seeks to develop and deploy an ICT-enabled platform through which SMEs in the targeted informal sector can reach wider national and international markets, enable seamless payments and banking and obtain data-driven business insights and manage their sales inventories.











With delayed completion of NEP, SMEs in the informal sector lose out on the benefits of E- commerce.

The Accounting officer explained that the completion of the platform development processes was affected by a prolonged delay in procurement and delivery of the high-performance computer with graphics processing unit capability and hosting server, caused by the global scarcity of computer chips. The specialized computer and server were however received at the end of October 2022 and the team was now completing the final installation and configuration of the systems. The project steering committee had prepared a final report to Management for consideration of the recommendations on how the project would be implemented beyond the development phase.

I advised the Executive Director to liaise with the project steering committee members to ensure that the NEP is completed and operational to support SMEs in the informal sector

f) Sharing of funds for information and communication technology development

Regulation 10 (1) (a) of the Uganda Communications (Universal Service and Access Fund) Regulations, 2019 provides that the Fund shall be utilised for information and communication technology development and rural communications. The percentage of the monies shall be shared between UCC and the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (MoICT).

However, the Regulation does not provide the sharing ratio and/or details against which the sharing would be based. During the year under review, the Commission budgeted to transfer UGX.6.5Bn to MoICT for its share from the information and communication technology development fund. The basis for arriving at this figure could not be supported.

Without the basis of the percentage sharing ratio, I was unable to establish how the amount transferred was arrived at. The lack of these ratios creates uncertainty in funding and may lead to inter-institutional funding conflict.

The Accounting Officer explained that the proportions are based on the Ministerial guidance issued by the Minister following the enactment of the Communications Act of 2013 in respect of ICT development.











However, I noted that the projected reduction in cost of the internet to USD.20 per MBPS has not materialized, despite an increase in the number of sites connected to the NBI/EGI. Failure to reduce the internet cost will deny service delivery such as affordable communication and electronic learning in both public and private institutions country wide.

The Accounting Officer explained that NITA-U had engaged PSST on the same and the final discussions are underway to reduce the cost to USD.35.

I await the outcome of the engagement with PSST and further urge the Accounting Officer to review the Internet Billing Card/costs to achieve the intended goal of increasing internet connectivity and affordability.

h) Weaknesses in certifying ICT service providers

NITA-U’s strategic goal Part 1, aims to achieve a well-regulated Information Technology (IT) environment in Public and Private Sector, while Part 2, is to Strengthen capacity and awareness creation about IT in Uganda (both institutional and human).

I sampled and observed from a total of Seven (7) companies that they were providing services to MDAs without certification by NITA-U and therefore compromising on the quality of services or goods received. A further review of the certification tool revealed that the Authority has been able to register 686 applications from inception and only 301 certifications are valid. The risk that unqualified and sub-standard works fill the market is highly likely and that insufficient consumer protection in regards to IT Services and Products goes un-monitored.

Management explained that NITA-U had instituted additional measures for renewal of certifications that had expired. They also continue to partner with key stakeholders such as Bank of Uganda, Lotteries and Gaming Regulatory Board, heads of PDUs, Professional Associations and others who require that their licensees/ bidders for IT Services obtain the NITA-U certification before they apply for a license/bid for services.

I advised the Accounting Officer to institute measures of follow-up and management of the certification process of the IT service providers country wide.

i) Refund to World Bank of ineligible EGP funds - USD.249,500

Government of Uganda (GoU) with funding under RCIP Phase V, invested in the E-Government Procurement system (e-GP system) and contracted a supplier at an initial system acquisition cost of USD.1,347,000. However, in a letter dated 26th June 2020 from the MoFPED and addressed to the Executive Director NITA-U, the government expressed concerns about the approach of the System provider and the long-term sustainability of the e-GP system project. Reference is also made to an Aide Memoire from the World Bank dated 8th – 12th February 2021, in which the World Bank acknowledged receipt of a termination request of the e- Procurement Contract.











Undertaking project expenditures without obtaining the required no-objections exposes the project to a risk of suspension by the World Bank of disbursements of funds to qualifying project expenditures that are supported by the Bank.

Management explained that the World Bank guideline was complied with. However, the payment was made based on the approval for termination of the contract by the Steering Committee under the MOFPED and a no objection by the World Bank.

I advised the Accounting Officer to always comply with the World Bank guidelines to avoid penalties that will cost Government.

6.0. ACCOUNTABILITY SECTOR

a) Un-funded Approved Consolidated Budget

The PFMA, 2015 Section 15 (1) and (2) requires that after approval of the annual budget by Parliament, the Secretary to the Treasury shall issue the annual cash flow plan of the Government, based on the procurement plans, work plans, and recruitment plans approved by the Parliament. The annual cash flow plan shall form the basis for the release of funds by the Accountant General to the Accounting Officers.

During the financial year 2021/2022, Parliament appropriated an initial budget of UGX.44.778Tn which was later revised to UGX.51.562Tn through a supplementary budget of UGX.6.784Tn, to finance Government expenditure as summarised in the table below;

Table 59: Government budget performance per spending category Initi Revise Total Actual Unwarrant Unutilized % % al d warrant expenditu ed funds warrants warrante Warrants Budg budge s re (UGX (UGX Tn) (UGX-Tn) d funds spent et t (UGX Tn) E=B-C F=C-D (UGX (UGX Tn) D Tn) Tn) C A B

Total 44.78 51.562 48.854 44.435 2.708 4.419 94.75 90.95 Source: OAG analysis of the Government budget performance report











Failure to fully fund the revised budget affected the implementation of the planned activities which were intended to contribute to the achievement of the NDP III and Vision 2040.

I advised Government to adopt prudent budgeting principles by periodically reviewing its priorities against the funding mix and ensuring that all supplementary appropriations are supported by new funding sources. Besides, Management should warrant funds based on the money available in the consolidated fund.

b) Public debt portfolio analysis

The reported total public debt as at 30 th June 2022 stood at UGX.86.6Tn, of which Domestic Debt Stock was UGX.38.1Tn and the External Debt Stock was valued at UGX.48.5Tn. This is an increase of UGX.11.5Tn, equivalent to 15.31% when compared to the debt stock of UGX.75.1Tn reported as of 30 th June 2021. Refer to Table below for details;

Table 60: Government Debt Stock Financial year Domestic debt Foreign debt Total (UGX Tn) % change ended (UGX Tn) (UGX Tn) June 2022 38.1 48.5 86.6 15.3% June 2021 30.8 44.3 75.1 24.3% June 2020 18.0 38.2 56.9 23.5% June 2019 15.2 30.9 46.1 11.1% June 2018 13.1 28.4 41.4 Source: Audited financial statements of Vote 130

From the above analysis, it was noted that there has been a consistent increase in the total debt as evidenced by an increase of 109% in the five years from 2017/18 (UGX.41.4Tn) to UGX.86.6Tn as at 30 th June 2022. The net increase in debt is due to increased borrowing from both domestic and external sources, with domestic debt accounting for a higher increase. The composition and trend of debt are highlighted in the figure below;

Public debt is continuously on the rise, a fact that is attributed to persistent budget deficits (mismatch of Government revenue and expenditure), rollover of liquidity papers, Bond switches, private placements, new borrowings for various development projects and foreign exchange loss arising from the depreciation of Ugandan Shilling against stronger currencies. I advised that Government should prudently project and manage the funding mix as well as review its priorities to avoid escalation of debt beyond a sustainable level.











2019/20 18 2.5 16.0				
2018/19	15.5	2.4	18.7	
2017/18 13.1				




From the above, it is evident that domestic debt has kept growing over the years at an average rate of more than 23.1%.

Continued reliance on Net Domestic Financing signals the Government’s borrowing appetite, whereby the market players are inclined to demand increased rates well aware of the fact that Government is in dire need to finance the budget.

In addition, commercial banks will prefer lending to the Government instead of the private sector thus crowding out the private sector.

I have advised Government to consider initiating steps to reverse this trend and ensure fiscal budget discipline and promptly servicing a portion of such domestic obligations including interest.

d) Assessment of debt sustainability i.Debt to GDP ratio

The Debt to GDP ratio is a measure that compares what a country owes (total debt) and what it produces (manufactures or a service provided). The ratio reliably indicates a country’s ability to pay back its debt. A high debt-to-GDP ratio may make it more difficult for a Country to pay both internal and external debt and may lead creditors to seek higher interest rates to compensate for financing risk due to likely default or unnecessary debt extension.

Though the IMF has recommended 50% as the point of safety, many developed countries have gone up to 200%. However, according to the IMF, developing countries are more prone to economic shocks and exchange rate risk, thus advising on a 50% threshold. A review of Uganda’s Debt to GDP revealed a consistent linear growth over five years and in the year under review, it was noted that Debt to GDP grew by 22% from 31% to 53%. The graph below illustrates the movement;

Graph showing Debt to GDP ratio 200











From the above, it can be seen that though Uganda’s GDP has been increasing over the years since FY2016/17, its debt position has also increased. The rate of increase of debt is higher than the rate of increment in the GDP levels, which creates a risk factor of accumulation of unsustainable debt.

The Country is now at the set benchmark by the World Bank for unsustainable Debt. I noted that the country is already facing the impact of public debt which is evidenced by debt restructuring and the high cost of borrowing offered by the lenders. In the FY 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, Treasury restructured debt totalling to UGX.0.9Tn by way of bond switches that attracted an additional interest of UGX.1.2Tn.

The Government should consider exploring ways of reducing dependence on debt while exploring avenues of enhancing revenue generation for the country and/or reducing/rationalising government expenditures and investments.

ii.Interest to total revenue ratio

The country’s risk benchmark sets the maximum proportion of the domestic revenue that goes into servicing domestic interest costs. Since donor grants are inherently subject to uncertainty, the interest cost of domestic debt is considered in relation to the domestic-raised component of the budget only. The table below shows the trend of the interest accruing against the risk benchmark over the 5 year period;

Table 62: Interest in the total revenue ratio Financial year Total domestic Total Interest – % of Interest Benchmark Revenue – UGX-Tn to revenue UGX-Tn 2021/22 22.8 5.5 24.1 <12.5

2020/21 19.9 3.98 20.0 <12.5 2019/20 17.5 2.5 14.2 <12.5 2018/19 17.1 2.0 11.71 <12.5 2017/18 15.2 1.9 12.73 <12.5

The interest-to-revenue surpassed the risk benchmark as illustrated in the graph above. During the year, 24.1% (UGX. 5.5Tn) of the revenue collected was utilised towards the interest payments and UGX.1.4Tn in principal debt repayment representing 6% of the domestic revenue collected. Therefore 30.1% (UGX.6.9Tn) of the total revenue collected was used to service the debt (principal and interest) leaving only 69.9% (UGX.15.93Tn) available for funding other critical Government expenditures.











Under-collection of revenue affects the overall delivery of Public services by Government and leads to the escalation of public debt as borrowing increases to close budget funding gaps.

URA Management explained that the organisation is focused on closing all revenue collection loopholes by revamping the Business Intelligence tool (e-hub) into a data lake to facilitate big data analytics for compliance support in audits and investigations; Working with the Government to curb tax expenditures in the form of exemptions, allowances rate reliefs among others.

I commended URA Management on the revenue collection improvements and urged the Accounting Officer to make all necessary efforts to close revenue collection loopholes to ensure sustainable collection of the planned revenue.

f) Pending Tax Appeals

A review of the tax disputes received and managed by Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) revealed that 163 cases with a value of UGX.356.7Bn were pending before the Tribunal. This was attributed to the inadequate numbers of Tribunal members that limit their ability to hear and make timely rulings for all the tax appeals the Tribunal receives timely. Included in the pending cases is one case for VAT and exercise duty amounting to UGX.14.19Bn which has been outstanding for more than 11 years. Below is the ageing list of tax cases;

Table 63: Ageing analysis for pending cases No of Details cases 15 Cases of more than 2 years 23 Cases above 1 (one) year and less than 2 (two) years 125 Cases below one year

Taxes Amount in contention – UGX Bn 85.8 111.6 159.3 163 Total 356.7 Source: OAG Analysis

Long outstanding tax disputes lock potential Government revenue that would have been used to deliver services and is a disincentive for effective tax mobilization.

Management explained that mediation has been adopted at the Tribunal and this has helped resolve 70% of the tax disputes. Management further explained that the TAT Act was amended this year in June 2022 to allow for 4 more members. However, the operationalisation of this has been pushed to the subsequent year when funds are available.

- I noted that a total of UGX.340Bn in taxes had not been collected from Gold exports valued at UGX.6.962Tn for the year under review. Management attributed non- collection to the Minister’s statutory guidance of staying the implementation of the 5% export levy.

- There was no documented step-wise processes on how the importation and exportation of precious minerals should be handled by the customs officials. The processes are not embedded in the customs business compendium despite precious minerals being of high value, exposing the Authority to a risk of loss of revenue.











- I noted that the exportation of Gold was being processed manually, with only two entries captured during the year under review.

The Government is at risk of loss of revenue if the Minister’s statutory guidance is not reviewed and the processes are not enhanced.

I advised the Accounting Officer to streamline documentation of mineral imports and exports and engage the Minister responsible to enforce the Mining (Amendment) Act 2021. In addition, the Authority should initiate to recover the taxes due up to the date when the new law became effective.

h) Weaknesses in management of digital stamps

UNBS / URA and a Supplier executed a framework contract for the supply, implementation, training, commissioning, support and maintenance of a DTS Solution, dated 4 th October 2018, for a period of five (5) years, effective from the Go-Live Date at the unit prices specified in the Contract. The DTS solution involves affixing digital stamps (specialised paper stamps or digital imprints) on all excisable gazetted products as and when they are manufactured or imported with information being transferred to URA in near real-time. The solution enables the tracking and tracing of the product throughout the supply chain.

The digital stamp fees are collected by URA and remitted to the Supplier. The fees structure varies from commodity to commodity but includes UGX.3 for UNBS conformity stamps. I reviewed the contract and noted that there was delayed implementation of the conformity stamps by Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) because of lack of the regulations.

Management attributed this delay to the long process of formulating regulations as required by the law. As a result, UNBS has failed to claim the conformity stamp levy totalling UGX.19.754Bn.

Failure to implement Digital Conformity Stamps not only affects UNBS revenue performance but also derails the Governments focus on ensuring compliance to Quality Standards aimed at reducing substandard items in the market.

I advised the Accounting Officer to expedite formulation of the Digital Conformity Stamps Regulations.











I noted that the GOU in the FY 2020/21 decided to cancel three loans that had been contracted, as shown in the Table below;

Table 64: Cancelled loans S Loan particulars N 1 Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant 2 Construction of Muzizi Hydropower Plant 3 KfW Grant Finance (Euros) TOTAL

The following observations were noted;

Loan Amount (Euro- Date of signing Mn) 40 25 November 2016 45 09 December 2016 5.36 22 September 2015 90.36

i. I noted that from the date of execution of the said loan to the cancellation, the GoU had paid to the KFW a total of UGX.3.967Bn in commission fees for unutilised funds. This in effect caused a financial loss to the GOU of the said amount as there was no benefit for the said money. The failure to absorb the funds therefore can be categorised as a nugatory expense.

ii.

In a letter dated 14 th July 2022, the KFW indicated that the total amount payable for the cancellation of the loan would be Euro.1,171,875 as cancellation and commitment fees. The said letter was countersigned by the Minister of Finance on 11 th July 2022.

iii. The audit noted that the initial agreement entered into by the GOU and the KFW had a draw-down period of 30 th December 2021. Following the lapse of the draw-down period, the government successfully secured a renewal of the facility. The same facility was subsequently cancelled which cost the GOU a total of Euro.1,171,875 (Equivalent to UGX.4.657Bn). This payment amounts to an unnecessary payment which could have been avoided either by allowing the facility to lapse or not renewing it before cancellation.

iv. There is no evidence that the Minister sought the advice of the Attorney general before the cancellation process was undertaken.

v. A review of the status reports provided to the MOFPED by UEGCL on the execution of the project revealed that the UEGCL had expensed some funds totalling UGX.2.695Bn towards the compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and acquisition of land. This indicates that the additional expense of GOU if not properly secured could also be a nugatory expenditure by government.











The Tororo – Gulu Railway Line will go a long way to divert cargo from road to rail and create an alternative mode of transport which is cheaper and more environmentally friendly because of less emission of green gasses. This route will also provide a link between the port of Mombasa and Northern and Eastern Uganda, as well as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo

On 16 th December 2019, The Government of Uganda signed a grant financing agreement of up to 34.6 million Euros with the European Commission. The grant termination date was 10 th December 2023. I noted the following;

k) Failure to honour GOU co-financing obligation leading to termination

In the Grant agreement signed between the GOU and the EU the parties resolved that the total cost of the project would be Euros.34,600,000 of which the GOU would be responsible for the financing of a total of Euros.13,100,000.

Contrary to article 65.1 of the grant agreement, GOU defaulted on their contribution to payment of the contractor. This resulted in the termination of the contract by the contractor. By the time of termination, Euros.3,112,726.52 was due to the contractor. As at 30 th August 2022, only 15.47% work had been completed. Article 65.3 states that in the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the contractor for any loss or damage the contractor may have suffered. The maximum amount shall be 10% of the contract price.

As a result of the termination, the Government of Uganda will incur termination damages up to 10% (Euros.3,933,775.6). According to the Monthly progress report no. 34 of August 2022, Termination claim 3 had not yet been submitted by the contractor for final determination and estimation of amounts due. A review of the Treasury Operations financial statement indicated that no contingent liability had been provided for/ disclosed with respect to the outstanding claim.

I advise the Accounting Officer to provide for the liability in the financial statements.

l) Conflict of PFMA and Financial Institutions Act

Sections 35 and 81 of the PFMA 2015 provide guidance on the processes and procedures to be taken when executing a proposal to write off a public asset by the GOU. This indicates that unless the Parliament resolves and authorizes a write-off of any asset, no write-off can be undertaken with the limited exception of a write-off by the minister under section 35(4).











7.0. ENERGY SECTOR

a) Rampant Vandalism of the Electricity Infrastructure

I noted cases of increased vandalism on UETCL’s installations specifically the transmission lines, substations and towers. Examples of stations which have been vandalised include; Namanve substation - theft of capacitor banks, Queen’s way substation - theft of copper cables, Soroti substation - theft of transformer oil, NELSAP Transmission Line - destruction of towers and vandalism.

In the FY 2021/22 UETCL incurred UGX 494.15Mn to purchase Galvanized Angle bars to replace vandalized tower members excluding replacement costs. Further analysis revealed that the company also incurred UGX 1.56Bn in replacement costs on assorted transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021.

According to a management report, 135 towers were vandalised and re-instated in the period between May 2021 and June 2022. In the last four (4) months preceding December 2022, 255 (53% of the prior year number) had been vandalised and reinstated.

In addition Management asserted that it had spent UGX 3.86Bn to provide a temporary solution in form of wooden structures so as to restore supply. The estimated cost of replacing a 220kV tower is UGX. 220Mn and UGX. 120Mn for a 132kV tower. This translates to UGX. 12.72Bn for the collapsed towers after vandalism within a period of two years.

The total estimated cost including the cost of repairs, replacement and security is UGX 16.58Bn as at 15 th December 2022.

Failure to stump out the vice by Government may cause severe socio-economic consequences including retarding economic growth.

The Accounting Officers in the electricity sub-sector explained that the recent vandalism was unprecedented, and it has become a national security matter whereby Government security agencies have been asked to take up the matter, and a number of arrests made.

I advised Government to ensure that the security of the power infrastructure is enhanced to safeguard the integrity of the power lines, substations and the attendant equipment.











maintenance manuals to guide the staff on the safety precautions that needed to be undertaken.

There is a risk that if these snags are not addressed in a timely manner, the costs of the owners’ engineer and feasibility of the project may affect the overall plant effectiveness. Furthermore, the risk of the flooding re-occurring cannot be ruled out if the causes are not clearly established and rectified in a timely manner.

The Accounting Officer explained that the EPCC has committed to fix all outstanding defects before the defects liability period ending 31 st March 2023. UEGCL is preparing a claim against EPCC.

I advised the responsible Accounting Officer to ensure that the snags are rectified in time. Going forward, a robust maintenance place should be put in place and implemented.

8.0. GENDER AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR

a) Inadequate measures to curb the increasing number of street children

The Ministry did not regularly carry out activities to control and manage street children by identifing gaps and suggesting recommendations towards eliminating them and improving their welfare. Whereas the Ministry estimates that the number of street children could be 1,000, only 292 could be accounted for leaving 708 children untraceable.

This was caused by inadequate allocation of financial resources and staffing gaps for community development workers at the districts to carry out their activities relating to child protection.

There is a risk that the street children will continue to be a challenge to the country which could eventually result into increased urban crimes.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry had a strategy for management of street children which is used alongside other Policies and enacted laws like the National Child Policy 2020 and its Implementation Plan (FY 2020/2021-2024/50, Practical Guidelines for Working on Street Children, Prevention of Trafficking in Persons (PTIP) Act, 2009, Kampala Capital City Child Protection Ordinance 2022 and the Local Government Act (1997 as amended- Child Care and Protection is a decentralized Service under Schedule II). He further explained that the Ministry had withdrawn a total of 1,582 children from Kampala streets, transported and rehabilitated them at Kobulin Youth Skilling Centre, Napak District during the period 2017 to 2022. I advised the Accounting Officer to engage relevant stakeholders and institute measures to eliminate or control existance of street children. In addition, the Accounting Officer should consider engaging the source communities and address causal factors.











9.0. LAND SECTOR

a) Management of Public Land

Government of Uganda owns land both in Uganda and abroad. This land is held for purposes of service delivery to Citizens. Section 45 of the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA), 2015 (as amended) requires the Accounting Officers across Government to be responsible for the management of the land under their custody. A review of the Management of Public land in 56 selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Authorities (LAs), over a four year period ending 30th June 2022, revealed the following;

(i) Planning & Budgeting for Land Acquisition

Instruction 3.9.5 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 requires the budget estimates to be based on the pre-determined objectives and outputs as provided in the strategic plans of the sector or entity. A review of a sample of 56 MDA’s and LA’s, revealed that 40.47 hectares of Government land acquired at UGX 0.647Mn in the period under review were not adequately planned for in the various entity Strategic Plans and 6.4 hectares costing UGX 0.627Bn were acquired by MDAs and LAs but had not been adequately budgeted for. The un-budgeted acquisitions were not aligned to the development goals and priorities as per the NDP III, sector, entity plans and budgets.

I also noted that out of the total budget of UGX 8.9Bn for land acquisition, UGX 7.3Bn (82%) was availed, resulting into a shortfall of UGX 1.6Bn (18%). Funding shortfalls resulted into Government’s failure to acquire 45 hectares of land planned for infrastructure development to enhance service delivery. The funding gap was attributed to budget cuts due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.

I advised the PS/ST to engage all Accounting Officers and Parliament to ensure that all budget allocations are aligned to the Development Goals as set out in the NDP III. In addition, I advised the PS/ST to ensure that the planned and appropriated allocations for Land acquisition are released.

( ii) Registration, titling and reporting of land

Section 49 (c) of the Land Act, Cap 227 requires the Uganda Land Commission to procure certificates of title for land vested in or acquired by the Government.











Furthermore, whereas Government leased out several pieces of land, I noted irregularities such as; double allocation of leases, allocation of leases by entities without mandate to lease out Government land, breach of lease terms and conditions. I further noted MDAs and LGs with expired and un-renewed leases and non-payment of lease rentals.

This has led to increased risk of litigation and associated costs, loss of land and revenue, thereby negatively affecting service delivery to the citizens.

I advised the Accounting Officers to enforce the securing of titles for all Government land and proper recording of Asset registers by the respective MDA’s and LG’s as well as maintenance of a comprehensive national register for Government land by the ULC.

(iii) Utilisation and encumbrance of land

Instruction 16.13.12 of the Treasury Instruction, 2017 requires that to control an asset, a Government entity should usually be the predominant user of the asset.

Out of a sample of 56 MDA’s and LG’s, I noted that 19 pieces of land measuring approximately 20.786 hectares out of the 631 pieces of land measuring approximately 2384.78 hectares were not utilized by 12 entities at the time of Audit. This was majorly attributed to inadequate funding to develop the land as planned.

Un-utilised land if not secured is susceptible to loss via encroachment or land grabbing.

In addition, 2 entities had a total of 4 pieces of land measuring approximately 961 hectares which had encumbrances in the form of; encroachment by the local population, court injunctions and claims by other parties.

I advised the PS/ST to harmonize the planning, funding, acquisition and utilisation of all Government land. This will minimize instances of wastage though non-utilisation and loss of public resources.

(iv) Management of Land by Uganda Land Commission

Section 49 of the Land Act Cap 227 requires the Uganda Land Commission to hold and manage all the land in Uganda which is vested in or acquired by the Government including land acquired by the Government abroad.











I advised the Accounting Officers to comply with the Act. In addition, Government should harmonise the requirements of the Land Act and other statutes. The MDAs/LGs should institute measures to ensure that their land is safeguarded.

(v) Irregularities in Management of leased Land

Regulation 6 of the Land Regulations, 2004 requires a lease offer made by a Board or the Commission to communicate the offer, stating the terms and conditions of the offer conditioned upon payment of fees and other charges, in full or by instalment.

I observed that 5 entities leased 175 pieces of land measuring approximately 60,518.826 hectares in the period. However the following irregularities were noted;

- 2 entities without mandate to lease out Government land allocated 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares.
- 2 entities allocated 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares to more than one beneficiary.
- 5 lease agreements were in breach of lease terms and conditions for example; expired and un-renewed leases and non-payment of lease rentals.
- ULC leased out 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 25 hectares without consulting the primary user agencies.

The above irregularities expose Government to risks of litigation and associated costs and loss of public land.

I advised the Boards and Commision to enforce proper management of leases for Government land.

b) Under utilization of funds by USMID – AF project

A total of UGX.339.9Bn (USD.92Mn) remained unutilised over a period of three years (2019/2020 - 2021/2022) even when there are signed commitments for infrastructure contracts and the funds have not been released to the implementing entities.

These funds included UGX 268Bn for 22 Program Cities/MCs and UGX.64Bn for the 8 refugee hosting districts.











10.0. EDUCATION SECTOR

a) Delayed Finalisation of Education Policies and other frameworks

During the previous financial year (2020/2021), the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) drafted several policies, including; the National Inclusive Education Policy; the National Higher Education Policy; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy; the Education Management Information System (EMIS) Policy; the Instructional Materials Policy; and the School Health Policy, which were not concluded.

In the year under review, the Ministry planned to conclude several policies and draft others, such as; National Curriculum Assessment, and Placement Policy; School Feeding Policy; Inspection and Quality Assurance Policy, the private Education Provision Policy, among others.

Additionally, I noted that at the time of concluding the audit (December, 2022), the Ministry had not concluded the development and issuing of some of the planned policies, bills and other frameworks. For instance; some draft policies have been pending for a while, only one out of the eight policies have been passed and a number are pending the issuance of the certificate of financial implication. The details are shown in the table below;

The lack of approved policies affects the Ministry’s ability to effectively and efficiently influence decision making processes and improve service delivery in the Education Sector. In addition, the monitoring and supervision of education activities becomes a challenge in the country.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry had not concluded the development of the planned policies mentioned. This was due to the prolonged process of developing them which involves consultations with several stakeholders including the public to solicit their views and for ownership. This is a requirement by Cabinet before they are submitted for approval. However, all the policies mentioned had been consulted upon and were awaiting approval by Cabinet.

I advised the Accounting Officer to liaise with all stakeholders and fast-track the completion and approval of the above mentioned policies and other frameworks to enable efficient and effective deliverance of educational services.

b ) Delayed Review of the Education Curricula for the different education institutions

A review of the Needs Assessment study report on Uganda Community Polytechnic Education dated February 2022, indicated that the Curriculum review of the Uganda Community Polytechnic Curriculum was last undertaken in 2008. In the year under review, I noted that only three (3) (5.7%) courses had been reviewed out of the fifty-two (52) courses. This has an impact on the quality of trainees and graduates and their competitiveness in the job market.











Furthermore, I noted that there was no Business and Technical Vocational Qualifications Framework in place rendering it difficult for UBTEB to effectively execute its mandate. This renders it difficult to equate qualifications hence limiting competitiveness in the global job market. Relatedly, there was no central database for technical education and training, and national qualifications. The lack of a centralized technical qualification database affects the Government's ability to have an accurate, reliable, and robust data on all qualifications in the country that facilitates comparability/equation, recognition and global placements in the job market.

I advised the Accounting Officers to address the above fore metioned challenges to enhance the quality of the learners and their competitiveness in the job market.

c) Sports Management and Administration by the National Council of Sports (NCS)

I reviewed the mandate, operations and management of NCS and noted the following;

(i)

Whereas NCS has the mandate to promote quality physical education and sports in the country, it was noted that there is inadequate sports management and administration. In the year under review, NCS released a sum of UGX.13.40Bn (100.3%) out of the budgeted UGX. 13.43Bn to a number of sports Associations and Federations.

(ii)

A number sports associations and federations were facing structural and operational challenges, including the failure to properly account for the funds disbursed to them resulting into UGX. 270Mn remaining unaccounted for.

(iii)

NCS regulates over 52 sports disciplines; however, there is currently a shortage of academies (grassroots sports schools) in a number of the disciplines. For example, whereas football and boxing disciplines had 77 and 57 sports academies, respectively, 25 sports disciplines had no sports academies at all.

(iv)

There was inadequate technical capacity in terms of personnel with internationally accredited skills. There were few coaches, Umpires, referees and sports medical personnel for most of the sports disciplines.











11.0. WORKS SECTOR

a) Loss on Compensation for Stolen Materials from Steel Companies- UGX.12,757,503,000

During the year, the Managing Director of Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) instituted an investigation on the stolen and recovered railway materials from two steel companies. However, the review of the investigation reports and other documents related to stolen and recovered railway materials revealed that URC went into an out of court settlement which resulted into a total compensation loss of UGX. 12.76Bn from both the two steel companies and an indication that the legal cases were mismanaged.

Management explained that the computation was based on sections that had been vandalised over the years and not the materials that the two companies were found with. This was done as a deterrent measure against the two companies in order to discourage them from buying vandalised materials. It was further explained that it is difficult to prove that the two companies were responsible for vandalising sections of the line yet the materials recovered were not for the whole section. The factory in Mukono negotiated to pay less as it claimed to be on the verge of bankruptcy due to Covid 19. Management considered it prudent to secure the settlement amount.

I advised the Board to review the process of out of court settlement to ensure transparent and verifiable procedures. In the event that collusion is identified, appropriate action including recovery measures from responsible parties should be instituted.

b ) Loss of Abandoned Dismantled Railway Materials-EUR.3,083,846.54 and unrecovered advance payment of EURO 8,854,839.68

The PSST/National Authorising Officer of the European Development Fund (EDF)-Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (PSST/NAO) signed a contract with a contractor on 21st November 2019 for Civil works for the Rehabilitation of the Tororo-Gulu Railway under contract reference number EUROPWAID/139549/IH/WRKS/UG at Contract price of EUR 39,337,756 (excluding VAT/other taxes). My review of the contract implementation revealed that after termination of the contract by the contractor, the contractor never handed over the demolished materials that were supposed to be used for reconstruction of the railway line. Evidence from supervising consultant indicated that 136,416 railway items equivalent to Euro 3,083,846.54 had been stolen. Similarly, the Contracting Authority made 30% advance payment to the same contractor amounting to EURO 11,801,326.80, by the time of termination of the contract only EURO 2,946,487.12 had been recovered with the balance EURO 8,854,839.68 not yet recovered.











c) Loss of Potential Revenue from a Concession Agreement for Pamba Ferry

On 18th May 2020, the Minister of State for Transport signed an agreement between the Government of Uganda and Mango Tree (U) Ltd, to rehabilitate and upgrade the Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba without recourse to public funds as a PPP. I however noted that there was no procurement process followed in identifying the company. I also noted that Mango Tree (U) Ltd incurred a verified amount of UGX.10,618,736,676 to undertake the refurbishment, which funds are to be recovered from the collections charged by the firm during operations. Although the Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba operated during the year, there were no arrangements by URC in respect to monitoring of revenue collected by the operator of the vessel and also the revenue sharing terms which would allow both parties to mutually benefit as required in the agreement.

The Accounting Officer explained that engagements with the Ministry of Works and Transport will continue to ensure that a revenue sharing agreement is established.

The Accounting Officer should establish a verifiable monitoring mechanism of the operations of (MV) Pamba to keep track of the revenue performance. In addition, the Accounting Officer is advised to engage the line Ministry and ensure that a revenue sharing agreement is established.

d) Delayed Completion of the consultancy for the unit cost study for road construction and maintenance in Uganda

On 30 th July 2019, the Ministry entered into a contract for a unit cost study for road construction and maintenance in Uganda at a contract price of UGX.2,102,966,500. The contract was to be executed in nine (9) months from the date of contract signing, implying that the contract completion date was supposed to be 30 th April, 2020.

A review of the performance of the contract revealed the following: -

i. Although the cumulative payments to the consultant totalled to UGX.1,472,076,550 (70% of the contract price) by end of September 2022, almost 2 & ½ years later, most aspects of the contract such as testing the cost management system, 2 nd stakeholders’ workshop, final report, cost estimation and monitoring systems and implementation strategy had not been delivered.

ii. Although, section 7.6 of Terms of Reference (TORs) for the study required six (6) staff from MoWT, UNRA, KCCA and Uganda Road Fund to be attached to the Consultant as counterpart staff for training and technology transfer, there was no evidence that it was done.











important to highlight that access to offices and documents was necessary for the majority of the Consultancy's primary activities.

I advised the Accounting Officer to follow up with the Consultant to ensure that the report is delivered expeditiously to enhance decision making.

e) Maintenance of district and zonal road equipment

I carried out inspection of the regional mechanical workshops and established that 23 Districts’ road equipment, especially Motor graders remained in the Workshops’ yards for more than a year without repair with some having been grounded since 2016.

This has affected the maintenance of roads in the affected districts.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Regional Workshops received only UGX.10,492,000,000 as operational funding against an actual requirement of UGX.45,000,000,000 thereby not able to carry out all the necessary repairs.

I advised the Accounting Officer to lobby the responsible authorities and have the road equipment maintenance budget improved.

f) Grounded Aircrafts at the East African civil Aviation Academy

The inspection of the East African civil Aviation Academy (Soroti Flying School) indicated that all its nine (9) training aircrafts were grounded due to the expiry of their insurance or being faulty. I further noted that three aircrafts involved in accidents during the year under review had not been repaired due to the delayed compensation by the insurance service provider.

The training of pilots had been suspended resulting into un-necessary costs of keeping students on the campus without training and extension of the time within which students would complete their courses. In addition, salaries for the Instructors and staff are being paid without activities, which is wasteful.

The Accounting Officer explained that the financial challenges have derailed the Academy from executing its mandate. It was further explained that the Academy procured an insurance service provider (Sanlam) at a cost of UGX.570,832,735, however after accepting the offer, the Academy received a late communication from Sanlam declining to offer the service. The issue has however been escalated to the Attorney General for further guidance on the next action against Sanlam Insurance. In addition, 5X-UAN 310 aircraft was manufactured in 1978 whose production line had been stopped, hence the Academy had to make special arrangements for the production of the parts required. It should also be noted that the aircraft was undergoing major structural repairs which required lots of parts.











Further UNRA has a policy of approving certificates within 60 days by a committee appointed by the Accounting Officer, however, I noted that the approval process takes much longer and by the end of the year the un approved certificates had accumulated to UGX.144.3Bn.

Accumulation of liabilities lead to interest payments related to non-settlement of certificates issued for work done leading to escalation of construction costs. Furthermore, it paints a bad picture on road contracts and some intrinsic costs may be built in the contract to cater for delays leading to high cost contracts. During the year an amount of UGX.41.34Bn was paid as interest for delayed payment for various projects.

The Accounting Officer explained that the exercise for the verification and approval of works certificates is a very lengthy because of the technicalities and the amounts involved. Furthermore, the delayed release of funds also leads to late payments hence interest penalties.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage the MoFPED with a view of securing additional resources to settle the liabilities. I also advised the Accounting Officer to review the payment approval process and payment terms to mitigate the risk of interest charges due to penalties

12.0. HEALTH SECTOR

a) Management of Essential Medicines and Health Supplies in Health Facilities

Section 4 of the Essential Medicines and Health Supplies Manual 2012 requires an effective stock management system which ensures that the right medicines of the right quality and quantities are available at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost. Furthermore, Section 4 of the National Medical Stores Act 1993 provides that one of the objectives is to secure, safe and efficient storage, administration, distribution and supply of the goods, having regard to national needs and to the special nature of the goods in question in accordance with the national drug policy and the national drug authority.

A review was undertaken of the supply, storage, administration and distribution of EMHS in National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities and I noted the following:

- Most of the hospitals and facilities had expired drugs which were kept in the stores instead of being returned to NMS for appropriate handling. In addition, NMS had Non Viable Stock of UGX.13.4Bn at the close of the Financial year representing an increment of Ugx.8.25Bn (160%) from 2020/2021. The expired drugs included ARVs, donated latex gloves that failed NDA tests and items which could not be ordered for and utilised during the covid- 19 lockdown.

- Most hospitals and specialized health facilities still experienced drug stock outs ranging from 9-360 days.

- The storage areas for drugs in most of the hospitals and specialized facilities were small and medicines were congested with some medicines on the floors instead of pallets and boxes leaning on walls. Some stores were not well lit and appropriately ventilated.











transporting and destroying them. Further, poor storage conditions for drugs may result into loss of potency or degradation of products that may harm patients.

I advised the Accounting Officers to liaise with the responsible stakeholders such as NMS, Ministry of Health, NDA, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and Development Partners to improve the management of EMHS at National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities.

b ) Understaffing in Health Facilities

National Regional Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities have staff structures that need to be adequately filled for efficient and effective service delivery. I however noted that the facilities had staffing gaps with the critical gaps being in the National Referral Hospitals that were recently elevated from Regional Referral status and specialized facilities (UCI and UHI) whose staff structures are yet to be approved by the Ministry of Public Service.

I also noted that for most of the facilities, funds for recruitment of staff were warranted and released in the last quarter of the financial year (May 2022). As a result, there was not enough time for Health Service Commission to recruit staff so that the facilities can absorb the funds. Funds were thus returned to the UCF.

Inadequate staffing results in heavy workloads and exploitation of existing staff, creates job- related stress which negatively affects the quality-of-service delivery to the community. I advised Management to follow up the recruitment funding for re-voting and ensure completion of recruitment exercise.

c) Utilization and Maintenance of Medical Equipment

According to Section 7 of Operation Manual for Regional Medical Equipment Maintenance Workshops and Medical Equipment Maintenance Guidelines, 2013, the entity should plan and budget for maintenance under two main categories of Planned Preventive Maintenance and Breakdown maintenance to ensure efficient maintenance of medical equipment.

I made an assessment of medical equipment in the National Referral Hospitals and specialized health facilities focusing on the functionality and availability of medical equipment and maintenance of the same. The results of my assessment are summarized below;

- The hospitals and specialized health facilities did not plan for preventive maintenance based on analyzed equipment data such as usage statistics and dates of previous maintenance. This led to persistent breakdown of equipment and prolonged down time which affected service delivery in terms of reliability and quality of health care.

- There were budget shortfalls for maintenance of equipment with some hospitals and facilities receiving less than 50% of the budget. As a result, a number of vital equipment were not appropriately maintained during the year.

- For Mulago National Referral Hospital I undertook a special audit which included among others the procurement and maintenance of medical equipment and noted various anomalies in the payments for maintenance of medical equipment. The details are included in separate audit report.











I advised the Accounting Officers to improve medical equipment maintenance planning and liaise with the relevant stakeholders including Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to secure adequate funding for maintenance and replacement of medical equipment.

d) Unresolved Contingent Liabilities

I reviewed the financial statements of Ministry of Health and noted that there was a sum of UGX.120,829,578,815 in respect of potential obligations/payables due to various organisations as at 30 th June 2022. Refer to the table below for details:

Table 66: Unresolved Contingent Liabilities Contingent liabilities Details Amount (UGX) Legal proceedings i. Spencon Services Ltd 45,656,660,072 ii. Family Care Hospital 550,000,000 Other Contingent iii. National Drug Authority – verification 43,210,405,917 liabilities fees, import fees and licenses iv. National Medical Stores – Storage and 31,412,512,826 distribution of drugs Total 120,829,578,815

Under the circumstances, settlement of the above potential obligations is likely to adversely affect future operations of the Ministry.

The Accounting Officer explained that the Ministry constituted a team comprising NDA, the MOH Pharmacy department, and MOH Internal Audit to verify and reconcile the above figures. The exercise was still ongoing.

I advised the Accounting Officer to fast track the reconciliation process. In addition, management should consider liaising with NMS and NDA to agree on a payment plan to settle the validated domestic arrears.

13.0. TRADE SECTOR

a) Payments outside the Work Plan

Paragraph 10.33.1 (d) of the Treasury Instructions 2017 requires additional internal controls relating to payments to be noted by each Accounting Officer and that all commitments should be consistent with the approved annual budget, and relate to activities in the annual work plan.











The Accounting Officer stated that these payments were made because the Ministry received additional funding to settle additional cooperatives via supplementary releases appropriated by Parliament for that purpose.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage Parliament and other stakeholders to streamline prioritization of cooperative compensations to ensure equitable allocation of resources and transparency.

b) Payments to Cooperatives through Third parties - Law Firms

Paragraph 10.6.1 of the Treasury Instructions 2017, states that in general, all Government payments processed through the Government Financial Management Information system (GFMIS) will be made by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to the beneficiary bank accounts. I reviewed the compensation process and payments made and noted the following:

- During the financial year, War claims compensation of UGX. 29.09 Bn was made to different persons and law firms but not directly to the beneficiary Cooperative societies for onward remittance to beneficiary Cooperative members. It was observed that, Cooperative compensations are not driven by Cooperative members. As a result, the process and resolutions pertaining to valuation of the claimed amounts attached to the lost properties during the war are not known by members.

- I noted that Cooperative Unions currently do not have constituted Boards, contrary to section 18A (1) of the Cooperative Societies Act 2020, that requires every society to have a Board consisting of an odd number of members not less than five and not exceeding nine.

- Furthermore, files relating to fifty-five (55) Cooperative Societies were not availed for audit; hence I could not confirm the authenticity of the compensation claims. The verification reports for only fifteen (15) cooperative societies were seen but these also did not have their specific files, hence posing a risk of having non-existing Cooperatives being compensated.

- Minutes to prove any agreement on the resolutions taken were not availed hence casting doubt on the authenticity of the transactions, member participation and physical existence of these Cooperatives leading to a risk that the bonafide beneficiaries may not have received the payment.

- Only the verification committee members signed the compensation claims report.

- Management paid excess amount of UGX .588.2 Mn above the planned (in regard to payments to Teso Cooperative Union - UGX.352.9Mn and North Bukedi Cooperative Union – UGX.235.2Mn). Similarly, UGX.6.17Bn that was earmarked to pay three Cooperative Unions; Masaba Cooperative Union (UGX.882.35 Mn), West Nile Growers Cooperative Union (UGX.882.35Mn) and Wamala Growers Cooperative Union (UGX.4.41Bn) but was not paid. Management attributed the overpayment to the availability of resources.











I further found the practice of payment through third parties both inconveniencing and exposing the Ministry to loss of public funds to non-bonafide members, given the lack of participation of members

The Accounting Officer explained that Cooperatives’ legal representatives, instructed the Ministry formally to pay compensations through third parties, adding that some of the files had been transferred to Entebbe for temporally storage, hence could thus not be readily availed to auditors.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that all Cooperative Unions are legally constituted, their existence verified and review the practice of making payments through third parties and pay directly to Cooperatives. Meanwhile, a follow up process to confirm that the payments reached the beneficiary Cooperatives should be initiated and the overpayments recovered.

c) Under absorption of funds in Uganda Development Corporation (UDC)

Section 45 (3) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 states that an Accounting Officer shall enter into an annual budget performance contract with the Secretary to the Treasury which shall bind the Accounting Officer to deliver on the activities in the work plan of the vote for a Financial year, submitted under Section 13 (15)” of the said Act. UDC receives appropriation through Vote 015.

It was established that overall, in addition to the unspent funds from the prior year of UGX.80.4 Bn, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48 as summarized below;

Table 67: Under absorption of funds in UDC Item Funds Funding Total Amount Variance brought received funds spent – UGX Bn forward during the available (UGX Bn) (UGX Bn) year (UGX Bn) Wage and 3.8 12.87 16.67 8.7 7.97 non-wage Development/ 76.6 150.35 226.95 24.44 202.5 projects Total 80.4 163.22 243.62 33.142 210.48











in relation to the other projects was due to the investment process that is followed to ensure viability and sustainability and has operated without a Board for the greater part of the year.

I advised the Executive Director to devise strategies for expediting the implementation of the projects to improve funds absorption.

d) Failure to seek approval for unspent balances

Section 17 (1) of the Public Finance Management Act 2015 states that “Every appropriation by Parliament shall expire and cease to have any effect at the close of the financial year for which it is made.” Sub Section (2) of the same section further requires the unspent money that was appropriated for the financial year, to be repaid to the Consolidated Fund at the close of the financial year.

Subsection (3) of the same section further states that a vote that repays money under subsection (2) shall revise its annual work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to take into account the unexpended money and the Minister responsible for the vote shall submit, as part of the budget for the preceding year, the revised work plan, procurement plan and recruitment plan to the Minister.

Uganda Development Corporation receives project funds that are appropriated under the Ministry of Trade Industry and Cooperatives. The funding caters for operations (wage and Non-wage) and specific projects. However, UDC has accumulated project funds of UGX. 80.4Bn since 30th June 2021. The funds in issue were not returned to the consolidated fund and neither was supplementary funding approval sought. This may be attributed to the accounting policies of the Corporation where all Government funds are capitalised.

Retention of un-spent balances without authority contravenes the PFMA and May lead to the diversion of funds resulting from accounting policies adopted.

The Executive Director explained that UDC was being funded in accordance with the UDC Act 2016 and that according to Section 24 of the Act, the Board is required to declare to the Minister any money of the Corporation that is not utilised at the end of each financial year and also allows the Corporation to invest any funds not immediately required for any purpose upon approval of the Board.

I advised the Executive Director to always ensure compliance with the PFMA regarding budget execution and seek appropriate authority to retain the funds. In addition, Management is advised to engage all stakeholders to change the funding model to allow all funds appropriated and remitted to the Corporation to be capitalised.











14.0. TOURISM SECTOR

a) Lack of a comprehensive plan for the management of the invasive species

According to Section 21(1-2) of the Uganda Wildlife Act 2019, The Board shall develop a conservation planning manual that takes cognizance of the national policies and development planning frameworks and the Executive Director shall, with the approval of the Board prepare and publish a comprehensive management plan for each wildlife protected area and wildlife management area, in accordance with the conservation planning manual.

During my review of the plans for the Authority, I was not availed with a conservation planning manual and a comprehensive management plan for each wildlife protected area and wildlife management area and I was unable to confirm whether there is a deliberate effort to manage the invasive and exotic plant species that cover an average of 30% of the surface areas of Queen Elizabeth, Lake Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks.

These invasive/exotic or endemic plants, amongst others, include different species such as Dichrostachys cinerea, Lantana Camara, Parthenium hysterophorus, Opuntia Vulgaris, Imperata cylindrica, Maeruade cumbens, Caesalepina decaputala, Acacia hockii, Tecoma Stan, Senna siamea and Thevetia peruviana.

I attributed this to the delayed decision by the Board and Management of UWA to determine the approach that can comprehensively deal with the invasive species.

The invasive species contract the grazing areas for herbivores animals and affect the rangeland and environmental quality that consequently reduce the wildlife population of grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda Kobs.

The Accounting Officer acknowledged the issue and informed me in his response that invasive plant management is a real challenge in the management of protected areas and that this needed more funds than UWA could allocate. He further explained that management had annually allocated funds for the eradication of the invasive species and so far 2000 hectares had been freed and are being maintained. He added in his response that a total of UGX.770Mn had been allocated to invasive management under UWA internally generated funds and another UGX.1.590Bn under World Bank (IFPA-CD project).

Additionally, he further explained that the funds allocated to the management of invasive included engaging a consultant to spearhead the development of the Invasive Species Management Strategy to be concluded before the close of this financial year 2022-2023 and the procurement of a consultant to develop a strategy for eradication of invasive species is at advertising stage.











Whereas all the ten (10) national parks were dually gazetted in accordance with the law, I noted that there were several ongoing cases of claims on land in the gazetted areas under the management of Uganda Wildlife Authority as evidenced by active court cases in some parks namely Lake Mburo National Park, Mt. Elgon National Park, Semiliki National Park and Matheniko Bokora. This was attributed to increased encroachment on the National parkland.

Failure to resolve these cases may lead to the loss of gazetted land areas that will affect wildlife conservation.

The Accounting Officer explained in his response that prior to the creation of Uganda National Parks and later Uganda Wildlife Authority; the protected areas mentioned above were being managed under the Forest and Game Departments of Government. These two Departments were ill-facilitated by Government and therefore had no funds to enforce the protection of the said areas and this resulted in a number of encroachments. When UWA took over management, a number of efforts have been made to resolve these conflicts, most of which are in court. UWA has no jurisdiction over the Courts of Law and is therefore incapacitated to have the court cases fast-tracked.

He further explained that the Authority engaged the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities and the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development which led to the cancellation of some of the erroneously issued titles; the process of cancellation of others is still ongoing. Additionally, the Accounting Officer informed that the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities is already engaging the Ministry of Lands on the matter.

I advised the Accounting Officer to closely monitor illegal encroachments in the gazetted areas and take appropriate actions to resolve these claims.

15. CROSS CUTTING ISSUES IN SCHOOLS

I undertook financial audit of Secondary schools and Tertiary Institutions for the financial year ending 30 th December 2020 and 30 th June 2020 respectively and observed the following key findings that are also included in individual entity reports.

i. A review of Approved budget estimates of 207 schools revealed that they budgeted to receive UGX.390,261,047,176 but only realised UGX.209,516,751,825 leading to an underfunding of UGX.180,744,295,351 (46%). Failure to realise all budgeted amounts affected implementation of several school activities.

ii. 16 schools did not prepare financial statements for the year under review. Failure to prepare financial statements hinders effective oversight over expenditure, revenue, assets and liabilities of the school. iii. Receivables of UGX.21,094,320,460 had accumulated in 117 schools by the end of the financial year. Receivables represent an idle asset, since it denied schools the revenue required to implement planned activities.











vii. 55 schools did not have strategic plans to guide them in planning for achievement of short term, medium term and long-term goals. Non-existence of the school strategic plan affects effective planning and budgeting in the short term and long term.

viii. 49 schools did not have procurement plans to guide the procurement processes executed during the year. Lack of a procurement plan could result into diversion of funds to non- critical procurements not initially intended to be executed.

B. CROSS CUTTING ISSUES IN LLGs

I sampled 335 LLGs for audit in the financial year of 2020/2021. I reviewed the funding for the year and noted that the LLGs had budgeted to receive UGX.138,533,294,237, but only received UGX.112,296,656,986 (81%) which led to a shortfall of UGX.26,236,637,251 (19%).

A review of the implementation of the planned activities in the LLGs revealed the following;

i. 325 of the audited LLGs had unqualified opinions, 8 of them had qualified opinions and 2 were issued with disclaimers.

ii. They budgeted to collect local revenue of UGX.41,936,664,586, but only collected UGX.29,999,490,158 (71.5%) which resulted into a shortfall of UGX.11,937,174,428 (28.5%). Shortfalls in local revenue collections negatively affect the implementation of planned activities which frustrates service delivery.

iii. Only 2,928 posts were filled out of 7792 approved staff posts. Understaffing overstretches the available staff beyond their capacity, creates job-related stress to the fewer staff and negatively affects the level of public service delivery to the community.

iv. I noted that 140 LLGs lacked title deeds for 632 plots of land. This implies that the land is exposed to a risk of encroachment and land disputes.

v. Out of the 335 LLGs sampled, only 28 had strategic plans in place and the remaining 307 did not have. There is a risk that the budgets prepared and activities implemented during the financial year were not aligned to the NDP- III which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives.











Lower Local Councils in the implementation of Government programs which affects service delivery at the grass roots.

x. 6 LLGs failed to account for UGX.459,463,633 in the FY 2020/2021 and therefore I was unable to confirm that the funds were used for the intended purpose.

xi. 16 LLGs spent UGX.200,229,143 in excess of the required amount on council allowances. There is a risk that funds meant for implementation of planned activities was diverted and used to pay Council emoluments.











PART 4: INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, VALUE FOR MONEY AND SPECIAL AUDITS

During the financial year 2020/2021, I undertook three Information Systems audits, three Engineering audits covering 90 projects, eight Value for money audits. In addition, I undertook special and forensic audits which are reported on separately.

Below is a summary of the key findings I noted in each category, the details of which are included in individual reports issued separately.

4.1. KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ENGINEERING AUDITS

4.1.1. Audit of GRID Extension Projects implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency Currently under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for the period 2009 – 2017

Between 2009 and 2017, REA secured over USD.80Million from SIDA, JICA, World Bank, NORAD and the Government of Uganda to implement priority Rural Electrification Projects most of which were part of the sample of projects under review.

The Scope of the audit covered the GRID extension power line projects implemented in the 13 service territories under the various funding programs between the financial years 2013/14 to 2017/18.

The scope of the GRID Extension power-line projects assessment was the following;

i. Completed Grid Projects Implemented by REA since Financial Year 2013/2014 to 2016/17 when RESP II was being implemented

ii. Completed UMEME Cost Shared Lines since 2013/2014 and 2014/15.

iii. Schemes Implemented through Concession Operators

- Kilembe Mines Ltd
- Ferdsult Engineering Servcies Ltd 

Wenrenco 

UEDCL iv. Ongoing Grid Projects under Implementation by REA











Urbanization of several trading centres has taken place along the power lines constructed, many income-generating activities were initiated by the locals such as maize milling, wielding, salons, juice production thus improving their incomes and way of life and creation of employment opportunities; promoting value addition to the local agricultural products and dairy products; reduction in greenhouse emissions; improving investment climate in targeted communities; and increase in government revenue.

However, there are still some performance gaps in operation of rural electrification projects that need to be addressed as follows;

i. Audit carried out creditor circularization to determine any outstanding amounts owed to Contractors, Consultants and Concessioners and noted that, REA owed nine (9) firms for works already completed worth USD.28,080,776.53 and UGX.3,350,908,860.

ii. Out of the commissioned lines, UMEME attracted and obtained O&M rights for about 25% and these were largely township lines. UEDCL obtained about 60% of the O&M rights leaving the 15% to the other operators, however audit did not get evidence of any deliberate O&M policies or practices largely on the preventative maintenance. The auditors were not provided with preventative maintenance plans, nor was there proof of a structured and consistence implementation of basic prudent maintenance practices on the lines. Although ERA is mandated to issue license to the operators, review and approve the O&M Budgets as well as regulate the operations of these licensee, audit noted minimal supervision by ERA in line with oversight monitoring and Evaluation.

iii. Additionally, in terms of the operating and management costs of power lines, they were deemed high due to a number of factors such as transformers, defective or rotten poles which needed replacement in the shortest of time after the commissioning of these lines. For instance, according to UEDCL data for Kabale – Kisoro – Bunagana Scheme, the annual maintenance cost was at UGX.34.7 billion against UGX.518 billion generated revenues. This translates 6.8% of revenue which is above the 5% threshold requirement.

iv. There are several occupation and safety hazards noted during implementation of the GRID power projects. 33kV power lines were constructed to span across roofs of residential houses in Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere power scheme, Mpanga- Kamwenge-Kahungye-Nkingo.











decrease in the safety and performance of the network as well as reduced expected lifetime of the equipment.

vii. In line with contractual requirements, wooden poles are expected to last up to 20years. Document review and field inspections noted that poles supplied on some projects as; Masindi- Waki-Buliisa, Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere, Gulu-Acholibur, Kitgum-Palabek, Ayer-Kamdini among others, failed due to rotting, insect Infestation, pole burning and breaking. No document was availed to ascertain that quality control procedures were followed. Furthermore, no effort was recognized from REA that the defective wooden poles are claimed back from the respective pole suppliers.

I have made the following recommendations to the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) which has now inherited the functions of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under which the GRID power projects were implemented and recommended that;

a. The outstanding amounts owed to contractor’s firms are paid for works that are completed and verified to avoid incurring penalties on delayed payments.

b. To continuously address Environmental and social issues in contracts and their implementation and ensure that all contracts for implementation of GRID power projects make it mandatory for the implementation firms to prepare environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) reports in addition to resultant Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement Action Management Plans (RAMPs).

c. Expedite the process of compensating all PAPs taking into consideration the time lag for the delayed payment (9 years since existing assessment was conducted) accordingly, Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) studies should be conducted based on the final designs, where changes are deemed inevitable in the optimal design, such changes should be communicated such that revaluations of new PAPs are conducted.

d. Establish causes of failing wooden poles even after quality tests have been undertaken. The option to use Concrete Poles can also be considered especially given that the quality control during manufacture for concrete poles can easily be monitored and controlled unlike wooden poles whose quality is determined by many factors from the time they are planted, harvested, treated at the factory, and eventually transported to site.

- The licensed firms operating under concession agreements undertake effective operation and maintenance activities in respect of replacing all











non-function GRID equipment as blown fuses, surge arrestors, replacing broken poles, faulty transformers to keep the power lines functional

- MEMD closely monitors and supervises the licensees to establish that they comply with the license terms and conditions and fulfil the objective of increasing access to electricity.

A) Technical Engineering Audit of 39 Selected UNRA Road Development and Rehabilitation Projects implemented during financial year 2021/2022

During the financial year 2021/22, a total of 39 projects (Development, rehabilitation and bridge projects) with a total contract sum/value of UGX.8.49Tn were under implementation by UNRA. A sample of nine (9) projects (development and rehabilitation projects) with a contract sum/value of UGX. 1.86Tn (21.87%) were selected for audit and the following observations made;

i. Delayed provision of access to project sites resulting in a Loss of UGX.5.64Bn

A loss of UGX. 5.64Bn was incurred as a result of failure to access land for road project sites in 6 road projects, this arose from delayed compensation of Project affected Persons (PAPs) for acquisition of land for right of way resulting in the contractors charging UNRA for time related obligations due to failure to access project site and charging UNRA for idle time.

In 6 of the 9 UNRA road projects, access to sites was not achieved as required by the different contract arrangements. This was the case especially where the contracts required the employer to handover a minimum of 30% of the land required for permanent works within 3 months of the commencement and the balance within 12 months. There was no timely access to sites, which resulted in multiple extensions of time and in some instances costs relating to the time obligations. The delays were noted on the following projects;

a. Tirinyi –Pallisa-Kumi where delays led to payment of UGX. 4.56Bn for time related obligations b. Pallisa - Kamonkoli where access delays led to payment of UGX. 1.08Bn for time related obligations c. For Kapchorwa - Suam project where the access to site delayed from 21 days to 441 days from Km 42 to Km 73. d. Rukungiri-Kihihi/Ishasha where a delay of 70 days was initially experienced and later increased due to non-compensation of project affected persons. e. Kampala Northern By-pass where access was achieved 5 years into implementation

No. of months delayed 31 months 24 months 16 months. 6 months

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the consultant submits required deliverables within contractual timelines. The UNRA project management team should be held responsible for delays without appropriate justification.

iii. Interest charges of UGX.1.82Bn on delayed payment of Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs) to the Contractors

I established that payments of interim payment certificates to the contractors for eight projects were not on time. Delays in payments of IPCs may lead to interest payments and affect the contractor’s cash flows in project execution. The following delays were noted on projects and determination of certificates;

a. For Kapchorwa - Suam project, delays on all IPCs up to IPC No. 7 resulting in an interest payment of UGX.1.08Bn. b. For Tirinyi – Pallisa - Kumi, IPCs 1 to 6 were delayed resulting in a certified interest of UGX.0.45Bn. c. Pallisa - Kamonkoli, delays were observed on IPCs 1 to 7 resulting in a certified interest of UGX.0.28Bn. d. Mpigi town roads, all payments to the contractor were delayed between 28 and 242 days e. Namunsi – Sironko – Muyembe - Kapchorwa (Phase II), delays on IPCs 5 to 9 ranging from 4 days and over 7 months. f. Kitala - Gerenge project, delays in payments to suppliers in June 2021 g. Rukungiri – Kihihi - Ishasha/Kanungu, delays in payments on IPCs 1-15 ranging from 8 to 142 days. h. For Kampala Northern Bypass, payments were delayed and interest paid in Addendum No.3 for all payments up to June 2020.

The Accounting Officer attributed delays to reductions in MTEF allocations resulting in funding shortages.











Table 69: Project overpayments S/No Contract/Project name Overpayment (UGX) 1 Kapchorwa-Suam 20,594,809.19 2 Tirinyi-Pallisa-Kumi 0 3 Pallisa-Kamonkoli 0 4 Mpigi Town Roads (20km 126,896,449.94 5 Kigumba-Bulima 49,129,125 6 Namunsi – Sironko – Muyembe Kasalem 6,168,276 (PHASE II) 7 Kitala-Gerenge (in-house construction) 0 8 Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu 29,081,818 TOTAL (UGX) 231,870,478.13 9 Kampala Northern Bypass II (Capacity EUR 47,469.01 Improvement)

I advised the Accounting Officer to recover all the overpayments and institute measures to prevent overpayments.

v. Unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor

I observed unjustified application of foreign currency correction factor which can lead to overpayments if unaddressed. This was established on the following projects;

a. Kapchorwa - Suam project where the foreign currency exchange rates were being applied without justification which might lead to computation errors in price adjustment certificates. b.

Tirinyi – Pallisa - Kumi where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX 3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX 3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of UGX.54.84Mn. c.

Pallisa - Kamonkoli where use of an erroneous exchange rate of 31 st May 2016 (of UGX 3369.52) instead of 30 th May 2016 (of UGX 3370.52) resulted into an overpayment of UGX.40.05Mn.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure payments are made as per contract terms and the right rates are adopted for payments to prevent any financial loss.











vii. Irregular advancement of UGX.2.32Bn to the Contractor relating to materials on site

UGX.2.32Bn was advanced to the contractor in payment certificates (01 to 07) relating to materials on site for the Mpigi town roads project without any contractual basis.

The Accounting Officer responded that the materials-on-site value was paid in split currency as per the main road contract. I indicated to the Accounting Officer that the contract signed for the works in 2019 did not have any provision for payments of materials-on-site. The main contract being referenced did not form any part of the contract documents as listed in the contract agreement.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that the funds are recovered from the subsequent payments.

B) Value for Money Technical/Engineering Audit of Twenty Infrastructure Projects Implemented by Ministry Of Education And Sports Under The Uganda Skills Development Program (USDP)

The Uganda Skills Development Project (USDP) is a five-year World Bank funded project with a development objective of enhancing the capacity of institutions to deliver high quality demand-driven training courses in three priority sectors (agriculture, construction and manufacturing). In line with the objectives of the project, the Ministry of Education is undertaking building infrastructural works in twenty (20) technical institutes.

During the financial year 2021/22, I under took a Value for Money Technical- Engineering audit of Twenty (20) infrastructure projects of the Uganda Skills Development Programme (USDP) worth UGX. 108.47Bn implemented by Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES).

i.

Procurement of the USDP Infrastructure Projects

I reviewed procurement documentation for the 20 USDP Projects and noted the following;











d. The contracts for the works contractors in Kalango and Ora, and Kitgum Technical Institutes, were awarded to the second and the fifth best evaluated bidders respectively without justification.

I advised the Accounting Officer of MoES to ensure strict compliance with PPDA rules and regulations and World Bank Guidelines on procurement of World Bank funded projects.

ii. Design Omissions

I reviewed the design reports and drawings of eighteen (18) contracts that were prepared by the design consultant and noted a number of omissions some of which were later on introduced as variations during implementation of the construction works.

The omissions included; anti-sag rods and wind bracing members in the steel roof trusses, considerations for rain water harvesting options, retaining walls, generator houses, tank drawings, internal floor drains and storm water designs.

I advised the Accounting Officer to always ensure that designs prepared by consultants are thoroughly reviewed to ensure that they adequately consider all aspects required.

iii.

Delayed Completion of Works

I noted delays in completion of the works on ten (10) contracts ranging from 15 to 330 days. Resulting from these delays were liquidated damages totalling UGX.3.77Bn that were not charged from the contractors as per contract terms. The table below refers;

Table 70: Unclaimed liquidated damages S/No Contract Delays Uncharged (days) Liquidated Damages

Non-renewal of the guarantees may lead to failure to recover the advances paid in the event the contractors fail to complete execution of the construction works.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage contractors and secure additional advance guarantees and recover the advances otherwise, the advances should be fully recovered on the subsequent payments.

v. Irregular Payments

I noted that various payments across the 20 contracts were irregular due to the absence of documents supporting these payments, duplicate payments and payments for unexecuted works totaling UGX. 1.95Bn.

I advised the Accounting Officer to conduct further review of these payments and take appropriate action.

vi. Quantity Verifications

I undertook an analysis of the drawings in the contract documents availed and also undertook measurements on some of the executed work items to establish the consistency with which the supervision team accurately measured the quantities before payments. I noted inconsistencies in some of the quantities certified across all the 20 contracts resulting in overpayments equivalent to UGX.1.71Bn from the different projects as shown in the table below;











S/No Contract Overpayment (UGX)			
15	UTC Elgon Lot 1	23,112,847	
16 UTC Elgon Lot 2 21,469,465

19	Kasodo Technical Institute	125,683,060	
20 Rwentanga Technical Institute 33,199,300			
TOTAL		1,709,528,745	




I advised the Accounting Officer to undertake further re-measurement of all the works and ensure recovery of the overpaid amounts before preparation of Final Accounts and closure of the aforementioned projects.

vii.

Supervision of the Works

I noted that the Ministry did not use supervision firms procured and opted to supervise all the twenty (20) sites in-house. Whereas the supervising firm was expected to have four (4) Senior Civil Engineers/Architects, 4 Architects, 4 Quantity Surveyors, 4 Environmentalists and 4 Structural Engineers for all the 20 sites, I noted that at the time of audit, the Ministry only had 2 Senior Civil Engineers, 1 architect, 1 Quantity Surveyor, 1 Environmentalist and 1 structural Engineer for all the 20 sites.

However, the supervisions were undertaken by the ministry yet they had limited capacity to undertake effective supervision.

I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure that future projects are adequately supervised with appropriate specialist.

4.2. REDACTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS AUDIT REPORTS

In accordance with Sections 13 and 22 of the National Audit Act (NAA) 2008, I am mandated to audit all the government investments and carry out special audit engagements that include information technology (IT) Audits. Accordingly, I planned and executed my audits following ISSAI 200: Fundamental Principles of Public-Sector Auditing and INTOSAI 5100 guidance.

I conducted four (4) audits namely; National Security Information System (NSIS) at NIRA; Programme Budgeting System (PBS) at MOFPED, and Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) at (MoWT). Below are redacted versions of my key findings.











The system provides centralized approval and citizenship verification to the point of secure personalization and issuance of biometric and machine-readable National Identification Documents. The major functionality of the NSIS is to reliably identify Ugandan citizens and alien residents.

I undertook an information systems audit of NSIS to establish whether the necessary general, application and specific controls were implemented and consistently applied. Below are the redacted findings which exclude sensitive application and database control weaknesses;

i. Absence of active interfaces between NSIS and other systems

The NSIS did not have active interfaces with other Government key systems such as URA’s E-Tax systems that process data relating to Government Non-Tax Revenue (NTR) generated from services offered by NIRA, IFMS and IPPS/HCMS which process Government critical information related to civil servants and other Government suppliers, including the banking sector.

Furthermore, the sharing of information among NIRA internal systems was not automated. For example, in registering childbirth for the birth certificate, the registration officer re-keys the child and parent’s information into the BDAR system yet the same information is resident in NSIS.

Lack of proper interfaces with the other critical systems hinders Government effectiveness and efficiency in providing services and may lead to multiple inconsistent information in different systems and delayed delivery of services since procedures are repetitive.

Management explained that interfaces were not done because the system (NSIS) was vendor locked.

NIRA should engage NITA-U and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MoICT) to ensure that all other MDAs and the private sector which rely on its information design strategies to enable interfaces or appropriate integrations with requisite protocols to mitigate misuse of data.

- The integration with the various systems was not implemented.
- The Intellectual Property Rights (SCC 15) were not mentioned in the contract documents, creating challenges in the transfer of the system ownership, or transfer of source code.
- Generally, there were delays in the contract implementation as per the project implementation reports, as result, contract deliverables worth EUROS 421,934.80 were NOT implemented as summarized in the table below;

I further noted that the implementation contract had expired in 2012. Subsequently, a Support and Maintenance contract was signed had also been terminated and the vendor had left the site by the time of the audit.

This may be attributed to the lack of a contract manager/management team as required by Section 52 (1) of the PPDA (contracts) Regulations 2014.

Management explained that the contract was signed between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Muehlbauer ID services GmbH in 2010, but implemented in 2014 following the Cabinet approval of the project team consisting of a policy committee comprising of Ministers chaired by the Prime Minister, a Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Internal Affairs/Projector Coordinator, and Project Implementation Team chaired by a Project Manager.

The system was built and was able to deliver the objectives of the project i.e., registration of citizens (16+ years) and achieved over 90% of the targets. This led to the enactment of ROPA 2015 and the establishment of NIRA to consolidate the achievements of the project.

Subsequently, with the establishment of NIRA, all contracts were assigned, Contract Managers.

I advised the Accounting Officer to always streamline the management of the projects, by timely appointing the contract management team in accordance with PPDA regulations and industry best practices to facilitate effective project management. In addition, the Accounting Officer should explore ways of recovering costs relating to unimplemented deliverables.

- There was no alignment of key ICT business functions/units in the authority. For instance, the birth and death systems were not integrated with the registration systems, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiency in the utilisation of data.

- A number of IT policies were still in draft form for about three years due to the lack of an IT steering committee.











The above was attributed to a lack of appropriate IT governance structures in the Authority.

Management indicated that it had concluded policy drafting, awaiting Board approval and shall make sure they are in place before the end of FY 2022/23. The IT steering/strategy committee shall as well be constituted by the end of the first quarter of FY 2022/23.

I advised the Accounting Officer to engage all stakeholders and institute appropriate Governance structures to foster the management of IT to effectively deliver its mandate.

iv. Absence of IT governance policies and strategy

NIRA did not have IT governance policies and guides such as;

- IT Strategic Plan
- IT risk assessment/management policy
- IT security policy

As a result, IT planning is performed on a reactionary ad-hoc basis and no IT Risk Assessment is carried out. Furthermore, the NIRA Board had not approved a security policy.

Given the dynamic nature of the IT environment, risks emerge continuously, and some may culminate into disastrous outcomes if left unchecked.

Management explained that NIRA IT-related policies were awaiting Board approval and shall ensure all are in place by the end of FY 2022/23.

I advised Management to fast-track the approval of the policies and strategy, as well as institute mechanisms to timely update and implement them.

v. IT continuity plans/disaster recovery plan

NIRA undertakes regular backup of data on backup tapes but comprehensive testing of the procedures for backed-up data recovery had not been conducted to establish the effectiveness of data recovery. In addition, the Authority did not have a Disaster Recovery Plan in place as required by industry practice.











vi. Overlapping/conflicting roles on NIRA systems

A review of the system user roles and responsibilities revealed that some system users at NIRA hold conflicting roles. I noted one user having responsibilities for Application and Database Administration. In addition, Assistant Registration Officers at districts were performing IT Officer roles on the system.

There is a high likelihood of data fraud and theft without being detected by Management, arising out of misuse of conflicting/overlapping user responsibilities. Management explained that due to insufficient staffing numbers, officers were doing more roles and activities. Structure changes can only be expected after the Ministry of Public Service RAPEX exercise.

I advised Management to ensure that the roles of users are adequately segregated and documented to ensure that no single user starts and completes a transaction on their own.

vii. Lack of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between NIRA and various system vendors

There were no SLAs between NIRA with the various providers of the critical systems used within the organization such as; the National Security and Identification System (NSIS), the Mobile Vital Records System (MVRS) and the Birth Death Adoption and Registration system (BDAR) system.

Without the SLAs, it is hard to measure and verify vendor performance in providing services, such as; service availability, defect rates, technical quality, security and business results, among others. In addition, it should specify the remedies in case of non-compliance with service-level standards.

Management explained that at the time of the Audit, NIRA did not have SLAs in place but had since entered into contracts for software support and maintenance for the NSIS and MVRS systems.

I advised Management to negotiate and monitor SLAs with the respective vendors to ensure reliability and uninterrupted service delivery.











a) Lack of a strategy for transition from M/S Muehlbauer ID Services Gmbh NSIS to the USPC NSIS

There was no formal strategy or transition plans from Muehlbauer ID Services GmbH to Uganda Security Printing Company in particular regard to; scope, migration design, data migration (process flow data and processed and stored data, biometric data) testing design, recruitment of new staff, organizational support, assessment of existing equipment/technologies and compatibility.

Management explained that a transition strategy including a data migration plan was being finalized with USPC.

b) Departure from the provisions of the Joint venture Agreement

I reviewed the Joint Venture Agreement between Uganda Printing & Publishing Corporation, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Office of the President and the consortium of Veridos GmbH and Giesecke & Devrient GmbH stipulates the obligations of the Uganda Security Printing Company that includes:

- The establishment of modern paper-based security printing and card production lines,

- Demolishing and constructing new buildings at Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation (UPPC) suitable to house machinery for printing and support quality security printing works,

- Installation of modern machines/equipment to run and manage high-quality security print services for the documents that were previously printed by UUPPC and other security documents as shall be agreed,

- Ensure that consumables needed for the manufacture are available at the best prices,

- Establishment of an efficient and appropriate IT infrastructure and equipment that can enable effective delivery and usage of security documents in Uganda.

- Supporting systems, the e-passport system, including IT systems and equipment that can enable effective and efficient delivery and application of security documents in the country. This also includes service and maintenance of the systems.

- Ensure compatibility of technologies
- The consortium shall ensure that technologies supplied to the company are capable of integration with other third-party systems and in every way support the delivery of services or products under this agreement.

- In case technologies are incapable of integration, the parties shall provide the necessary means of acquiring data /information from existing systems.











The National Security Information system is made up of two major interfacing systems;

 SDMS (Secure Document Management System)-

This system is responsible for enrolment and registration and contains manages the database and the life cycle of all applicants and monitors any changes, additions and death of a citizen. SDMS has four sub-modules;

- GET ID -This is the enrolment solution responsible for enrolment, card issuance, replacement and change of particulars
- DEOS (District Enrolment Offline/Online system)-this system/module of the NSIS has two instances;
- DEOS Site-This aggregates different kits attached to a particular district/station
- DEOS Central-this aggregates data from different stations/districts on the central server
- FRS (Fingerprint recognition system)
- AFIS (automatic Face Recognition system)

 INCAPE (Integrated Card Personalization)

This is the system/software responsible for the printing and production of the national identity cards

Contrary to the provisions of the Joint Venture, USPC has been expanded to include;

- Supply both the enrolment registration system to replace the Secure Document Management system (SDMS) that is responsible for enrolment, Registration, Fingerprint capture, Face recognition and card issuance.

- The system responsible for national identity card production -INCAPE, rather than the supply of only the system that supports printing and production of National identity cards (INCAPE) as provided for in the Joint Venture.











- Clause 18.1 states that the territory of the company is the national territory of Uganda unless otherwise mutually agreed by shareholders. The company shall have exclusive rights to provide products and services under the Joint Venture Agreement.

- Clause 20.2 states that except for the e-passport system and National ID card project, the company shall be given first priority to locally manufactured goods and locally provided services which meet the technical specifications, quality standards and economic viability defined by the company.

For the e-passport and National ID card project and where goods manufactured or services provided in Uganda do not meet technical specifications, including quality, quantity, the timeline for delivery and economic viability required by the company, the company shall procure such goods through the consortium as a supplier. Specifically, the consortium shall;

- Be the exclusive supplier to the company of raw materials and semi-finished products manufactured by the consortium.
- Be the preferred supplier to the company of materials not manufactured by the company.
- The consortium shall for the duration of this agreement.
- Be the exclusive supplier to the company of machinery manufactured by the consortium.
- Be the preferred supplier of machinery for the factory not manufactured by the consortium.

In light of the above, the Consortium shall be the sole supplier for 15 years – which exposes the country to the risk of contract locking and manipulation arising from monopoly.

In addition, the Government of Uganda represented by Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation, Office of the President and Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development shall have no input in the supply of raw materials and machinery which annuls the provisions of the Public Procurement and Disposal of assets.











The transition from Muelhbauer to Uganda Security Printing Company is hinged on the joint agreement between the Government of Uganda and the consortium simply implies a change from one vendor locked-in system to another, together with the corresponding disadvantages amongst which are the following;

a) Loss of the ability to negotiate prices b) Vulnerability to unsolicited/forced upgrades c) Significant costs of conversion of data to a format useable by USPC systems d) Significant costs in migration of data to the new systems and ultimately corruption and loss of critical data during conversion. e) Complete decommissioning of Muehlbauer software and hardware that was acquired at hefty prices. These include enrolment kits, computers, personalization machines, quality control scanners, blank polycarbonate national identity cards, servers etc. f) The transfer of system ownership and handover of source code after 15 years was not clear.

I advised Management to consider engaging the Attorney General to review the Joint Venture Agreement and address the aforementioned risks in line with industry standards.

ix. Basis/Justification for the transition from the M/S Muehlbauer to Uganda Securities Printing Company

Project initiation is a key stage of system development during which the initial concept is prepared, and the business case is developed. It entails the user department justifying the need for a new system and its intended benefits to the organization, defining the scope of the project, establishing available options, rating the criticality of the need, highlighting the project team and preparation of a budget for the project among other related issues.

A review of the ongoing transition between the NSIS supplied by Muehlbauer to the National Identity Card system supplied by the Uganda security Information system revealed that the required standard processes were not adequately followed. For instance, no formal and well-documented business case to justify the need for decommissioning of the NSIS was conducted.











x. Gaps in the ID registration process

Despite heavy investments in ICT solutions, the ID registration process is still manual, where application or registration cannot take place without a manual file. There are unnecessary delays in the transfer of information from the registration kit to the server; the filled data is uploaded onto the server at the end of the day if not week depending on the availability of the Information Technology Officer (ITO) /District Registration Officer (DRO); sometimes, it will require for an ITO from the neighbouring district to do the upload before getting to the central server for processing.

The upload of a filled application to the central server is done using a flash disk, which is prone to theft and errors at the enrolment and processing/ decoding using the manual server upload. Over 10,806,384 IDs had not been processed, especially the IDs that require verification by the committee and over 13,650,427 million IDs had not been picked/issued by clients, some date as far back as 2014. It should be noted that all the IDs are due to expire in 2025.

The stated gaps have led to extended delays in processing NIDs, which are likely to prevent the Authority from delivering its mandate. In addition, undelivered cards may expire before issuance.

Management acknowledged that it was true that the current system was offline between the kit and the district server, and it was because at the time of acquisition of the current NSIS system connectivity infrastructure in Uganda had a limitation.

I advised Management to consider automating citizen registration processes during the implementation of the new system and fast-track issuance of the cards.

xi. Lack of a proper inventory management system

I reviewed the National ID inventory system and noted the following;

- No formal documented process of tracking the movement of stock/ blank cards
- Non-existent validation of incoming inventory from the storage to establish accurate stock counts as blank cards are replenished.
- Failure to streamline the put-away, picking, packing, and shipping to prevent misplacements and lost stock.
- Lack of a physical verifiable record of the cards designated for destruction.











a) Ad hoc Access and Use of Information

There were no approved guidelines by the Board for Access and Use of Information NIRA as required by Regulations 3(7) and Regulation 6(2) of the Registration of Persons (Access and Use of Information) Regulations, 2015 setting out the access protocols and levels for persons, Ministries, Departments or Agencies of Government

b) Irregular access and use of NIRA Information service without a valid Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

Out of the sixty-seven entities that are connected and share citizenry NSIS data, only twenty-six agencies had MoUs with NIRA while forty-one did not have any.

c) Revenue loss due to Laxity in the enforcement of third-party obligations relating to the usage of data

I noted a significant variance of UGX.5,350,144,980 between the amount that was due to NIRA and actual collections from those agencies using NIRA NSIS data Failure to develop guidelines for information access hinders appraisal of the process and procedures for compliance purposes. In addition, in the absence of an MoU signed with these agencies, the National Register is at great risk of unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality and may also result in loss of NTR.

Management noted that the usage of data by all the agencies referred to had been exempted from paying fees by the Minister in accordance with the Registration of Persons Act, 2015. Management added that guidelines for access levels have been developed and submitted to Solicitor General for review.

I advised Management to ensure that all agencies with access to and using NIRA data have valid MoUs. In addition, Management should develop guidelines to ensure work complies with the requirements of the Regulations.

xiii. Failure by NIRA to execute its mandate on the registration of resident aliens











4.2.2. Information systems audit of the Programme Budgeting System (PBS) at the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MOFPED)

The Government of Uganda has been implementing reforms in the national budgeting system spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MOFPED). The budget system has evolved from the input budgeting approach, Output Oriented Budgeting (OOB) model and to outcome budgeting model to enhance effectiveness, accountability and transparency in Government. The OOB was first implemented using a standalone Output Budgeting Tool (OBT) system based on a Microsoft Access platform. The Ministry is currently implementing the Outcome Budgeting System based on NDP III outcomes.

The Standalone OBT Microsoft Access-based Platform had challenges, such as; Manual budget consolidation; Inability to perform comparability; inadequate automation of updates and upgrades; decentralised database management and absence of interfaces and integration with other systems.

In FY 2018/19, the Government implemented the Programme Based Budgeting System (PBB) to overcome the above challenges and strengthen the link between Government Strategic Objectives stated in the National Development Plan (NDP) II. The Programme Budgeting System (PBS) with a centralised database and application to perform budget preparations and reporting functions with effect FY 2017/18 to address the challenges paused by the OBT is being implemented. The PBS was rolled out to all MDAs including Missions and later, the Local Governments starting FY 2018/19.

The Specific objectives of the PBS include;

a) Ease and automate the consolidation of budget frameworks papers, estimates, and budget execution reports across MDAs; b) Automate exchange of data with other systems such as IFMS and IPPS; c) Provide access to historical budget data by users within MDAs and LGs; d) Enable central management and maintenance of the application; e) Improve security management by restricting user access appropriately and delineating roles and responsibilities on the system among users; f) Access from any point with an internet connection.











Consequently, the absence of a strategic plan for MoFPED ICT services led to;

a) Adhoc IT investment decisions b) Creating misalignment between IT initiatives and the Ministry's business strategy and priorities c) Frustrating monitoring of service levels and service improvement. d) Increased costs of ICT management. e) Duplication of systems and hiring similar Human Resources.

Management explained that the management of IT systems is based on individual departmental ICT plans. The Ministry is in the process of consolidating all ICT systems. Thereafter, will develop the IT Strategic Plan by the end of the first half of this Financial Year.

I advised Management to develop, adopt and implement a comprehensive strategy/strategic plan with the involvement of all stakeholders.

ii. Inappropriate Reporting Line for IT Contract Staff

The ICT structures of any organisation define employee hierarchy to ease coordination and decision-making in achieving the overall organisation objectives. Management through Resource Enhancement and Accountability Programme (REAP), recruited seven (7) IT, staff, with two-year renewable contracts to manage the PBS. The IT staff are categorised as IT Specialists, System Administrators and Systems Officers. A review of the structure and employee responsibilities revealed the following;

- The PBS IT staffs were limited to only supporting the Budget Directorate, rather than the entire Ministry.
- Some of the staff had specialised skills and expertise like application development and business process analysis that could be applied to support the PBS and other systems owned by the Ministry, however, updates of PBS are still outsourced.
- The said staff report to the Director Budget and Commissioner Budget Policy and Department Evaluation, contrary to the macro human resource structure of MoFPED which categorises them under Management of Information Systems.

I further noted that the IFMS IT staff also report to the Accountant General instead of reporting to the centralised ICT Structure Director MIS.











iii. Non-performance of IT risk assessment and management

Performance of IT risk assessment and management on a recurrent basis is critical for the successful implementation of IT solutions. The practice determines the likelihood and impact of identified risks and then designs responses to the risks identified, including the performance of a cost-benefit analysis and assigning responsibility for execution.

During the audit, I observed that risk assessment with regard to the implementation and utilization of PBS had not been performed. PBS shares information across other systems such as IFMS, and IPPS with different risk exposure and there are dependencies among critical business processes, applications and other integral information systems and IT infrastructure components that are subject to risk and vulnerabilities.

In addition, the IT environment is very dynamic and susceptible to vulnerabilities like cyber-attacks and disruptions which may lead to disaster and unavailability of services if the risks are not managed adequately in a proactive rather than reactive approach. This was attributed to the lack of a risk management strategy/policy that would be based on undertaking assessments.

Management explained that the PBS system is hosted on the IFMS infrastructure and its benefits from the IT security policy of the IFMS data centre. Equally, the Government of Uganda (G.O.U) Risk Management Strategy (2018) outlines Technological Risks as one of the categories of risks to address. Further, the PBS relies on support from NITA-U and Uganda Police Force which conduct periodic security and risk assessments.

In addition, the Ministry explained that it is in the process of implementing Enterprise Risk Management and it is expected that this will improve the way risks are identified and managed throughout the different departments of the Ministry.

I advised Management to review its current risk management strategy or develop a separate IT Risk Assessment/Management framework that will guide the proactive management of risk.











The lack of active participation in the internal audit function implies that there is no timely detection of errors and identification of risks.

Management indicated that the Ministry has a Forensics, & Risk advisory department, which is in the process of developing the Enterprise Risk Management Frame Work, for the entire government, the IT systems inclusive.

Furthermore, management explained that the IT & Performance Department has a core team that was trained in IT audit and rolled out a plan to audit all systems in government including the PBS. Internal audit staff will be made users on the PBS, as recommended.

I await the outcome of the Accounting Officer’s actions.

v. Non-testing of the Data Backup

Backup tests are conducted to verify the completeness and precision of the backup, appraise and evaluate the staff's capability to restore the backup and coordinate the recovery response process.

Whereas PBS backups were being undertaken at MoFPED, the backups were not being tested and documented to confirm the completeness and ability of staff to undertake recovery procedures should an adverse disruptive event occur.

It may result in loss of data and uncoordinated disaster response in the event of disruptions.

Management explained that regular backup tests are carried out and they are now documented.

I advised Management to design procedures to undertake periodic recovery tests from backups and address any outcome of non-recovery of backed-up data.

vi. Inadequate internal capacity to operate the system

- During support, when a complaint is raised by a system user, it is handled by the first level of support which is the Business and functional team in the Budget Policy and Evaluation Department (BPED).











- On ascertaining that the issue is not user-related or due to data entry mistakes, it is referred to the PBS in-house IT team for assessment.
- It is only issues that cannot be resolved at that level that is forwarded to the PBS consultants for further action. Minor issues are resolved within two (2) hours while major issues are fixed within 24 hours.
- Training of the in-house team is an ongoing process despite the continuous upgrades. The Ministry is currently rolling out capacity-building programmes.
- With the stabilization of the system, the Internal IT team will be in a position to fully take over maintenance and development activities with minimal support from the consultants.

I advised Management to enhance internal capacity through knowledge transfer to local staff to ensure self-reliance and reduce the costs of system maintenance.

vii. Failure to comprehensively utilize Quality Assurance Services

Quality Assurance services review results and deliverables within the different phases of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and confirm compliance with the system requirements, advise on deviations and recommend process improvements.

I noted that the Ministry did not engage independent quality assurance services during the implementation of the system. The review of the contract management file for the EPBS revealed that the vendor would present to management the status of the project and the Annual Technical Support without the Ministry's independent verification of the quality of the deliverables.

I was not availed with reports covering quality assurance for key deliverables of the project such as data migration, system integration, stress and functional testing, user acceptance testing, and detailed go-live, among others.

The absence of independent quality assurance exposes the entity to risks of multiple escalations of support, delayed project completion and the system may not meet its functional and systems requirements.

Management indicated that the Ministry works in consultation with the Ministry of ICT, NITA (U), the Uganda Police ICT Directorate, and other MDAs to conduct the user acceptance exercise, upon which the reports are approved. However, that notwithstanding, Management shall implement the Auditor General’s recommendation of acquiring quality assurance services in future projects. I advised management to ensure that a comprehensive quality assurance process is undertaken during project implementation to enhance compliance with system development.











systems incidental to PBS such as the IBP among others. The interfaces support transactions using data exchange and integration with Government systems.

GoU through NITA-U implemented a data integration platform, the Ug-Hub, to automatically and securely exchange data and services within Government and its strategic partners, improve e-services, reduce development costs, promote data reuse and prevent information redundancy.

Management had explained that the PBS interfaces were planned to be operationalized after the budget planning and preparation activities for the year 2022-2023 are completed and before the budget approval.

Non-development and updating of interfaces may lead to errors in the budgeting data and inaccuracy of information between systems. It also compromises the efficiency of the system as created to deliver.

Management further explained that the EPBS interfaces ride on the NITA-U Platform (UG-Hub), which is restricted to PBS, IFMS and HCM. Whereas the HCM interface has been implemented on the platform, the interface with IFMS is currently ongoing and the delay has been attributed to the time lag in upgrading both systems.

I advised Management to engage the different stakeholders to ensure the information- sharing interfaces are developed, tested and implemented to support the PBS global role.

ix. Failure to update changes in the budget figures after supplementary and virements

An approved supplementary budget allocates additional funding to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) whereas virements reallocate resources to different budget items in a financial year. Supplementary and virements, therefore, change the budgetary figures for the year.

A review of the old PBS revealed that changes in the budget (supplementary and virements) after appropriation, preparation and submission of approved budget estimates were not reflected in the final performance reports. Only the original appropriation is uploaded to the system.











I advised Management to improve PBS reporting templates and ensure the inclusion of supplementary budgets and revised budgets to enhance the accountability and usability of reports.

x. Absence of a basis for allocation of funds for the PIAPs in the current budgeting cycle

The NDP III Programmes Implementation Action Plan (PIAP) outlines the key programme elements which are; the Programmes themselves, Sub-programmes, Objectives, Interventions, Outputs, Actions, the Lead implementer and other implementing MDAs for the activities.

The PIAP provides annual estimates of financial resources to be invested by the Government to realise the goal of the NDP III. It also consolidates the financial resources required to implement the actions of all the 20 Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs). The resources are disaggregated by Programme and by the MDAs and LGs responsible for their implementation.

However, I noted that the budget ceilings/MTEFs set for the several programmes, sub- programmes, objectives and interventions do not match with the annual set figures in the PIAP. The MTEFs are not set based on the PIAP estimates set, yet the MDAs are required to report deliverables and perform using the PIAP outputs/indicators.

A sample of PIAPs and appropriated figures for FY 22/23 shown in the table below indicate variances in budget figures for several programmes with some such as Human Capital Development having allocations exceeding the PIAP allocation by UGX.2,711.43 Bn and an overall deviation of UGX.8,633.12 Bn less than the PIAP projected figures for the same FY.

Table 74: NDP III Public sector Budget Allocations against Approved Budget estimates FY 22/23 for selected programmes Programme NDP III Public sector Revised Annual The variance Percentage Budget Allocations Budget between annual Variances (Ugx Bn.) FY2022/23 Estimates (UGX Budget Estimates & Bn.) NDP III (UGX Bn.) FY2022/23 Intergraded transport 5385.00 4171.65 -1,213.35 -22.53% infrastructure and services Regional Development 4228.00 1190.18 -3,037.82 -71.85% Climate Change, Natural 2088.00 617.40 -1,470.60 -70.43% Resource, Env't & Water Mgt Public Sector Transformation 3847.00 206.28 -3,640.72 -94.64%











xi. Reporting NPD III objectives indicators as percentages

At the strategic/macro level, tracking progress made during the implementation of the NDP III is done through a set of NDP III strategic level objectives indicators. The five strategic objectives are;

- Enhance value addition in Key Growth Opportunities
- Strengthen private sector capacity to drive growth and create jobs
- Consolidate & increase stock and quality of Productive Infrastructure
- Enhance the productivity and social well-being of the population and
- Strengthen the role of the State in development.

The measurement basis of the indicators in PBS is fixed in percentage even for indicators which can be measured in other forms such as days, currency among others, as indicated in table below;

Table 75: PIAP indicators and their measurement Indicator Measurement in PIAPs Measurement basis in PBS Average monthly nominal UGX Percentage household Income Net annual no. of jobs created Number of Jobs Percentage Energy generation capacity Megawatts Percentage Water usage Life expectancy at birth

M3 per capita Percentage Years Percentage Maternal Mortality Ratio/100,000, No per 100,000 Percentage

Travel Time with GKMA Travel Time on Railway Network

Min/Km Percentage Days Percentage

Freight Cargo Traffic Tones Percentage The unit cost of Internet USD Percentage

Failure to link the NDP III objectives’ indicators to the reporting output indicators leads to misleading reporting of the achievements.

Management explained that data on PIAPs was loaded on the PBS based on a submission from NPA. Nonetheless, the Ministry reconciled the indicators with NPA as part of the ongoing review of the NDP III.











Without the ability to plan and budget for their activities and having to depend on the approval of the finance and administration department for the allocation and releases, the work of the internal audit function will be grossly affected hence leading to a conflict of interest.

Failure to have an independent internal audit unit weakens the internal controls in an organisation since it will have to seek approval and release its resources from Management.

Management explained that the creation of Departments on the PBS is premised on the approved structure by the Ministry of Public Service.

In the spirit of good governance, management should configure the PBS system to enable the internal audit units and/or departments to independently budget for their activities.

4.2.3. Information systems audit of the Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) at Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT)

The Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) is a project by the Ministry of Works and Transport to license drivers and improve safety on the country’s roads. It is run by the Uganda Security Printing Company (USPC), which is a joint venture between the state- owned Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation (UPPC) and M/S Veridos GmbH, a German firm.

UDLS is a System used in production and issuance of computerised driving licenses by USPC on behalf of Government. UDLS Development project commenced in 2020 and became operational in March 2021. USPC replaced M/S Face Technologies whose contract had expired on 28th February 2021.

The major processes of UDLS include; Application for the Driver License (Reception- Front Desk), Client enrolment/Biometric data capture/Live Scan, Approval/Validation of the client data captured, Payments for the Driver’s Permit, Driver’s Permit-Card Production and Driver’s Permit Issuance to the clients who can access services from the Kampala office and the six (6) regional offices i.e., Mbarara, Fort Portal, Jinja, Mbale, Gulu and Arua.











In the absence of complete expenditure records for both Capital and Operational costs, I could not assess the extent of investment made by USPC at the time of the audit.

Management had requested in their letter dated 25th March 2022 for an extension of the audit period in which they had hoped to provide the outstanding documents. However, the documents remained outstanding despite the extension of the audit period.

I implored Management to ensure that investment records are properly kept to track the USPC investment.

ii. Management of UDLS Project Assets

I noted the following inconsistencies in the Management of UDLS Assets;

a) Sub-contract of UDLS Asset Acquisition to Technology Associates (TA) and Integrated Transport Solutions Limited (ITSL

I established that Ms Technology Associates (TA) was outsourced by M/S Veridos GmbH and Veridos Uganda to manage capital acquisitions contrary to the Joint Venture agreement. In addition, I noted that the Integrated Transport Solutions Limited (ITSL) was contracted to manage Human Resource Management, Project Management and strategic communication support however, it was also involved in the acquisition of capital assets such as computers, furniture etc. for the project, which was outside their contractual scope.

Contracting a third party outside the Joint Venture casts doubt on the capacity of M/S Veridos and could result in a contractual breach, affecting the project's intended objectives. This also impedes proper contract management.

b) Gaps in Asset Management I noted the that;

- Of the 807 items recorded in the USPC/UDLS asset register,165 items did not have their unit prices and acquisition dates captured despite the items being in existence.
- Physical inspection and verification established that the enrolment van valued at UGX.529,073,801 could not be accessed since it was purportedly still with M/S Technology Associates which was contracted outside the Joint Venture.

- Four enrollment kits (Laxlon mobile case with enrolment) valued at UGX.144 Mn are still housed at URC UDLS headquarters due to delayed operationalisation of the enrollment van.

- A number of assets were obsolete and unfit for use by the time they were handed over.

- Although three project motor vehicles had been passed over to the MoWT, with registration numbers UAT 377W, UAT 829P and UAU 921T in the makes of Prado Golden, Premio grey and Premio silver white, I noted that the transfer process of these vehicles to the Ministry had not been completed by the time of the audit.











In light of the above, I could not confirm the accuracy of the asset register, assets inherited from Face Technologies and those procured by the Joint Venture reported in the asset register.

Management indicated that it was committed by 31 st August 2022 to transfer all the project assets to the names of USPC and mainstream all subcontracts in relation to the main Contract between USPC and MoWT.

I await the outcome of management’s efforts towards streamlining their asset management.

iii. Lack of interface with critical systems

UDLS lacked automated interfaces with key systems such as the Police Verification System (PVS) used to issue and verify certificates of competence (CoC) and the Refugees Management Information System (RIMS) operated by the Office of the Prime (OPM) for Refugee biodata verification to enable refugees to possess Driving Licenses.

As a result, I established that CoC from the Inspector of Vehicles is manually captured. This exposed the entity to risk of errors in critical government data and irregularities associated with human interventions and incomplete information.

Management acknowledged that it is true that UDLS is not yet linked to the Police system and the Refugees Management Information System (RIMS) of OPM, however, it was a work in progress.

I advised Management to ensure that the UDLS is integrated with appropriate key Government systems after consultation with key stakeholders.

iv. IT risk management framework.

I reviewed the UDLS risk management practices in line with the best practices and I noted that the entity had no IT risk management framework and as a result, there was no proactive management of IT Risk.

Given the dynamic nature of the IT environment, risks emerge continuously, and some may culminate into disastrous outcomes if left unchecked.











Management explained that USPC had no internal audit function; the Ministry would engage USPC to establish the internal audit function in order to minimise the risks.

I advised Management to work with those charged with governance at MoWT to ensure that an internal audit function is established and that it is properly equipped with the necessary tools to enable it get fully involved in the review of the information systems.

vi. IT Continuity Plans/Disaster Recovery Plan

Best practice requires and ICT project to have a BCP/DRP. At the time of the audit, USPC had not developed an IT continuity plan to reduce the impact of a significant disruption on key business functions and processes in case of disaster. This could lead to major disruptions in the business, including loss of revenue in an event that risks materialise.

Management acknowledged that there was no documented IT Disaster Recovery Plan. However, there was a Data Recovery Centre installed with a fireproof door, fire detection & suppression system with real time duplication of the UDLS database with a Recovery Point Objective of 5 minutes.

Management committed to engage USPC to document the measures in place into an IT Disaster Recovery Plan. I advised Management to implement a formal IT continuity and disaster recovery strategy to ensure that IT continues to serve the business in whatever circumstances.

vii. Overlapping/conflicting roles

A review of the system user roles and responsibilities revealed that some system users at UDLS hold conflicting roles for instance: some users had administrative access to both application and databases; programmers had access to system production environments, and some support staff had privileges to print learners’ permits.

All these violations put the entity at a high risk of undetected misuse of user rights and potential loss of revenue.

Management committed to engage USPC to implement the recommended actions.











I advised Management to develop an IT security policy/plan in consultation with other stakeholders and in compliance with the industry standards.

ix. System unavailability on Saturdays

Whereas the UDLS is expected to provide services from Monday to Saturday, I noted instances of system downtime, especially on Saturdays thus denying services to clients.

System downtime affects service delivery to clients and hampers the envisaged benefits of the system availability.

Management acknowledged the concern and stated that the occurrences were as a result of unstable internet bandwidth. Further, management indicated that the Ministry was engaging NIRA to provide a redundant data line for backup in case of service breakdown.

I advised Management to ensure system availability in a bid to extend services to citizens as envisaged.

4.3. HIGHLIGHTS OF VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT RESULTS

4.3.1. Government of Uganda’s Efforts to Eliminate Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Line with the Nationally Agreed Target Linked to SDG 5.2

In September 2015, the Government of Uganda committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, one of whose targets (Target 5.2.1) aims at eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including Intimate Partner Violence against Women (EIPVW).

Uganda recorded a decrease in intimate partner violanece between from 60% to 56% in the years between 2011 and 2016. This is however higher than the global average of 35%. There was a reported 30% increase in violence aganainst women and girls since the outbreak of COVID-19. The police crime report 2019/20 indicated a 29% rise in domestic violence cases from 13,693 to 17,664 between 2019 to 2020.

It is from the above background that I conducted an audit whose overall objective was to assess Government of Uganda’s efforts to eliminate Intimate Partner Violence against women in line with the nationally agreed target linked to SDG 5.2.

- A general increase in Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in 2021 compared to 2016 regardless of the level of education attained, age group, or sub region. Sexual and psychological violence rose by 11% and 7% respectively, while physical violence reduced by 1% over the same period. The rise was linked to the COVID- 19 restrictions that increased exposure of victims and limited access to prevention and response services for GBV.

- The higher the level of education of women and girls, the lower the level of IPV experienced/reported, in both 2016 and 2020. For instance, in 2020, only 19.4% of women who studied beyond secondary school level reported physical or sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, compared to 38.3% of the women and girls who never obtained formal education.











- Acholi sub-region had the highest prevalence of IPVW (64.9%), followed by Bukedi (60.3%) and Karamoja (49.9%) sub regions. Five sub-regions in the Central, western and south western (Ankole, Tooro, Bunyoro, Busoga and South Central) registered a decline in cases of physical and /or sexual violence against women and girls between 2016 and 2020, while the other ten sub-regions registered increased incidents. South Central sub-region recorded the highest decline in reported IPVW cases- from 24.2% in 2016 to 15% in 2020, a reduction of 9.2 percentage points.

- Uganda generally has in place a coherent legal, policy and institutional framework at national level (and partially at local government level) to combat GBV/ IPV, although some critical legislation addressing aspects of IPVW are not yet complete. These include the Sexual Offences Bill, Legal Aid Bill and Policy and the review of the Domestic Violence Act and Regulations, 2010.

- That whereas the National Action Plan for Elimination of GBV (2016 - 2021) sought a budget of UGX 89.67 billion to facilitate implementation of all identified interventions for eliminating all forms of GBV over the five-year period, only UGX 10 billion was mobilised. 90% (UGX 9 billion) of this financing came through donor financing thereby raising a sustainability challenge.

- That staffing for officers responsible for GBV interventions in local governments stood at an average of 40% for the twelve districts visited. The low number of staff involved in GBV interventions in the districts is aggravated by the fact that these few officers are also central to coordination, development, implementation of culture and community-based services, programmes and projects in the district and urban councils thus limiting the time allocated to GBV issues in the districts.
- Only 18 (with 20 shelters) of the 135 districts countrywide had shelters with a combined capacity of 280 GBV victims. However, MoGLSD did not have a budget provision for the day to day running of these shelters and at the time of audit, they were all run by NGOs financed by development partners. This deprives GBV victims in the remaining 117 districts of shelter services or makes it costly for them to access the shelters. For instance, some sub-regions that recorded a high prevalence of IPV cases amongst women and girls in 2020- such as Kigezi (38.8%) and Lango (34.6%) - did not have any shelters.

- Although UBOS, in collaboration with MoGLSD, developed and localized the indicators for measuring progress on intimate partner violence, and included them in the National Statistical Indicator Framework (NSI) update of 2018, the framework does not provide periodic targets against which progress can be measured prior to 2030.

- There was limited enrolment of districts onto the National GBV database (only 94 out of 135), and limited utilisation of the database by the districts enrolled (20% in 2019, and 57% in 2021). There is also no interface between Police records and the HMIS. This leads to shortcomings in data sharing between different actors to whom IPV cases are reported.











 Investigate the major causes of the IPV prevalence rates in the different regions of the country to ensure targeted and specific interventions are made to address the vice.

 Prioritise the review, development and/or update of the pending legal, policy and institutional frameworks aimed at EIPVW and more actively engage key stakeholders in the development of EIPVW policies and legislation including victims of IPV, local governments and religious/ cultural institutions to ensure that all views are considered and the needs of those most vulnerable to IPV are addressed.

 Collaborate with MoFPED to mobilise funds necessary to operationalise the institutional arrangements stipulated in the National Action Plan for Elimination of GBV for effective coordination and implementation of IPV interventions.

 Liaise with MoFPED and NPA to provide a specified budget code for GBV interventions in the budget framework papers for all responsible MDAs and LGs. This forms a basis of lobbying for GBV interventions in the budgeting process and also facilitates identification of groups vulnerable to GBV for special consideration.

 Engage all IPV/GBV partner agencies and LGs to recruit or appoint and train IPV/GBV responsible persons and in collaboration with relevant partners lay out detailed strategies for protection and rehabilitation of the victims of IPV through establishment of shelters providing resources for their routine operations.

Conclusion

Although the Government of Uganda committed to eliminate Intimate Partner Violence against women and girls by 2030 (SDG Target 5.2.1), the audit noted an increase in incidences of IPVW in 2020 as compared to 2016, presenting a risk that Uganda will not meet the aforementioned SDG target unless deliberate interventions are implemented to address the gaps noted in this report. Achievement of tangible progress towards elimination of IPVW by 2030 will require multi-stakeholder engagement and adoption of a whole-of-government approach to ensure no one is left behind.











This audit was instituted following public outcry arising from delayed/ inadequate response to emergencies in the country, a high proportion of seriously injured causalities in need of emergency services. This was informed by the Uganda police annual crime reports and the COVID-19 epidemic cases that tested the health services’ preparedness to handle medical emergencies. I noted that the sector faced challenges in responding to emergencies across the country.

The objective of the audit was to assess the efforts of the Ministry of Health in ensuring provision of quality emergency care services in the country.

Although there are notable achievements, for instance: development of the EMS Policy 2021; EMS Strategy 2020/21-2024/25 and EMS norms and standards for ambulances as key legislations; and development of 12 indicators to track EMS delivery in the country which are existent in the DHIS 2 platform and setting up and operationalization of two regional call and dispatch centres at Naguru and Masaka Regional Referral Hospitals (RRHs) audit noted the following areas for improvement.

Inspite of the above achievement, the following were observed;

- MoH had not developed 75% (15 out of 20) of key legislations as stipulated in the WHO framework at different EMS levels, at the time of the audit. The undeveloped legislation include; the Bystander protection legislation and the EMS Act to enable the government to enforce desirable EMS practices among others. I also noted that the EMS Policy, Strategy, norms and standards of ambulances were not widely disseminated to the people in communities and staff in the EMS units who are the implementers and providers of EMS services.

- Twelve (12) out of the fourteen (14) regional call and dispatch centres representing 86% supposed to be set up and operationalized by MoH had not been set up by the time of the report. The ministry had not operationalized the universal medical access or toll free number/ three (3) digit code for access of emergency medical services by patients and health facilities.

- MoH had no comprehensive database for existing ambulances. Mismatches were observed in the actual numbers of ambulances attached to some of the facilities compared with those of the ambulance census report.

- the undesirable 178 type A government ambulances had not been phased out by the intended deadline of end of the FY 2020/2021. Procurement of ambulances was neither planned nor included in the EMS departmental budgets for the period under review.

- None of the procured 12 boat ambulances were allocated or deployed to any of the island districts as planned but left idle at the Entebbe marine base for over a year, defeating the objective of securing these ambulances and undermining the value for money of USD1,870,714 and UGX 1,347,480,000 spent on procurement of these boat ambulances.

- Seventy-Five per cent (75%) of the ambulances, subjected to the checklist tool to assess the minimum equipment and supplies stipulated in the National operating guidelines and standards for ambulances, lacked all the required











minimum basic life support equipment and supplies. In effect they only act as transport vehicles.

- Sixteen (16) out of eighteen (18), representing 89% of the visited health facilities had no fully dedicated personnel in their emergency units to manage emergency cases yet visited Health Centres IVS, on average, receive 2-5 emergency cases a day while general hospitals receive 10-30 emergency cases a day on average.

- MoH had not reviewed the Uganda National Minimum Health Care package to prioritize emergency care at Health facility level and in the pre-hospital phase. None of the visited health facilities/hospitals across all levels were aware of the standard essential emergency medicine and supplies list to guide the planning and placing emergency medicine orders to NMS. Facilities/hospitals instead utilised the general Essential medicines and health supplies list to place orders to the NMS.

I advised the Accounting Officer to address the identified challenges through;

 Prioritise, plan and budget for development of the relevant legislations and laws for management of EMS in its annual operational plans

 Develop, disseminate and institutionalise standard emergency medical equipment lists for basic life support equipment necessary at the different levels of health care and prioritise their procurement for the emergency units across the different health facilities.

 Prioritise the development and specification of an emergency medicines and supplies list and incorporate it into the Uganda Essential medicines and Health supplies list.

 Engage Uganda Communication Commission and Telecom companies to prioritise the operationalization of the standard national three-digit toll free number for the management of EMS cases. Set up and operationalize the national and all regional call centres

 Government through MoH should prioritise procurement of Type B and Type C ambulances in its annual budgets and operational plans in order to increase their accessibility to the public as well as fostering delivery of quality EMS care during transportation of patients











 Fast track the establishment of the multi-stakeholder coordination committee and implement the Public Private Partnership Health strategies to ease provision of quality EMS across the country.

Conclusion

In order to facilitate the efficient delivery of emergency medical services in the country, the Ministry of Health through the EMS department was meant to develop appropriate legislations for EMS, institute desirable stakeholder coordination arrangements, ensure availability of emergency medical equipment, medicines and supplies in established emergency units across the country, establish and operationalize national and regional call and dispatch centres, train health care providers in EMS practices, procure desirable ambulances and undertake monitoring and evaluation of EMS delivery in the country. The findings reveal weaknesses at every level of what should be a critical component in the health care system. The desirable strategies are still hampered by weak EMS M&E systems and inadequate coordination and institutional arrangements for delivery of EMS in the country.

4.3.3. Implementation of Small-Mini-Independent Power Producers Under the Getfit Scheme in Uganda

The Energy sector was liberalized following cabinet approval of the Power Sector Reforms and Privatization Strategy (PSRPS) in 1999. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) was established to regulate the Electricity sub-sector while the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) is charged with Policy Formulation. In an attempt to stimulate private investment in small-scale renewable energy projects, ERA adopted a Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFiT) phase II scheme in 2012. However, the scheme did not attract the needed investment as the proposed tariff levels were widely viewed by investors as insufficient for new projects and high financing and project development costs made small-scale power projects unviable, even as the demand for power kept growing.

To respond to the challenges for the small-scale projects, ERA and the German Development Bank (KfW), developed and implemented the Global Energy Transfer (GET FiT) Program in 2012.











In light of the foregoing justification, I instituted this audit with the overall objective of the to evaluate the performance of small/mini IPPs and examine mechanisms instituted by ERA to ensure that they generate affordable, accessible, reliable and environmentally friendly electricity in Uganda.

The audit made the following observations;

- There was lack of competition during procurement of IPPs to the extent that 15 out of the 17 sampled small/mini hydro power plants, which commenced construction and were commissioned after the enactment of the PPP Act 2015 and PPP regulations 2016, were not subjected to any competition before securing the sites. Only the two (2) sampled solar plants (Tororo and Soroti) were secured through a competitive process. Audit could not confirm whether value for money had been achieved by the selected firms.

- In 2018, 20% of the planned energy generation from GET FiT projects was not delivered to the grid due to missing or inadequate grid infrastructure. Similarly, in 2019 and 2020; 23% and 25% of the energy generation from GET FiT power plants respectively failed to reach the national grid due to grid availability issues. This resulted into deemed (unutilised) energy claims amounting to USD10,955,149 as of June 2020. So far Government of Uganda has paid US$ 3,605,267 on deemed energy comprising US$ 668,186 and US$ 2,937,081 for the FYs 2018/2019 & 2019/2020 respectively due to pay or take contractual clauses in the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Deemed energy charged through the tariff negatively impacts on consumers prices, which is a hindrance to electricity demand, thus slowing economic growth.

- The Government of Uganda undertook both GET FiT and REFiT II program interventions in the electricity sub-sector; However, different small/mini plants were offered different tariffs and plants with low planned installed capacity attracted a high tariff compared to those with relatively high installed capacity. There were no uniform criteria used for the tariff offers, this can lead to subjectivity and hence collusion.

- Seven (7) out of the fourteen (14) operational GET FIT small/mini power plants delayed signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) ranging between 3 months to 4 years. Accordingly, of the 17 GETFIT small/mini power plants, 14 had been commissioned and were operational by the year 2020, while the 3 were still under construction as they faced challenges. Also, only 5 out of the 14 operational power plants namely; Kakira Muvumbe SHP, Nkusi SHP, Rwimi SHP and Tororo solar power plant achieved their annual planned generation in the year 2020. Three (3) plants namely; Rwimi SHP, Lubilia SHP, and Nkusi SHP were below the required plant availability that is 92%, 86% and 92% in 2020. This delays the intended benefits of the scheme.

- An MOU signed between ERA and NEMA, dated 21st July 2016, required ERA and NEMA to undertake joint inspections of projects and activities to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For all the inspections undertaken by ERA for the last 3 years, there was no evidence of NEMA involvement. Whereas ERA identified and reported a number of environmental concerns during their annual compliance audits, there was no evidence of sharing such findings with NEMA for appropriate action as provided for by the MOU.











I advised the Chief Executive Officer of ERA to:

 Ensure for future projects, sites for the small/mini power plant are competitively secured by potential developers to enhance economic and social-economic benefits from these projects.

 Engage key stakeholders as MEMD, UEDCL, and UETCL to improve network availability and efficiency through establishment of dedicated evacuation lines as a way of mitigating grid failure. The upgrades of substations and evacuation lines should be timely undertaken and maintained to avoid unnecessary deemed energy claims.

 Ensure that the licensing procedures for IPPs are streamlined to ensure equitable licensing periods offered to all license applicants. In addition, full operationalization of the coordination with sister agencies that have MoUs with ERA like NEMA and DWRM should be prioritized to facilitate timely licensing processes, monitoring and followup.

 Consider subsidizing the final consumer tariffs so as to grow the electricity connectivity specifically in rural areas if the GET FiT program is to realize its intended objectives of securing energy supply at relatively affordable cost.

Conclusion

Since the inception of the GeTFiT programme in 2013, an amount of 122MW of power had been added to the generation mix by the beneficiaries of the scheme by 2020 with 14 out of 17 plants commissioned. Despite the availability of such capacity, a significant amount of that production was lost due to lack of transmission and distribution lines to evacuate the power. There were also noted lower plant availability rates due to internal outages and low fuel availability. As such government continues to pay deemed costs for such unevaluated power.

As such the tariff charged is not cost reflective and is still high compared to the region. Because of the above, the envisaged increase in number of rural electricity accessibility has not been achieved. The objective of low carbon development, poverty reduction and climate change mitigation may not be achieved in the planned period.











4.3.4. Promotion of Safe and Sustainable Management of Electronic Waste in Uganda by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and National Guidance

Uganda, just like the rest of the world, is contending with the increased demand for Electronic and Electric Equipment (EEE) products and high technology replacement rates which together, have contributed to the emergence of e-waste as the fastest growing waste stream on earth. Whereas the Government of Uganda has expressed commitment to promoting, among other things, sound management of hazardous chemicals and e-waste, through enactment of an E-waste Policy (2012) and E-waste Strategy (2013), there is scanty up-to-date information on the quantities and types of waste generated in Uganda, and this limits the effectiveness of any planned interventions.

In light of the foregoing justification, I instituted this audit with the overall objective of establishing the quantities of e-waste in Uganda and assess the measures put in place by the Ministry of Information, Communications Technology and National Guidance to promote safe and sustainable management of electronic waste in Uganda.

a) The quantities of electronic waste in Uganda have been increasing exponentially over the last 20 years, and this trend is likely to continue if appropriate interventions are not undertaken. From 2001 to 2020, about 1.3 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in Uganda, with only three (3) dominant categories, namely: screens, monitors and equipment containing screens; large equipment (excluding photovoltaic panels); and temperature exchange equipment accounting for nearly 83% of this waste. However, the most dominant categories of e-waste have kept changing over the years.

b) I noted that the strategy for implementation of E-Waste 2013-2018 had 8 strategic objectives with a total of 84 performance indicators. Out of the 84 indicators, only 3 indicators were fully implemented (4%), 7 indicators were partially implemented (8%) and 74 were not implemented (88%). I further examined the implementation of the strategy and noted the following;

 Although NEMA had incorporated e-waste related issues into the National Environment Act, 2019 and the National Waste Management Regulations, 2020, review of the E-waste Policy by MoICT&NG was still on-going, over five years after its expected completion date (2016).This has delayed alignment of government interventions to keep abreast with the rapid changes in technological innovation, evolution of the nature and patterns of e-waste, and best practices in e-waste management.











on site, while others used unlicensed handlers to dispose of it. In November 2021, however, three firms were licenced by NEMA to transport e-waste and an e-waste collection and management facility set up by the National Enterprise Corporation in Bugolobi. Nonetheless, most entities and stakeholders remained unaware that licensed e-waste handlers/facilities were now available for use.

c) I noted that, apart from the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) and Uganda Communication Commission which made efforts to guide their stakeholders on disposal mechanisms for radiation-emitting equipment and telecommunication towers/masts, like take- back or extraction and storage of radioactive component(s) of broken-down equipment, there was no indication of what other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and local governments did to guide on- or enforce compliance with- proper e-waste management practices for equipment under their dockets.

d) UNBS had not developed adequate standards and testing capacity for all Electronic and Electric Equipment entering the country yet imports contribute almost 99% of EEE Put on the Uganda Market. Various potentially hazardous electronic and electronic equipment had thus been imported in the country without testing and could ultimately affect people’s health

I advised the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and National Guidance (MoICT& NG) to;

 In collaboration with key stakeholders develop mechanisms to project and establish quantities and composition of e-waste and categories of e-waste handlers to aid medium and long-term planning for proper management.

 During the anticipated review/ revision of the e-waste strategy, consult and/or involve all key stakeholders to ensure ownership of its implementation. In the interim, MoICT&NG should engage MoFPED, MoES and other stakeholders to ensure funding of e-waste activities and mainstreaming of e-waste management in curricula during the next curriculum reviews.

 Engage NEMA to expedite licensing of e-waste handlers and formulation of e- waste management procedures to enhance regulation, identify and engage private actors to set up other waste management centres (PPPs) as envisioned in the National e-waste Strategy.











The budget for implementation of the e-waste strategy was only financed to a tune of 14%; there was limited enforcement of e-waste management practices, recourse to unlicensed e-waste management companies and handlers, and inadequate testing of EEE at importation.

Limited implementation of the E-waste strategy was mostly attributed to failure by MoICT&NG to take the lead in its implementation by prioritising funding for the activities assigned to the Ministry, lack of coordination and engagement of all other key players to fulfil their roles. These deficiencies expose people and ecosystems to the potential health and contamination risks associated with e-waste. It is hoped that implementation of the proposed audit recommendations will contribute significantly to improved management of e-waste in Uganda.

4.3.5. Effectiveness of Mechanisms Established for Management of Road Equipment by the Ministry of Works and Transport

The maintenance of roads in Uganda is currently implemented through the force account mechanism. This requires government agencies to make use of their available man power and equipment in the maintenance of the road network, instead of the lengthy and usually expensive contracting to private firms. To operationalize this mechanism, the Government of Uganda spent a sum of UGX.887Bn between 2012 and 2020 on the acquisition, distribution, training, maintenance and monitoring of its road maintenance fleet. This equipment was distributed to local governments across the country.

The initiative has faced challenges in its implementation such as complaints of obsolete equipment with high breakdown rates, delays in repair of equipment at the mechanical workshops and inadequate inventory of equipment to cover the various road maintenance interventions. There are increasing complaints and evidence of deteriorating road conditions in the country.

The Overall objective of the audit was to assess the mechanisms established by the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) for management and utilisation of road equipment.

- I noted that in the period of assessment, from 2017/18 to 2019/20, the road maintenance backlog had increased from 42,248KMs at the start for the period to 69,016KMs at the end of the period representing an increase of 37.6% in spite of the government interventions in form of road equipment and funds through Uganda Road Fund.

- From 2012 to 2020 Government of Uganda acquired a total of 1,843 pieces of road maintenance equipment which were all distributed to the intended beneficiaries. I however noted that, of this only 1,151 (62%) pieces were in working condition, 645 (35%) pieces grounded though in serviceable state and 47 (3%) broken down and due for disposal. This further explains the increased backlogs in maintenance and deteriorating road conditions

- In regard to shared zonal equipment, audit established that out of the 1,843 equipment, fifty seven (57) specialised heavy equipment were distributed to 4 MoWT Zonal Centres which serve 135 districts and MDAs directly carrying out road maintenance works. This was insufficient in quantity. In addition, MoWT











only acquired 9 low beds to aid the movement of heavy equipment between different sites. This number was not sufficient to serve the LGs who equally did not have low beds of their own. This led to long lead times (average of one year) for mobilisation of equipment and subsequently resulting in delays for road maintenance activities

- In regard to repair of road equipment, for a sample of 30 LGs, I established that equipment that underwent major repairs at the regional workshops on average spent a period of 3.25 months in the workshops, additionally two (2) (Gulu and Mbarara) of the four Regional mechanical workshops lacked sheltered work floor space and work tools to efficiently repair and service the equipment under their care. That further explains the delays to repair and service the equipment. This leads to delays in provision of the needed maintenance services.

I advised the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Works and Transport to;

 Ensure that a needs assessment is undertaken prior to implementing such countrywide programs. In the event of limited funding, management should also explore the option of piloting such programs in fewer districts for effectiveness.

 Expedite the development of the MIS systems such that information relating to the distribution of shared equipment can be seamlessly captured to streamline the scheduling, distribution, operation and movement of equipment. The Information system will also ensure that all repair requests are well documented and communicated and strict pre repair inspection carried out so that the defects have been promptly reported.

 Continue to negotiate with MoFPED to ensure that the necessary funding is availed to facilitate the retooling process and ensure availability of safe sheltered working areas for the Regional Mechanical Workshops (RMWs) staff.

Conclusion

The increase in the road maintenance backlog was attributed to ineffective implementation of the equipment management mechanisms by both the MoWT and the respective agencies in the Works sector. There were noted incidences of lack of needs assessment hence inadequate equipment, rampant breakdowns, lack of training of operators, delays in repairs and lack of monitoring by MoWT.











4.3.6. A Value for Money Audit Report on the Regulation and Promotion of Safe and Reliable Public Road Transport System by The Ministry of Works and Transport

The Dominance of road transport as a mode of transportation in Uganda accounts for more than 90 percent of passenger transit and cargo freight. Even though public road transport is the most popular method of transportation, the Public Transport Industry has a number of obstacles: only buses are fully regulated, Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) services are not timetabled or integrated, and PSVs are typically in Dangerous Mechanical Conditions (DMCs). . The situation is made worse by the usage of uncontrolled commercial motorcycles (Boda bodas) that breach traffic regulations the absence of implementation of institutional and regulatory procedures for enhancing public transportation.

Taxis, Minibuses, and Commercial Motorcycles operate off-route and will stop wherever a passenger desires to board or exit. According to Uganda's yearly crime statistics (2017-2021), there were a total of 74,977 victims of traffic accidents, the bulk of which were caused by Careless or Reckless Driving and Dangerous Mechanical Conditions.

In light of the above, the Office of the Auditor General conducted a Value for Money audit to assess Government of Uganda’s efforts in Regulation and Promotion of a Safe and Reliable Public road transport system in Uganda through the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT). Below is a summary of the Key findings which details are in Chapter Four of this report.

Although the Department of Transport Regulation and Safety, of the Ministry of Works and Transport, has been recognized for notable accomplishments in the promotion of a reliable and safe public transport system, such as the significant improvement (from 5 working days in 1990 to 20 Minutes in 2022) in the time between applying for and receiving a driver's license, the following key areas of improvement were identified:

- Field inspections established that majority of Public Service Vehicles (PSV) were in operation but not registered in the Ministry’s database. Although the data records at the Ministry show that they have licensed, on average, 28,000 PSVs per annum during the last 5 years, data obtained from the PSV owners’ associations indicate that, as of November 2022, the registered member PSVs were 749,600. Furthermore, the Ministry's register lacked information such as Licensed Stages, Licensed Routes of Operation, and Time Schedules, which may have contributed to the efficient operation of public transportation.

- 139 (70%) out of the randomly sampled 200 PSVs did not possess Valid PSV licenses that would allow them to operate Public transport business. The largest numbers without licences are the boda bodas (95%). As a result, vehicles are used for public transport without validation checks for their road worthiness. In addition Government of Uganda loses UGX29.5 Billion annually in Non-Tax revenue due to non-licensed PSVs operating in the country.

- I noted that only 5.73% (140,577 out of the required 2,455,363) PSV inspections were undertaken by the Ministry of Works and Transport during the period under review. The lack of PSV inspections was more prevalent in the Commercial Motor Cycle category and Taxis. This was caused by lack of personnel and the required equipment to conduct PSV inspections across the country and the delayed implementation of the SGS Automotive Services Uganda contract. The Public is thus exposed to risks of vehicles in poor mechanical conditions.











- I noted for the few inspections that were carried out by the Ministry, these were conducted with the use of observation. MoWT lacks the facilities, key equipment such as; Screen Type headlight tester/ Light intensity tester, Speedometer tester, Break speed combination Tester, Digital Tyre tread depth gauge among others. The absence of quality inspections does not guarantee the roadworthiness of PSVs examined.

- I noted that 34% (77 out of 226) of the inspected driving schools were operating without valid operating licenses issued by the Ministry of Works and Transport. As a result, the Ministry doesn't have a complete list of all driving schools in the country both Licensed and unlicensed. The public is thus undertaking lessons in schools without guaranteed quality and standards. In addition, from the sample, the Government of Uganda loses UGX 35.4 million shillings every year due to unlicensed driving schools operating in the country.

- I noted that Majority driving school owners did not poses and were not using the approved driver learner training materials issued by the Ministry. Many used self- developed materials while others used class B training materials to train drivers for other classes like CI, DI, CE and others. As a result, driving schools in Uganda continue to utilize non-standardized training materials, resulting in non- standardized competence of drivers on the road, which is one of the contributors to the country's high rate of road accidents.

- I noted that the Inspector of Vehicle (IOV) centres are not monitored by the Ministry as is required by the regulations. There was no proof of evidence of receipt of IOV's monthly learner driver test reports during the past five years and no documentation proof of formal correspondence between the MoWT and IOV demanding the same. This has led to a lack of certainty regarding whether the IOV tests students who have genuinely received training in driving schools and whether these student drivers have received training from licensed driving schools.

- I conducted a System walk through at the Uganda Driver Licensing System (UDLS) railway station offices in Kampala and reviewed that, out of the 6 required documents, 4 documents (competency certificate, medical form, certificate of completion, and proof of enrolment) are not verified before issuance of a driving license.

- I noted that 70% of the sampled applicants, had received training from a non- licensed driving school, while 28 out of 94 applicants, (29.8%), had received training from a licensed driving school. 30% (30 out of 100) had serial numbers of Certificates of Competence that did not match with serial numbers issued at IoV, while 50% (50 out of 100) of applicants had serial numbers that were initially given to someone else, hence fraudulent.

- 71% (67 out of 95) of the 95 applications with attached medical forms were issued by unlicensed medical professionals, while 5% (5 out of 95) were issued by forgers (those using someone else medical registration number). 15% of the participants (14 out of 95) had not written their names and registration numbers legibly. The MoWT has failed to ensure that the issue of driver's licenses adheres











to the procedures outlined in all applicable rules. This leads to issuance of licenses to incompetent drivers.

- I noted that Ministry of Works and Transport sensitization plans lacked specific actions in regard to purpose, media type, roles and responsibilities of officials, particular activity budgets, timetables, and operational technique. Audit further established that while the ministry reported in its yearly performance reports to have carried out all planned campaigns, evidence was only provided for six (6) of twelve (12) planned campaigns of the planned campaigns. Failure to sensitize the public contributes to low compliance with PSV licensing terms and conditions.

There is also lack of coordination with the enforcement Agencies like the traffic police to enforce licensing and standards. According to the Police, they stated that they lacked the database of licensed PSV from the Ministry from which they would crosscheck to enforce compliance.

I advised the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Works and Transport to;

 Develop mechanisms to capture licensed and unlicensed PSVs in Uganda with all of their attributes, process the data, and use it to generate route charts, stages, and timetables.

 Develop and distribute monthly updated lists of licensed PSVs to enforcement agencies including urban authorities and Uganda Police. MoWT could explore the use of Mobile App to share data with the various Agencies

 Raise public awareness of the annual PSV requirement.

 In the short run liaise with the Uganda Police Inspector of Vehicles staff to conduct PSV inspections where it lacks capacity.

 Expedite discussions and negotiations with SGS to bridge the quality gaps in inspections of PSVs across the country.  Undertake a baseline to obtain data and records of all existing driving schools and confirm they have operating licenses, and work with law enforcement to close and prosecute violators.











 Develop internal controls in the UDLS system to verify the validity of all submitted documentation before issuance of driver’s license.

 Appropriately plan and prioritize actions in road safety advocacy and awareness for different players in the Public Service Transport sub-sector so that the sector is better regulated.

Conclusion

Although the Ugandan government has made significant efforts to regulate and promote a safe and reliable public road transportation system by improving the efficiency at which driver's licenses are issued among others, there were numerous gaps noted including unlicensed driving schools PSVs and motor cycles, limited and inadequate annual inspections and lack of enforcement as most drivers drive without permits. These challenges have an effect of contributing towards the increased road accidents in Uganda. To ensure completeness, the Ministry of Works and Transport should ensure that PSV registration, licensing, and inspection are automated and integrated with the various other government databases of URA and Uganda Police. Similarly, the training provided by various driving schools should be consistent and monitored to ensure that standards are met. To ensure compliance with regulations and laws, sensitization and enforcement should be strengthened and coordinated with other agencies and local governments.

4.3.7. Value for Money audit of GRID Extension Projects implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency Currently under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for the period 2009 – 2017

Between 2009 and 2017, REA secured USD.80Mn from SIDA, JICA, World Bank, NORAD and the Government of Uganda to implement priority Rural Electrification Projects most of which were part of the sample of projects under review.

The Scope of the audit covered the GRID extension power line projects implemented in the 13 service territories under the various funding programs between the financial years 2013/14 to 2017/18. The GRID Extension power-line projects assessment covered the following;

- Completed Grid Projects Implemented by REA since Financial Year 2013/2014 to 2016/17 when RESP II was being implemented

- Completed UMEME Cost Shared Lines since 2013/2014 and 2014/15.
- Schemes Implemented through Concession Operators

- Ongoing Grid Projects under Implementation by REA

- Completed Grid Projects Implemented by REA from (2009-2017) Prioritized by Rural Electrification Agency.











In light of the foregoing, I undertook this Value for Money audit to assess whether construction of Grid extension power lines and associated installations implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) was undertaken in accordance with recommended technical standards, designs and specifications; assess the quality and functionality of the completed power-lines and associated installations and its impact on the user communities. I made the following observations;

There have been Positive Economic Impacts realized from constructed GRID Lines, for instance;

Urbanization of several trading centres along the power lines constructed, many income-generating activities were initiated by the locals such as maize milling, wielding, salons, juice production thus improving their incomes and way of life and creation of employment opportunities; promoting value addition to the local agricultural products and dairy products; reduction in greenhouse emissions.

Improved investment climate in targeted communities; and increase in government revenue.

However, there are still some performance gaps in operation of rural electrification projects that need to be addressed as summarised below;

- I circularized contractors and noted that, REA owed nine (9) firms for works already completed worth USD.28,080,776.53 and UGX.3,350,908,860.

- Out of the commissioned lines, UMEME attracted and obtained O&M rights for about 25% for township lines. UEDCL obtained about 60% of the O&M rights leaving the 15% to the other operators.

- Audit did not get evidence of any deliberate O&M policies or practices specifically on the preventative maintenance. I was not provided with preventative maintenance plans, nor was there proof of a structured and consistence implementation of basic prudent maintenance practices on the lines.

- Although ERA is mandated to issue license to the operators, review and approve the O&M Budgets as well as regulate the operations of these licensee, audit noted minimal supervision by ERA in line with oversight monitoring and Evaluation.

- Additionally, in terms of the operating and management costs of power lines, they were deemed high due to a number of factors such as transformers, defective or rotten poles which needed replacement in the shortest of time after the commissioning of these lines. For instance, according to UEDCL data for Kabale – Kisoro – Bunagana Scheme, the annual maintenance cost was at 34.7 billion against 518 billion generated revenues. This translates 6.8% of revenue which is above the 5% threshold requirement.

- Several occupation and safety hazards noted during implementation of the GRID power projects. 33kV power lines were constructed to span across roofs











of residential houses in Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere power scheme, Mpanga- Kamwenge-Kahungye-Nkingo.

- Audit noted inadequacies in design and construction of GRID power projects; Although normal service conditions and or best practice requires that 33KV extensions should originate from substations (service bays/Bus Bars) audit noted that for most of the projects implemented by REA, MV extensions were tapped from existing feeders implying that the newly implemented MV extension automatically inherits the challenges of the backbone and vice versa. Examples were noted in Kabale-Kisoro, Gulu-Acholibur, Masindi- Waki- Buliisa, Opuyo-Moroto, Ibanda- Kazo- Rushere, Gulu-Adjumani-Moyo.

- Voltage drops were also witnessed during field inspections for all extensions beyond 100km that did not originate from the substation. High voltage drops, below the permissible level can result in increased system maintenance costs, a decrease in the safety and performance of the network as well as reduced expected lifetime of the equipment.

- In line with contractual requirements, wooden poles are expected to last up to 20years. Document review and field inspections noted that poles supplied on some projects as; Masindi- Waki-Buliisa, Ibanda-Kazo-Rushere, Gulu-Acholibur, Kitgum-Palabek, Ayer-Kamdini among others, failed due to rotting, insect Infestation, pole burning and breaking. No document was availed to ascertain that quality control procedures were followed. Furthermore, no effort was recognized from REA that the defective wooden poles are claimed back from the respective pole suppliers.

I have made the following recommendations to the Accounting Officer of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) which has now inherited the functions of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under which the GRID power projects were implemented and recommended that;

 The outstanding amounts owed to contractor’s firms are paid for works that are completed and verified to avoid incurring penalties on delayed payments

 To continuously address Environmental and social issues in contracts and their implementation and ensure that all contracts for implementation of GRID power projects make it mandatory for the implementation firms to prepare environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) reports in addition to resultant Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement Action Management Plans (RAMPs).











be monitored and controlled unlike wooden poles whose quality is determined by many factors from the time they are planted, harvested, treated at the factory, and eventually transported to site.

 MEMD strengthens project management, monitoring and supervision arrangements for GRID power projects to ensure that all GRID projects are implemented within project time lines, indicated in the approved activity work programs and contracts.

 For Power schemes implemented through concession operators, MEMD ensures that:

o The licensed firms operating under concession agreements undertake effective operation and maintenance activities in respect of replacing all non-function GRID equipment as blown fuses, surge arrestors, replacing broken poles, faulty transformers to keep the power lines functional o MEMD closely monitors and supervises the licensees to establish that they comply with the license terms and conditions and fulfil the objective of increasing access to electricity.

4.3.8. A value for money audit report on management of senior citizens grant by the expanding social protection programme under the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development

The Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD) in partnership with the British Department for International Development (DFID) and Irish Aid is implementing the Expanding Social Protection Programme (ESPP) whose aim is to provide cash transfers to the poorest and most vulnerable people in Uganda.

Social Protection is recognized world over as a critical element of national development strategies. The Uganda Vision 2040 envisages a social protection system that includes a universal pension for older persons. In addition, the National Development Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 highlights social protection as a key strategy for transforming Uganda to a modern and prosperous middle-income country.

In 2021, Uganda’s projected total population was 42,885,900 persons out of which, the proportion of older persons (>60yrs) was 1,715,436 (4%). About 32% (548,940) of all older persons are reported not working and not looking for work.











It is against this background that the I undertook a Performance audit on the management of the Social Assistance Grant for Empowerment (SAGE). The following key findings and recommendations were noted;

- The programme achieved key success in some areas, whereby all 146 districts in the country were brought on board in the financial year 2019/2020, resulting from the government commitment made in November, 2018.

- By 20th December 2022, 439,131 older persons (262,448 females and 176,673 male) had been paid, of which 128,016 were registered in the national rollout programme.

- Furthermore, the Grant had helped beneficiaries to sustain their livelihoods and access basic needs of life. The bulk of the beneficiaries indicated that they used the Grant to buy food (88.9%), medical care (57.8%), hygiene and livestock, both at (27%).

- For the period under review, out of the 285,778 targeted beneficiaries only 226,195 beneficiaries were verified by PMU, leaving 59,583 beneficiaries unverified due to lack of national IDs and having errors in their birth dates.

- Out of 226,195 beneficiaries verified in the three years under review only 159,282 were registered by PMU leaving 66,913 unregistered.
- Out of 212,711 verified and registered beneficiaries, 4,623 eligible persons of 80 years and above had neither been enrolled nor issued account numbers by the payment service provider. Whereas the PSP was required to communicate to MoGLSD reasons for delays in enrolment of the registered beneficiaries, this was not done, contrary to the service level agreement.

- 9,799 beneficiaries (2,297 persons without National Identity Cards, 2,836 persons with NINs and 4,666 infirm beneficiaries) who were originally with Post Bank Uganda Limited had not been enrolled with CERUDEB

- Comparison of SAGE MIS data with CERUDEB beneficiary data revealed that seven thousand three hundred eighty-four (7,384) out of thirty-two thousand one hundred thirty four (32,134) alternative recipients were registered in SAGE MIS but missing in the CERUDEB data. Similarly, inspection of pay points revealed that the PSP’s payment system/software used in the field to make payments does not recognize alternative recipients.

- Beneficiaries were paid quarterly while some would receive their grants after six months contrary to the bi-monthly payments provided for in the implementation guidelines.

- Out of 10 RTSUs, Mbarara RTSU had 4,904 beneficiaries who were issued bank accounts in the period between November 2021 and March 2022 but had not received cash on their accounts at the time of audit in October, 2022.

- In all the 10 districts visited, it was noted that payrolls were not used for roll calling during payment contrary to SCG implementation guidelines, 2019 which require payrolls to be used for confirming beneficiaries due for payment,











amounts credited on their accounts for a given payment cycle and as calling lists at the pay point.

- Information of both active and inactive bank accounts provided by the PSP revealed 3,344 inactive bank accounts as at October 2022 with bank balances totalling to UGX.740Mn

I have made the following recommendations:

 MoGLSD should liaise with NIRA to ensure that all potential beneficiaries get National IDs which is a requirement for them to be targeted.

 PMU through RTSUs should ensure that verification plans are availed to the districts timely for proper organisation of the verification exercise.

 PMU should ensure adequate training of district local government stakeholders is carried out to enable proper mobilisation during verification.

 PMU should develop guidelines on verification of relocated beneficiaries.

 The PMU is advised to prioritize stakeholder trainings and sensitization so as to impact knowledge and skills on how to mobilize potential beneficiaries.

 PMU should consider adjusting the 10Km radius by identifying the accessible service centres/points within the reach of the beneficiaries in consultation with the Payment Service Provider, respective Local Governments and the older person’s councils.

 The PMU should enforce the penalty provided in the service level agreement for delays in beneficiary account opening.

 The PMU should ensure that the PSP uses proper electronic gadgets for capturing the beneficiary bio-data including capture of photos and synchronization of the data.

 PMU should liaise with NIRA to ensure that all previous Post Bank beneficiaries who are not enrolled with CERUDEB due to lack of national IDs are supported to obtain them.











 PMU through the local structures should ensure that all deaths that occur before the payments cycles are reported and updated.

 PMU through the local government structures should ensure that in case of reported death, the next of kin is supported to claim the funds in a timely manner

Conclusion

The program did not target all the eligible elderly persons above 80 years due to among others lack of national IDs or errors in the National IDs resulting in so many Senior citizens missing out from the benefits of the program. The program to a large extent verified and registered most of the targeted beneficiaries; however, more strategies need to be put in place to ensure 100% verification and registration of the targeted groups. There were notable challenges with the enrolment of the beneficiaries due to lack of national IDs and inefficiencies with the bank electronic gadgets that were impeding the registration of some beneficiaries. There were also challenges of data migration from Post bank to CERUDEB and lack of national IDs by alternative recipients and delays in sharing of bank accounts by the PSP with PMU among others affecting payment of the beneficiaries.

Despite the strategies Government has put in place to ensure sustainability of the SCG program, there is need for Government to demonstrate its commitment by clearing the accumulated arrears owed to the senior citizens. The government also needs to strengthen its systems in terms of creating awareness and building capacity of the Local governments so that they can take ownership of the program.

4.3.9. A value for money audit draft report on the management of electricity connections under rural electrification programme (MEMD)

The Government of Uganda established the Electricity Connections Policy (ECP) 2018 ‐2027 with the primary objective of increasing electricity access and providing clean energy for Ugandans. The ECP is implemented under government’s Rural Electrification Programme (REP) in line with the Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan (RESP II) 2013-2022. The goal of the programme is to achieve 26% rural access target by 2022 and 60% level of access to electricity for Uganda by 2027.











It’s against this background that I conducted a Value for Money Audit on the management of the connections under the REP as these are instrumental in improving the electricity access and the attainment of social-economic transformation of the country.

The following key findings and recommendations were noted;

- Analysis of UMEME’s connections under the ECP programme revealed that the average connections made during the years under review had improved significantly from 825 per day in 2018 to 1,200 per day in 2020 (just before COVID Period) representing an increment of 45%.

- The verification exercise revealed that approximately 40% of the households visited were using power for commercial purposes such as welding, salons, retail shops; grinding maize, among others while, 60% of the households used power for domestic consumption such as lighting, viewing television, among others. This has improved the socio-economic status of the society.

- Through interview and document review of the work plans submitted to Rural Electrification Programme (REP), Service Providers (SPs) projected to connect only 567,121 households in the target years whereas the Rural Electrification Programme under the ECP had a planned target of 900,000 connections. This implies that the submitted plans were below the programme target by 332,879, which is 37% short of the ECP targets indicated above.
- Further analysis of the achievements of target connections using the ECP database revealed that the service providers made a total of only 252,491 (includes unverified figures by IVA) connections in the three years under review, representing 45% of the projected total targets of 567,121 by SPs. This would, however, represent 28% of the Programme target over the 3 years under review.

- In the period under review, Government planned to spend a sum of UGX.123.3Bn, but it only released UGX.61.0Bn, thus representing a budget performance of only 49%. This affected the attainment of the Programme targeted connections. Further analysis indicated under absorption of the released funds whereby only UGX.51.5 billion was utilized indicating utilization level of only 84% of government funds.

- Utilization of donor funding was equally very low whereby out of total available funds of USD.34.5Mn from WB-IDA and AfDB, only USD.22.9Mn (66%) was utilized. Similarly, out of EUR.20.7Mn available from KfW, GIZ, AFD, and AfDB, only EUR.19.2Mn (69%) was utilized. This constitutes an average utilization to 67.5% over the period under review.

- I noted challenges in procurement management whereby instances of delivery of incomplete sets of connection materials were noted; delayed procurements with an average delay of; excessive procurement of certain connection materials; stock outs on some materials; and unutilized materials in the stores.

- I noted instances of uncoordinated consumer awareness activities by stakeholders in an effort to market and mobilize for increased consumer connections. Service Providers solely carried out consumer awareness through outreach programs, radio and TV talk shows without the involvement of











Programme management. As a result, the envisaged awareness objective of the ECP was not achieved and consumers fell victim of unscrupulous wiremen who ended up charging them for connections which were supposed to be free or overpaying on some subsidized services of the programme.

- A review of a sample of 19 (30%) out of 61 verification reports submitted by the connections department relating to 5 SPs revealed that none were submitted on time. There was a delay in verifications by an average of 5.75 months (23 weeks) contrary to the minimum requirement of 3 months. The longest average delay of 9.75 months (39 weeks) was noted in verifying WENRECO’s connections.

I have made the following recommendations

 Programme management should review the Programme requirements to ascertain whether the envisaged programme resources can still meet the programme objectives and engage relevant stakeholder to ensure that the required resources are provided.

 MEMD should ensure that the Service Providers that undertake Programme implementation submit all the required plans which should be reviewed and approved by the Programme management; this will further facilitate programme monitoring and enable development of corrective measures in a timely manner.

 Programme management should review the SPs connection targets to ensure that they are aligned to the Programme targets, and strategies should be developed for the attainment of those targets.

 Government should prioritize funding of the Programme as planned and envisaged in the Electricity Connections Policy. The Government commitment should be followed through in the annual budgets of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals development.

 MEMD and Programme management should ensure donors funds are utilized in accordance with the agreed covenants in the funds agreements, and should iron out all bottlenecks that lead to low absorption of donor funding.











awareness, for the achievement of the objectives of the Programme as envisaged in the ECP.

Conclusion

The status of progress under the ECP programme indicated significant improvements in average connections made during the years 2018 to 2020, with a number of households using electricity for commercial purposes and domestic consumption. That notwithstanding, the ECP has been faced with a number challenges in the implementation of key activities fundamental to the achievement of Programme objectives. Notably, there was failure to meet the target electricity connections due to inadequate planning for connections, non-submission of work plans and inadequate funding. Additionally, there were inadequacies in the procurement and contract management processes, inadequate marketing and consumer awareness, delays in the verification and subsidy re-imbursements and inadequate reporting.

The Government has secured World Bank funding under the Electricity Access Scale Up Project which is expected to bridge the financing gap experienced under the ECP, and result into more electricity connections.

4.3.10. Value for Money Audit on Preparedness by OPM to respond to disasters

Disaster risk is increasingly of global concern and its impact and actions in one region can have an impact on another with Uganda being no exception. The entity mandated to handle disasters in Uganda is Office or the Prime Minister and the Local Governments.

Arising from this background, I conducted a performance study to assess whether the Office of the Prime Minister was adequately prepared to respond to disasters.

The following observations were noted from the study;

- OPM had challenges in early detection and response to disaster warnings. Some of the disasters were detected early but very little was done to adequately prepare for them. In other cases, disasters happened without early detection. It was observed that comprehensive and routine risk profiling and mapping of the disaster-prone areas was still a challenge and this was worsened by the absence of functional and reliable early warning systems.

- The immediate response to disasters by OPM was not timely and usually uncoordinated. This was because the Disaster Management Committees were not fully functional at the districts, sub county and village level which were the closest structures for response. In addition, it was observed that there were weaknesses in the existing coordination arrangements between OPM and other players.

- OPM faced challenges in search and rescue in the event of the occurrence of disaster incidents. Property and sometimes lives were lost or remained un- recovered after incidents of disasters. This was attributed to the lack of rescue equipment and inadequately trained response teams.

- OPM had challenges in post disaster handling and resettlement due to inadequate planning for post disaster resettlement. In addition, the procurement of land for











resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) remained one of the unfunded priorities in the Department’s work plan.

- Gaps were noted in the existing legal framework as evidenced by absence of the National Disaster Preparedness and Management Act and Standard Operating Procedures for management of disasters. This activity was not prioritized by management.

Conclusion

In order to address the challenges identified, OPM should prioritize risk profiling and mapping, operationalize the Disaster Risk Management plan which provides for funding for disaster management, recruitment of personnel, develop strategies on ensuring that there are functional early warning systems especially in the disaster-prone districts, develop a maintenance plan for the existing equipment as well as enhance coordination with other stakeholders.

4.3.11. Value for Money Audit on Management of Revenue by KCCA

Article 152 of the Constitution mandates Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) to levy, charge, collect and appropriate fees and taxes.

I undertook an audit to assess the performance of the Authority in regard to revenue management and below are a summary of my observations;

- The revenue targets used by the Authority were not reflective of the actual capacity of the Authority to mobilise revenue. The Authority uses revenue budgets set by MoFPED which are usually lower than the Authority’s internally generated targets. This hinders the authority from achieving its revenue collection potential.

- The Authority performed below the set revenue targets for all the sampled revenue sources. Performance of the various sources was below the set targets with shortfalls ranging between 4% and 17% of the target. The underperformance was attributed to understaffing at the revenue directorate, insufficient transport resources for revenue mobilization, and gaps within the existing legal framework.

- The Authority’s revenue arrears have continued to increase over the years. The arrears increased by 86% in the Financial Years 2018/2019 and 82% between FY 2019/2020 to FY 2021/2022. I noted that the annual recovery targets set by the Authority were low compared to the receivables and even the low targets were not met.











plans, monitoring of activities and conducting of performance evaluations of implemented activities in respective entities.

This study assessed whether Planning Units had prepared and monitored the implementation of approved development plans.

Below are some of the highlights of the study;

- I noted that 111 MDAs out of the 145 MDAs representing 77% had their development plans approved as aligned to NDP III. A total of 83 out of the 176 LGs representing 47% had their development plans approved as aligned to NDP III. The failure to have development plans that are aligned to the NDP III was attributed to late approval of the NDP-III and late trainings for planners on how to prepare well aligned plans. Failure to have well aligned plans will affect the achievement of the NDP-III objectives.

- Planning units do not undertake consultations with stakeholders during the process of preparing development plans. The only engagements that are close to the consultations envisioned in the regulations are the budget conferences that are conducted in the year preceding the preparation of the development plans. In the case of MDAs, investments priorities were determined based on aspirations of top management. This was attributed to lack of clarity by the planners on the requirement to undertake detailed consultations at the time of preparing development plans. This resulted into failure to prioritize citizen needs.

- There were challenges in aligning entity annual plans to the approved development plans. A sample of ninety (90) activities randomly selected from the annual plans of the sampled entities were traced to the approved development plans and it was observed that only thirty-three (33) activities representing 37% of the total population sampled could be traced back to the approved development plans. The misalignment of the annual budgets and development plans negates the purpose of preparing development budgets since annual priorities are not set from these development plans.

- The study noted that the current monitoring undertaken by the planning entities was un-satisfactory. The monitoring focuses usually on a few capital projects being implemented by the entities and is not regularly and consistently undertaken. In addition, none of the entities had clearly defined monitoring plans and none had undertaken performance evaluations of prior and current development plans. This was attributed to;











4.3.13. Value for Money Audit on Production of Agricultural Statistics by Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF)

Agriculture is a key driver of Uganda’s economy accounting for over 80% of employment, half (50%) of all exports, and one-quarter (25%) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The sector, therefore, requires timely, reliable, and good statistics to enable effective planning, monitoring and evaluation as well as investment, and reporting of business activities. To achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) launched the Agricultural Sector Data Centre and National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) in 2015 to harmonise the production of agricultural statistics in Uganda. The System aimed to ensure that data related to the agricultural sector is accurate, timely, consistent, disaggregated and accessible to facilitate planning and decision-making in MAAIF, other Ministries, Departments and Agencies, and Local Governments as well as facilitating private sector investment decisions.

This audit sought to assess whether Agricultural Statistics produced by MAAIF through the National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) are Relevant, Accurate, Reliable, Timely and Accessible for proper planning, decision making and policy formulation. Below are key findings and conclusions.

i. Status of Implementation of the National Food and Agricultural Statistics System (NFASS) Project

a) Component 1: National Agricultural Data Centre

Underutilized data Centre: It was noted that the data centre was not being utilized in the processing and analysis of data from MDAs, LGs, and MAAIF departments on a day-to-day basis as envisaged at project inception despite being fully equipped. The Ministry, therefore, did not produce any monthly or seasonal statistical products for the duration of operation of the data centre, that is, 2015/16 to 2021/22.

Non-functional TEEAL library: The TEEAL Library was not functional and could not be accessed by potential users. This was attributed to the expiry of the software license which the Ministry had not renewed following its initial purchase. Whereas the TEEAL library which was run by Cornell University was discontinued in 2018, MAAIF did not seek alternative agricultural libraries to support agricultural research and access to statistical resources. This deprives users of vital information that could be utilized for research, planning, and decision-making.











members to the data centre and as such the data centre had remained idle over the period 2020/21-2021/22.

Data and information transfer protocols: Through system inspection and interviews, it was noted that the Agricultural Statistics Division failed to establish data and information transfer protocols which limited the flow of data between the various institutions and the data centre. It was attributed to the inadequate coordination between MAAIF and the respective MDA’s.

c) Component 3: Routine Agricultural Administrative Data Reporting System (RAADRS)

It was noted that the Division had conducted training of agricultural extension workers in 24 out of the 112 districts in the country as of FY 2017/18 citing limited funding. However, the audit observed that UGX 1.95Bn of NFASS funds that would have otherwise been used to train extension staff in all the districts were diverted to the Joint Agricultural Sector Annual Review (JASAR) between 2016/17-2019/20. d) NFASS Pilot study

Data collection from the Sampled Farmers: A pilot study was undertaken without pre-testing the enterprise data collection tools. Additionally, it was noted that, data collected with the enterprise tools in 2019/20 was uploaded to the system (back end) however, at the time of the audit, the data was still in its raw form, not validated, and therefore not analysed. As a result, the Routine data collection from farmers has not taken off.

Data quality on NFASS: It was noted that the data presented on the NFASS website in form of graphs and figures lack attributes of good statistics presentation such as completeness, comprehensiveness, interpretability, coherence and comparability.

ii. Accuracy and Reliability of Agricultural Statistics Produced by the NFASS

a) Validation of source data, intermediate results and statistical outputs: The Audit noted that the statisticians at the Ministry had not maintained an audit trail of any changes that were made to the data during the data processing. Interviews with the DPOs further revealed that they were not involved in the validation of data because it was collected using CAPI and submitted directly to MAAIF.











subsequently piloted the data collection tools in 5 districts in 2019, the results of this exercise had not been published by the time of the audit.

The audit noted that the Agricultural Sector Statistics Committee (ASSC) held two (2) coordination meetings, out of a possible Twelve (12). It was also noted that in FY 2018/19, only three (3) of the seven (7) semi-autonomous agencies attended the meetings, while in FY 2020/21, four (4) of the Seven (7) semi-autonomous agencies attended the meeting.

iv. To ascertain whether the statistics produced and disseminated by the NFASS meet the current and/or emerging needs of stakeholders and users of agricultural statistics.

a) Stakeholder Consultation. The audit noted that key stakeholders like the farmers under the Uganda National Farmers’ Federation, Uganda Meteorological Authority, Uganda Revenue Authority, Bank of Uganda among others were not consulted. b) Emerging needs of Stakeholders. Audit observed that the Ministry generated only production data for 17 key commodities but excluded market and weather data and analysis which is considered key information to support farm production and marketing.

c) Dissemination of Agricultural Statistics

- Lack of an Agricultural Statistics Dissemination Strategy. The MAAIF MPS for FY 2015/16, stated as part of prior year achievements (2014/15), that a draft statistics dissemination strategy had been developed. However, MAAIF did not avail the draft and/or the approved statistics dissemination strategy for audit. As a result, there is no guidance provided by the ministry to agencies producing agricultural statistics.

- Limited dissemination mechanisms. I noted that MAAIF and sector agencies disseminate statistics through the MAAIF statistical abstract and also through their respective websites for access by the different stakeholders. However, only 5 % of the people in rural areas and 21% of the people in urban areas have access to the internet. In addition, only 13% of persons aged 15 years and above were aware of any or some Government online services available irrespective of whether they had used the internet or not.











Ministry Should further prioritise committee meetings and ensure the attendance of all committee members.  Develop data and information transfer protocol between databases of the key stakeholder institutions such as CDO, DDA, UCDA, NAGRI/DB, and NARO to the NFASS system

 Ensure that funds are allocated to activities that are aligned with their respective outcomes.

 Streamline the process of validation to allow for data validation at the districts by Extension workers and DPOs so that errors in the data can be identified and addressed as and when they arise. Prioritise assessments of data demand from farmers and other key stakeholders to ensure that statistical products produced by MAAIF meet the existing and emerging demands of users.

 Finalise the statistics dissemination strategy so as to provide regularised and harmonised channels through which agricultural information is delivered to all key users of agricultural statistics.

Conclusion

The project which was established to set up the NFASS system did not meet all its objectives. This is because the data centre which was established to enable the Agricultural Planning Department to become a central resource for quality and timely agricultural information had not been fully utilised since it was set up in 2015. Furthermore, the system had not been linked to other agricultural data-producing MDAs such as UCDA, CDO, DDA, NARO, and District Local Governments. As a result, MAAIF had not produced monthly, seasonal and annual agricultural statistical products such as Production data, Market data, weather/climate data, and soil quality maps in different regions for the different commodities. MAAIF currently produces only one annual product, that is, the Statistical Abstract. The lack of timely, accurate and relevant agricultural statistics deprives stakeholders of the information they need for proper planning and decision-making.

4.3.14. Follow Up Report on the Status of implementation of Audit Recommendations on the Value for Money Audit on the Regulation of Labour Externalization by the Ministry of Gender Labour and Social Development











The previous audit covered three (3) financial years (FY) starting from 2014/15 to 2016/17. The follow-up thus evaluated progress made by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD) and roles played by other stakeholders such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, parliamentary committee on Gender, Labour and Social Development, Uganda Mission in United Arab Emirates, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Interpol, Joint Intelligence Committee, Workers representatives, migrant workers, Local Governments and the Labour recruitment companies/ agencies, in implementing audit recommendations from 2017 to-date.

Summary of status of implementation of Auditor General’s Recommendations of the Previous Audit Report and actions taken by MoGLSD

It was noted that MoGLSD had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, resulting in improvements in oversight and regulation of Labour Externalization in Uganda. Out of the 15 key audit recommendations made in the AG’s report of 2017,

- 6 (40%) were fully implemented;
- 7 (47%) were partially implemented; and
- 2 (13%) of the recommendations were not implemented

A summary of the status is presented in the Figure 1 below; Figure 4: Summarised status of implementation of audit recommendations

4.3.15. Follow-up Audit Report on the Status of Implementation of Audit Recommendations on the Value for Money Audit on the Management of Wildlife Conservation by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA)

In March 2011, the Office of the Auditor General issued a report on the Management of Wildlife Conservation by the Uganda Wildlife Authority and submitted the report to Parliament. Key issues noted and recommendations made related to Research and Monitoring in Conservation Management, Conservation and Natural Resource Management, Staff welfare and Re-introduction and introduction of extinct species among others.

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) decided to undertake a follow-up of the 2011 audit, aware that the extent to which the Authority addressed the identified performance gaps would lead to better Management of Wildlife Conservation in Uganda.

The previous audit covered three (3) financial years (FY) starting from 2008/2009 to 2010/2011. This included selected conservation areas and focused on the management of wildlife conservation by Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) with the aim of ascertaining whether UWA was managing conservation in protected areas, maintaining park infrastructure and collaborating with other stakeholders in the conservation of wildlife for the benefit of the people of Uganda. The follow-up thus evaluated progress made in implementing audit recommendations from 2011 to-date.

Summary of Status of Implementation of Auditor General’s Findings and Recommendations of the Previous Audit Report and Actions taken by UWA

It was noted that UWA had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, resulting in improved Management of Wildlife Conservation in Uganda. Out of the 24 key audit recommendations made in the Auditor General’s report of 2011,

- 13 (54%) were fully implemented;
- 8 (33%) were partially implemented while ;
- 3 (13%) were not implemented by UWA.

4.3.16. Follow-Up Report on the Status of Implementation of Audit Recommendations on the Value for Money Audit on the Regulation of the Construction Sector by the Ministry of Works and Transport

In December 2015, the Office of the Auditor General issued a report on the Regulation of the Construction Sector by the Ministry of Works and Transport and submitted the report to Parliament. Key issues noted and recommendations made in the said report related to Development of policies, laws and standards, Strengthening and Support to Regulatory and Professional Bodies, Dissemination of policies, laws and standards, Research on Construction Materials, Monitoring of Compliance to Construction standards and coordination of stakeholders among others.

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) decided to undertake a follow-up of the 2015 audit given that the extent to which the Ministry addressed the issues raised would have a bearing on improvements in enforcement of best practices in the construction industry. Further, recommendations were then made with the aim of addressing outstanding issues noted.

Scope of the follow-up

The previous audit covered three (3) financial years (FY) starting from 2012/13 to 2014/15. The follow-up thus evaluated progress made by Ministry of Works and Transport coordination with Key stakeholders in implementing audit recommendations from 2015 to-date.

Summary of Auditor General’s findings and recommendations of previous audit report and actions taken by Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT)

The Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) had made efforts to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, resulting in improvements in oversight of the Construction Sector in Uganda. Out of the 10 key audit recommendations made in the AG’s report of 2015,

- 3 (30%) were fully implemented;
- 4 (40%) were partially implemented and
- 3 (30%) of the recommendations were not implemented

4.3.17. Value for money audit report on management of piped water systems in rural areas of uganda by Ministry of Water and Environment

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right, and is an important health and development aspect at global, national, regional and local levels. Access to water is described as availability of at least 20 liters of water per person per day within a radius of one kilometer of the user’s dwelling. One of the strategic objectives of the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE) is to increase water supply coverage in the rural areas while ensuring equity by providing at least each village with one safe and clean water source, and where it is technically feasible with piped water options.











selected piped water schemes in rural areas in a timely and effective manner. The audit covered four financial years from 2018/19 to 2021/22 whereby 3 projects covering 18 water schemes out 6 projects with 23 water schemes were assessed.

Below is a summary of key findings and recommendations.

During the period under review of 2018/19 to 2021/2022, the Ministry of Water and Environment implemented a total of six projects with 23 piped water schemes. Of these 23 schemes, 11 were completed while 12 were still ongoing. In addition, The Ministry’s access to safe rural water stagnated at 68% for three out of the four years under review ended 30 th June 2022. The stagnation was attributed to the growing population and the inability to provide infrastructure to meet the growing water demand. The following were noted;

- There was no evidence of review of the plans and feasibility studies before commencement of construction works. Planning documents relating to the three (3) projects with eighteen (18) water schemes selected for audit were not availed to the audit team for review.

- Despite the absence of the planning documents, indications of inadequate planning were revealed through the review of implementation documentation. The significant variances in the actual and targeted number of beneficiaries, occasioned by the delayed plan approvals before actual implementation of the schemes, were noted. This further indicated that there was no project re-appraisal undertaken by management to validate the targets. As a result, there were variations in contract works and contract prices amounting to UGX 14.358 billion.

- There were delays in implementation of water supply schemes. Fourteen (77.7%) of the eighteen schemes were delayed and had extensions of up to four years. The delay in implementation was attributed to the delays in commencement of construction works by contractors of up to 5 months, delayed payment to contractors for certified works by over four months, affecting their cash flows; internal borrowing of project funds of up to UGX5.7 Billion to implement activities outside the approved work plans; and delays resulting from the restrictions under the Covid19 Pandemic. Furthermore, the delays were a result of the delays in acquisition of project land, among others. The overall project delays have since resulted into increased interest costs charged by supervisors and contractors of up to UGX 3.2 billion.

- There were inadequacies in regard to the monitoring and evaluation undertaken by the monitoring and evaluation unit at the Ministry of Water and Environment. The M&E activities were not frequently undertaken, actual monitoring visits were not undertaken as planned, and absence of contract management reports for management decision making purposes. Consequently, the use of substandard materials/equipment to implement the piped water schemes by contractors were not timely identified; and delays by the contractors to implement monitoring recommendations and supervisory instructions were not followed. These affected the overall quality of service delivered to the citizens and are likely hinder overall project sustainability.

- The annual national average of the functionality of water supply systems averaged at 83.5% over the four years. Whereas this was a good measure of performance,











the incidents of limited functionality on some water schemes were noted which resulted from inadequacies in the maintenance and repairs of the schemes, occasioned by limitations in revenue collection, inadequate actual water connections in relation to the planned targets, vandalism of water system infrastructure, and affordability of the water services by the communities, among others. These challenges if not addressed are likely to hinder the sustainability of the schemes and the overall failure by Government to attain the desired levels of quality water accessibility to the citizens in the rural areas.

The Ministry of Water and Environment should;

 Ensure that filing of planning and other related records is properly managed by considering going digital to enable easy accessibility to those records to foster assessment or project appraisals at any level when required.

 Ensure adequate reviews of projects plans or project re-appraisals are undertaken before commencement of projects which take longer to commence following long lead times before accessing funding. In addition, payments to contractors should be synchronized with planned cash flow releases for the schemes implementation.

 Assess the viability of the initial feasibility studies and project designs and make timely revisions where necessary. This would reduce on the increased project costs resulting from delays and variations taking place during project implementation.

 Undertake adequate monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the water supply schemes. In addition, preliminary project activities, such as; identification of sites, water quality and quantity of sources, compensation of project Affected Persons (PAPs), and acquisition of land, among others, should be undertaken prior to handover of construction sites to contractors. Furthermore, Accounting Officer should ensure timely payment of contractors; implement activities according to approved budgets, and frequent discussion of monitoring and supervision reports to ensure snags are rectified in a timely manner.

 Liaise with Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to source for sufficient funds to monitor and supervise activities for increased functionality and sustainability of the water supply schemes.











activities, as well as inefficiencies in operations and maintenance of the rural water supply schemes, have stagnated the performance of the programme. These have been occasioned by delays in land acquisition, vandalism of the water system infrastructure, limitations in affordability of the service, inadequate monitoring and contract management, among others.

It is hoped that with the appropriate stakeholder engagement, closer monitoring and policy review, among others, the inadequacies in the rural water sub-sector will be reduced to enable the country benefit from effective and timely access to safe water.

ANNEXURES ANNEXURE I: SUMMARY OF ENTITY FINDINGS AND OPINIONS FOR MDAs, COMMISSIONS, STATUTORY CORPORATIONS AND STATE ENTERPRISES AND PROJECTS

No. SECTOR AND ENTITY SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS				
AGRICULTURE SECTOR				
  Out of the approved budget of UGX.196.099Bn expected from the Donors, UGX.145.885Bn was available for spending, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.50.214Bn (26%). Further, of the expected UGX.0.700Bn GOU co-funding, UGX. 0.699Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.001Bn representing 99.8% performance.Out of the total available funds of UGX.145.885Bn, UGX. 84.520Bn was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.61.365Bn representing an absorption level of 57.93%. This affected implementation of activities.I sampled four (4) activities worth UGX 63.061Bn and assessed the extent to which these had been implemented. Out of the 4 activities; two (2) activities were partially implemented, while 2 activities were not implemented. This affected service delivery.I noted a number of shortcomings from my inspections such as delayed works, incomplete structures, un-utilised agro processing facilities all of which affected service delivery.I noted avoidable expenditure on the procurement of M-Cash Uganda Limited as an E-Voucher management agency at a cost of UGX.6.8Bn. In addition, there was delayed operationalization of the M-cash electronic payment platform for eight (8) months due to the failure by MAAIF to integrate this financial inclusion system to the NITA‘s payment gateway in time leading to farmers and agro dealers failure to transact during this period.There was failure to refund unutilized balances to farmers, Agro-dealers and MAAIF by UBA to the tune UGX.8.8Bn on termination of their contract.1. The Agriculture Cluster Development Project (ACDP)UnqualifiedOpinion				
				
2. Seed Certification ProjectUnqualifiedOpinion			 The Project had six objectives which were supposed to have been fully achieved by 30th June 2022. As of this date, one (1) had been fully implemented, three (3) were partially implemented and two (2) had not been implemented at all.	
				
			 At the beginning of the year under audit (1st July 2021), the Project had a balance of UGX.938,133,721 from the	
			previous financial year 2020-2021 which was not utilized during the year. By 30th June 2022, all the funds were	
			still on the Project account.	
 The Project planned to receive UGX.3.5Bn GOU counterpart funding, out of which UGX.3.44Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.06Bn (1.7%). Further, out of the budgeted UGX.39.8Bn donor funding, UGX.39.71Bn was availed for spending, resulting in a shortfall of UGX 0.09Bn (0.2%).3. Agriculture Vector Control Project (AVCP)UnqualifiedOpinion				
				




355











Out of the total available funds for the financial year of UGX.39.71Bn, only UGX.38.33Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1.38Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. Out of the 64 activities worth UGX.39.8Bn sampled; 28 activities representing 44% were fully implemented, 29 activities representing 45% were partially implemented while 7 activities representing 11% were not implemented.Physical inspection of three (3) construction projects worth UGX.22Bn namely; Irrigation Scheme in Acomai, National Metrology Laboratory at UNBS and holding grounds at Gwot Apwoyo Zonal Animal Disease control center revealed that works were behind schedule which will result in delayed service delivery to the citizens.There was only one Multi-sectoral Steering committee sitting during the year out of the mandatory two (2) which is a major internal control weakness and exposes the Project to performance challenges such as delays in project implementation and unsatisfactory quality of works among others					
4.	National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO)			NARO budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2.834Bn during the year, however, UGX.3.097Bn was collected, representing a performance of 109% which was partly attributed to the low NTR projections set for the entity by MoFPEDOut of the approved budget of UGX.110.608Bn, UGX.109.089Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of	
					
	Opinion				
	Unqualified			UGX1.519Bn (1.37%) which affected the implementation of activities. All the warrants given to the entity were utilized.I assessed the implementation of a sample of seven (7) outputs with a total of sixteen (16) activities worth	
					
				UGX.50.655Bn. Out of the seven out-puts 3 outputs with four (4) activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.158Bn	
				were fully implemented and 4 outputs with twelve (12) activities worth UGX.48.497Bn were partially implemented.	
				 Funds to the tune of UGX.0.093Bn were mischarged from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent	
				on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.	
				 I undertook field inspections and noted that a number of project works were behind schedule which resulted into	
				delayed service delivery.	
				 90 pieces of land owned by the entity were not recorded in the fixed assets register on IFMS while 17 pieces had	
				encumbrances. In addition, 14 pieces lacked titles, while titles for 4 pieces had not been transferred from the	
				previous owners. Similarly, titles for 15 pieces of land had not been transferred in joint custody of ULC.	
				 The entity had unsettled domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 amounting to UGX 2.58Bn.	
				 Out of the approved staff structure of 995 staff, only 836 positions were filled leaving a balance of 159 (16%)	
				vacant.	
				 Review of management of IT investments revealed several shortcomings i.e. lack of specific structures that steer	
				and oversee ICT implementation, inadequately filled ICT staff establishment (58%), limited awareness of the	
				approved ICT policy and guidelines by staff and lack of documented systematic business continuity or disaster	
				recovery testing, reporting and maintenance procedures.	




356











 Out of the approved budget of UGX. 2.4Bn, UGX. 2.1Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX 0.3Bn (11.6%).I sampled out twelve out-puts and noted that eleven (11) outputs worth UGX.1.5Bn were fully implemented while one (1) output worth 0.6Bn was partially implemented.The entity received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.0.513Bn which was never declared to the PSST.Out of the approved staff structure of 37 staff, only 19 positions were filled leaving a balance of 18 (49%) vacant.5. Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU)UnqualifiedOpinion					
					
					
Unqualified6. Resilience Project (RPLRP)Opinion				 Out of the budgeted UGX.23.9Bn for donor project activities, only UGX.14Bn was available, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.9.8Bn representing 41% of the budget. Further, only UGX.0.65Bn was warranted out of the UGX.1.0Bn GOU co-funding resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.35Bn representing 35% of the approved budget.	
					
					
					
				 Out of the total available funds of UGX.14.03Bn; UGX.13.22Bn was spent by the Project resulting in an unspent	
				balance of UGX0.81Bn representing an absorption level of 94.2%.	
				 Of the 4 quantified activities worth UGX.12.4Bn assessed; 2 activities representing 50% were fully implemented	
				while 2 activities representing 50% were partially implemented.	
				 I noted inadequacies in service delivery in form of delayed works and incomplete livestock marketing and	
				production infrastructure i.e. handover for construction of four (4) sites was delayed between 8 to 16 months and	
				two (2) sites were yet to be completed despite project closure, hence requiring GOU funding interventions.	
				 Out of the total expected loan amount of USD 40Mn only USD. 36.297Mn was received during the project life cycle	
				resulting in un-disbursed loan proceeds of USD 3.703Mn (UGX.13.9Bn) representing 9.3% of the loan amount and	
				as a result Government of Uganda will have to pay back the loan in full including funds that were never disbursed	
				for Project activities which reflects a loss to Government.	
 The approved project budget for donor funds was UGX.24.23Bn however UGX.25.13Bn was availed for spending, resulting in an excess of UGX 0.908Bn (3.7%). On the other hand, the approved GOU budget was 0.5Bn out of which UGX.0.398Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.102Bn which was 20% of the approved budget.Out of the total funds available from both donors and Gou of UGX 25.52Bn, UGX 8.897 was absorbed resulting in unspent balances of UGX 16.62Bn. This represents absorption of only 35% of the funds available.I observed that out of the 34 activities worth UGX.5.327Bn assessed; 14 activities- 41% were fully implemented, 15 activities-44% were partially implemented, while 5 activities-15% were not implemented.I noted shortcomings that affect service delivery for the citizens such as; failure to maintain demonstration gardens, delayed approval of District Nutrition Action plans, delayed release of funds to Districts, and unutilised funds at the Districts.7. Uganda Multi-Sectoral Food Security and Nutrition Project (UMFSNP) – Grant NO. P149286

 There was no meeting held by the inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee during the year.				
8. National Animal Genetic Resources Centre & Data Bank (NAGRIC & DB)UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.1.56Bn, UGX.2.629Bn was realised, representing a performance of 169%. This was attributed to the entity NTR budget projections way below probable revenue sources.	
				
			 Out of the budgeted UGX.73.362Bn, UGX.72.762Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.6Bn	
			representing 0.82% of the budget. The Shortfall affected implementation of activities	
			 I reviewed the implementation of a sample of two outputs with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX.7.5Bn. I	
			noted that; 1 output with one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX.2Bn was fully implemented while 1 output	
			with 3 activities worth UGX.5.5Bn was partially implemented. As a result, the entity did not finalise establishment	
			of fish feed plant and animal feed production, processing, packaging and storage facilities on Centre farms.	
			 UGX.0.470Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted for and spent on other activities	
			without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.	
			 I noted challenges in regard to service delivery mainly resulting from delays and non-performing contracts.	
			 I noted shortcomings in the management of land owned by the entity which included encumbrances on 5 pieces	
			of land, lack of land titles for all 16 entity pieces of land, failure to transfer all the sixteen (16) land titles into the	
			name and custody of the Uganda Land Commission, unutilized pieces of land.	
			 The entity had outstanding arrears to the tune of UGX.1.31Bn which was an increment of 4.5% from the prior year	
			arrears balance of UGX.1.25Bn	
			 There was loss of 920 cattle, 521 goats and 1 pig estimated at UGX.0.33Bn through death and theft leading to	
			loss of government biological assets and thus Government revenues.	
			 I observed that letters of credit opened as far back as 2018/2019 had not performed which continued to affect	
			progress of works and service delivery.	
			 I noted that the entity management was not adhering to the approved staff structure during recruitment. Some of	
			the positions were over filled while others were under-filled. In addition, 17 staff had been in acting positions for	
			more than six months which was irregular.	
			 I noted shortcomings in the management of IT Investments i.e. delays to implement the procured IT system,	
			failure to dispose IT hardware equipment, inadequate Internal Audit review of the ICT systems that produce	
			financial statements, lack of an approved IT risk management framework/policy and lack of a business continuity	
			plan.	
			 Withholding tax to the tune of UGX.0.33Bn from payments worth UGX.6.25Bn was not recovered from service	
			providers.

Out of the Donor budget of UGX.39.29Bn, only UGX.21.15Bn was availed for spending resulting in a shortfall of UGX.18.14Bn representing 46%. Further, of the UGX.4.897Bn GOU co-funding, only UGX.4.647Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.25Bn representing 5.1%.Out of the total available funds for the year of UGX.26.659Bn, only UGX.15.366Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.11.293Bn representing an absorption level of 58.5%. As a result of under-absorption, a number of planned activities were not implemented by the project which affected service delivery.Out of the sampled 88 activities worth UGX.9.67Bn assessed; 15 activities representing 17% were fully implemented, 22 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 51 activities representing 58% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement activities affects service delivery.I noted inadequacies in service delivery in form of delayed review of consultancy reports to enable approval of new hubs for oil palm growing by IFAD and delayed hand over of Land for the nucleus estates for oil palm development due to delays in transferring of titles for the acquired land.I noted non-remittance of loan recoveries to the UCF worth UGX.18.4Bn thus delaying implementation of critical government programs. Further, there was non-utilization of reflows to a tune of UGX.29.1bn to fund the National Oil Palm Project (NOPP) in contravention of the tripartite agreement thus denying the citizens benefits accruing.   9.

			 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX. 13.017Bn, only UGX. 13.017Bn was spent by the entity	
			resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.024Bn representing absorption level of 99.99%.	
			 I noted that of the three (3) sampled quantified outputs with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX 1.63Bn; 1	
			output with one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX.0.199Bn was fully implemented and 2 outputs with three

     Out of the approved budget of UGX.11.6Bn, UGX.11.4Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX 0.2Bn (1.7%).I sampled one out-put that was quantified with a total of two (2) activities worth UGX 0.17Bn and noted that this output was not implemented at all.Funds to the tune of UGX.0.031Bn were mischarged from the activities on which they were budgeted to other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.The entity had outstanding domestic arrears to a tune of 283Mn, of which, UGX.186Mn were incurred during the year under review.Out of the 55 pieces of land measuring approximately 20.887 hectares owned by the Authority, 35 pieces of DDA land did not have land titles while 20 titled pieces of land had not yet been transferred in the names of Uganda Land Commission. I further noted that 1 piece of land was not recorded in the entity’s land register and the IFMS fixed assets module, while records for 2 pieces of land were scanty. 30 pieces of land were also not utilized by the entity at the time of Audit.Out of the approved one hundred and thirty-nine (139) posts only eighty-six (86) are filled and fifty-three (53) were vacant representing 38% understaffing.Review of management of IT investments revealed several shortcomings for instance; 5 IT Systems worth UGX.226Mn had no clearance from NITA-U and MoFPED, IT assets and systems procured at a cost of UGX.218.9Mn were not planned for, one IT system was not being utilised among others.I noted that DDA was not levying and collecting Cess on Milk or Milk products and neither did the Authority receive due compensation from the Ministry of Finance.Unqualified				
12. National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS).UnqualifiedOpinion			 NAADS budgeted to collect NTR of UGX. 0.06Bn during the year however; UGX. 0.03Bn was collected, representing a performance of 50%. This was partly attributed to the unrealistic NTR projections due to the non-participation	
			of the entity during the estimation of NTR by MoFPED. Out of the budget of UGX.104.49Bn, UGX. 88.73Bn was warranted resulting in a short fall of UGX.1.519Bn (15.1%). Out of the total warrants of 88.73Bn, UGX 88.45Bn was absorbed representing an absorption level of 99.7%. Funds to the tune of UGX.0.173Bn were mischarged from the activities on which they were budgeted to other	
				
			activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.	
			 Field inspections and document review revealed several shortcomings in service delivery in form of delays for	
			construction works and utilisation of completed facilities.	
			 The entity had unsettled domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 amounting to UGX. 14.353Bn. In addition, the	
			entity had Letters of Credit worth UGX.21.2Bn which did not perform for more than two years.	
			 I noted challenges in the progress of the Atyak sugarcane production project in Northern Uganda due to a number	
			of challenges such as adverse weather and field conditions at the Atiak Site, shortage of seed cane within the	




360











				proximity of the sites, fire outbreaks destroying substantial acreage of the plantation and the decision to	
				temporarily halt the operations in a bid to mechanise the process.	
				 Out of the approved staff structure of 56 staff, only 50 positions were filled leaving a balance of 6 (10.7%) vacant.

13.	Out of the approved budget of UGX.254.12Bn, UGX.201.35Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.52.66Bn representing a 21% of the budget.Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.201.35Bn, only UGX.196.54Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.4.81Bn representing an absorption level of 97.6%. As a result of failure to utilize warrants; Pension and gratuity arrears continued to accumulate, 0.29Mn cashew Nut seedlings were not procured and Staff houses at FTI and BAC were not renovated.I noted that out of the 30 outputs sampled with a total of 83 activities worth UGX.55.7Bn; 18 outputs with 49 activities and expenditure worth UGX.23.1Bn were fully implemented; 10 outputs with 32 activities worth UGX.31.9Bn were partially implemented that is; 20 activities were fully implemented, 11 activities were partially implemented while 1 activity remained unimplemented and 2 outputs with 2 activities worth 0.7Bn were not implemented at all.UGX.1.36Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approval.There was inadequate delivery of services to the citizens as highlighted by delays in construction of infrastructure projects (Dams, valley tanks, irrigation schemes), delayed delivery of vaccines and tractors, delayed distribution of tractors and failure to utilise well drilling rigs.I noted shortcomings in the management of Public Land for instance; failure to record land pieces in the assets register and GFMIS fixed asset module, encumbrances on 27 pieces of land through encroachment, lack of land titles for 59 pieces of land, non-quantification of planned land for acquisition, non-involvement of ULC in land acquisition, failure to transfer 4 land titles into the name and custody of the ULC, unutilised pieces of land, lack of land lease register and Irregular allocation of Land by District Land Boards.The entity had outstanding arrears to the tune of UGX.11.46Bn which was an increment of 4.% from the prior year arrears balance of UGX.11.03Bn.  Ministry of Agriculture, Animal, Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF).UnqualifiedOpinion

Notably, it was observed that the core departments of crop resources, animal and Fisheries directorates are significantly affected.

- Management of Pension and Gratuity at the Ministry revealed several anomalies i.e. Failure to budget for Pension arrears, delayed access of pensioners to the pension Payroll, Unreconciled Pension payroll register and pension interface file and Payment of unverified Residual Pension Arrears.

- Review of the “Development of a Sustainable Cashew Nut Value Chain Project” revealed incomplete Project approvals thus irregular implementation by the ministry and non-alignment to the Public Investment Plan. As a result, there was noted failure to achieve the Project Mandate despite availability of Funds.

- Shortcomings were noted in the Asset Management Structure at the Ministry for instance poor state of stores.

- The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.22.43Bn during the year under review but realized UGX.31.64Bn representing a performance of 141% of the target.

1. The Industrial Court of UgandaUnqualifiedOpinion			 The Court did not have a strategic plan to facilitate preparation of annual work plans and the achievement of the NDP objectives.	
				
			 I noted that all the three (03) quantified activities assessed worth UGX.2.095Bn were partially implemented. A review of the financial statements revealed that the Court reported under the statement of financial position payables amounting to UGX. 247,000,000. These related to unpaid sundry creditors in the period under review.	
				
				
			 There are conflicting provisions between the Employment Act, 2006 and the Labour Disputes (Arbitration and	
			Settlement) Act, 2006 on period taken by labour officers to handle labour disputes, the qualifications of both the	
			Labour officers and the Court panellists and their role as quasi-judicial officers were not standardised.

 I assessed the implementation of the case backlog reduction strategy by DGAL and noted that despite the goal of clearing all backlog cases by June 2021, the backlog had only reduced by 63.97%, implying that the zero-backlog goal was not achieved. I also noted that despite various efforts, the case turnaround time has remained stagnant at 30 days for over four financial years with no improvement.I observed that DGAL prioritises new cases over older cases. As a result, backlog cases which have remained unresolved for five (5) years or longer constitute 50% of all the backlog cases of DGAL.Although the Directorate spent UGX.1.05Bn on the operations of the regional laboratories, I noted that the regional laboratories are not sufficiently equipped for forensic analysis and are currently used by Scene of Crime Officers as temporary collection points for samples and exhibits before transferring them to the main laboratory for analysis.I reviewed the management of public land and noted that the entity did not maintain a land register or capture the owned land in the assets register in the Government’s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).I reviewed the management of IT systems and noted that DGAL had a number of IT Governance shortfalls. For instance, there were no structures to oversee ICT implementation, no approved IT staff structure, internal audit did not review ICT systems, and the entity did not have an approved IT risk management framework.				
3. Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS- SWAP).UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the total available funds for the financial year of UGX.106.3Bn, only UGX.76Bn was spent by the Project resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.30.3Bn, representing an absorption level of 71.5%. As a result, I noted	
			that of the 370 activities, ninety (96) were fully implemented, 219 were partially implemented, and 73 were not	
			implemented.I noted that NIRA issued birth certificates to 42,216 children born to refugees out of the planned 50,000. Whereas	
			NIRA had planned to cover six (6) refugee sites, the issuance was only done in three (3) refugee sites. This affected	
			service delivery.	
			 Whereas a sum of UGX.86,754,847 was spent on reviewing stalled cases to enable the affected citizens to obtain	
			national IDs, only 2,498 cases were reviewed out of the planned 7,122 cases.	
			 The Judicial Service Commission procured furniture and a motorcycle worth UGX.35,842,000 for use by the regional	
			offices of Arua and Mbarara. At the time of audit these offices had not been operationalised, implying that the

- There were delays by the Office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution to complete the construction of four (4) Resident State Attorneys’ offices in Kibuku, Sironko, Kyegegwa and Bulambuli, which delayed the deconcentration of services by the ODPP.

- Uganda Police faced the following service delivery issues, whereas UPF planned to conclude investigations for 3000 cases backlog and a total budget of UGX.750,000,000 was allocated, UPF only received UGX.318,000,000. I was not availed with the report showing the actual number of cases investigated and concluded using the available funds.

- Whereas UPF planned to investigate and complete 7000 cases of sexual gender-based violence crimes using a budget of UGX.350,000,000, with 92% of the budgeted funds released only 10% of the planned cases were investigated.

- The construction of the Bunyangabu Justice Centre by UPF, a project worth UGX.1.7Bn has experienced delays due to insufficient and delayed availability of funds. At the time of audit only UGX.920 Million had so far been released, implying that the project completion deadline of October 2022 could not be achieved.

- I noted that the JLOS House construction project is experiencing funding shortfalls. The project, whose value is UGX.245Bn has only received funding worth UGX.31Bn, which is 12% of the estimated project cost. There is a risk that inadequate funding could affect the Project's timely completion.

- The Law Development Centre, through the Legal Aid Clinic, offers Clinical Legal Education to Bar course students and provides legal aid services to indigent (needy) persons. The initiative faces challenges, including limited geographical spread, staffing shortfalls, funding challenges and incomplete or inaccurate data and information.

- The Ministry of Justice undertook to construct the Soroti regional offices, and UGX.511.28 Mn was availed however, during the audit. The construction had not yet commenced.

- I reviewed the call centre's operations at NCIC and noted that the call centre only offers daytime services, which may affect service to Ugandans in the diaspora. In addition, there is no budget provision in the JLOS SWAP project, and the call centre is operated by temporary staff, increasing the risk of service disruptions if they resign without notice.

- Whereas the UHRC had planned to hold 200 regional tribunal hearings for human rights violations, and a sum of UGX.73,949,000 was spent, I observed that the tribunal only held 50 out of the 200 planned hearings.

- During the Financial year, URSB planned to equip the innovation hub and national copyright resource centre. Project funds amounting to UGX.70,000,000 were released. However, only UGX.35,000,000 was spent on the acquisition of projectors and laptops for the purpose. By the time of audit, the hub had not yet been set up, and management explained that they were waiting to relocate to the newly constructed offices.

- URSB planned to integrate the entities systems with other e-government platforms, such as the national identification database of NIRA and the Motor Vehicle register maintained by the Uganda Revenue Authority. Although UGX.260,000,000 was released for the purpose, the integration was not achieved resulting in the failure to attain the planned outcomes.

				 Under the JLOS SWAP project, MoLG planned to print 100,000 copies of the local council register and to undertake	
				training of Local Council I, II, and III Courts in 30 Local Governments. Only 48,000 copies out of the 100,000	
				copies were printed, while training was only 53% (7,980) of the target number of training were conducted.	
				 I noted a misalignment in the construction of prisons. Whereas the JLOS SWAP project provides funding for the	
				construction of prison wards, there is no concurrent funding for the construction of staff quarters, even when	
				prisons cannot operate without staff.	
				 I noted cumulative and persistent underfunding of the project. Over a period of three (3) years, the total approved	
				budget has been UGX.337Bn however, UGX.219Bn has been availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.118Bn.	
				 I further noted that of the availed UGX.219Bn in the last three financial years, the entities have failed to absorb	
				UGX.43Bn. Under absorption affects the timely delivery of services.	
				 I noted that the project does not have a detailed risk assessment policy, risk-management guidelines and risk	
				register as required under the Treasury Instructions. As a result, all project-specific risks may not be assessed in	
				time, and robust risk management and mitigation measures implemented. In addition, risk management	
				procedures may not be well coordinated and consistently applied across all of the JLOS SWAP implementing	
				entities.	
				 I noted delays in completing construction projects in eight (8) implementing entities. The Accounting Officers	
				attributed the delays to late or partial release of funds, failure to complete procurement processes on time and	
				disruptions due to the Covid pandemic in some cases.

I noted the 165 outputs/activities worth UGX.17.327Bn were fully implemented. The entities implemented the activities (100%) within these outputs, 220 outputs/activities worth UGX. 37.945Bn were partially implemented, 122 outputs/activities worth UGX.18.9952Bn were not implemented at all.During the financial year 2020/2021, the JLOS SWAP project provided funding amounting to UGX. 8,507,209,099 for constructing twenty-two (22) infrastructural development projects across the entire sector and country. A review of the project progress revealed that four (4) projects for which UGX. 2,570,000,000 was released during the year have experienced delays or stalled.Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS- SWAP). 2021UnqualifiedOpinion

Despite the strategic goal of clearing all backlogs, various entities still report outstanding/pending cases of backlog, and in some instances, the backlog has increased rather than reduced.The JLOS SWAP project depends on development partners to finance most of the budgeted activities. In the financial year 2020/2021, Development Partners directly contributed a total of UGX.16.5Bn. Of this, UGX.14.1Bn or 85% was contributed by the Embassy of Netherlands,1.69Bn by UNFPA, 0.52Bn by UNICEF, and 0.15Bn by DGF. Also, some donors contributed through budget support. For instance, EUR. 2,000,000 by Austria, EUR. 6,000,000 by European Union, EUR. 6,500,000 through Dutch support, which approximately totaled UGX. 55.8Bn.

			421 in the year 2022. In addition, only 78% of the victims are rescued and freed. The increase poses a security	
			threat to the citizens and increases public outcry.	
			 The Ministry does not maintain a centralised database with statistics and detailed information relating to trafficking	
			in persons despite receiving a donation of the software from the IOM. This makes it difficult to design interventions,	
			plan for victims’ support and link trafficking cases across different regions of the country.	
			 There are currently no reception shelters for accommodating the victims of trafficking in persons in the country,

			 I assessed the performance of the police Canine unit and noted that; the police dogs are concentrated in the

			 I noted that the dogs’ medical requirements are not sufficiently addressed due to an insufficient number of	
			veterinary staff, insufficient transportation facilities and poor housing for the dogs.	
			 I assessed the performance of the forensics unit and noted that the unit does not have a Laboratory Information	
			Management System and an automated exhibit tracking system. Analysis shows that there was an increase in the	
			backlog of cases in the Forensic unit.	
			 I observed overcrowding at the UPF’s enrolment and distribution centre for Certificates of Good Conduct. This was	
			attributed to the increased demand for the certificates. For instance, the number of certificates issued increased	
			by 170% from 31,671 in 2020 to 85,664 in 2021. There is need to establish more enrolment centres and	
			decentralise the operations.	
			 I reviewed the performance of investigation by the CID and noted that only 56% of cases were investigated and	
			concluded, leaving a backlog of 316,667 cases. This was partly attributed to low levels of automation in the	
			investigation process, limited technical and financial support, and human resource challenges such as insufficient	
			training.	
			 I reviewed the performance of the Express Penalty Scheme and noted an increasing trend of unpaid tickets for	
			fines issued over three (3) years. The analysis revealed that out of the 1.77 million tickets issued in the last three	
			financial years, 700,000 tickets worth UGX.94Bn were still unpaid at the time of audit. This was attributed to	
			weaknesses in the enforcement of payment of traffic fines. Some offenders are untraceable, with no permanent	
			addresses; others are foreigners, and yet there is no policy on enforcement procedures, especially for such	
			defaulters.

- I noted that there were challenges with the registration of minors, including registration of births outside of homes. The challenges were; the capture of incorrect and incomplete information and cultural practices of not naming children immediately at birth

- I observed that there was no harmonization and interface of NIRA systems with other government agencies and enterprises.

- I noted congestion at registration and card issuance centres especially in the Kampala metropolitan area, with over 41% of total issued cards being issued within this area.

- I noted challenges in customer service management, such as lack of dedicated staff to handle customer complaints, staff deployed in the call centre not being trained in customer service, and lack of a manual or automated register of complaints received from walk-ins to enable their tracking up to their resolution, no dedicated staff to handle online platforms and no support offered for clients who seek clarification during weekends and on days when there are national events at Kololo airstrip.

- There were weaknesses noted in the management of the joint venture arrangement with USPC, including; failure to issue call-off orders for blank cards, delays in implementing and installing new systems under the joint venture and irregular pricing of supplies and services under the joint venture.

- I noted that there was no strategy and plan regarding the transfer and migration of processed and stored data, process flows, biometric data scope and timing, among others which may lead to interruptions in the normal operations in the production of IDs, security and preservation of data integrity and delayed delivery of expected outputs under the Joint venture.

- I noted a number of governance issues related to the management of ICT investments, including understaffing of the ICT department, no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, no risk register, and no approved business continuity plan and disaster recovery in place.

- I assessed the road map for the Mass Registration and Mass Renewal of National IDs and noted that there was no clear implementation strategy on when the new IDs are to be rolled out during the mass renewal and mass registration, major contracts for supplying the blank cards, IT systems, equipment and staff to manage the exercise were yet to be rolled out.

- I noted Non-Compliance aspects in the acquisition of ICT solutions and equipment, such as the development of a website with online services without clearance from NITA-U, an online booking system and website developed without business cases, an online booking system not being utilized by the entity and some modules not being used by the entity such as the alien registration, verification of Payment Registration Numbers (PRNs) and ID renewal modules under the NSIS, the electronic data storage for Human Resource Management Information System and the registration module for CRIMS.

I noted that there was no strategy and plan regarding the transfer and migration of processed and stored data, process flows, biometric data scope and timing, which may lead to interruptions in the normal operations in the production of IDs, security and preservation of data integrity and delayed delivery of expected outputs under the Joint ventureI noted that the entity is understaffed, with only 423 positions filled out of an approved structure of 865 staff, resulting in a shortfall of 442 (representing 49%). Key positions like Director ICT, manager Human Resources, Manager Public Relations and Senior Accountant were vacant at the year-end. This leads to the underachievement of planned activities due to an overload of existing staff.

 I noted that despite the company making a profit of UGX.1,638,416,786 in the year under review and UGX.1,470,968,482 in the previous financial year, the company did not propose any dividend pay-out as a form of return on Government investment. I further noted that the Company has not paid any dividends to Government for the previous years.				
3. Kiira Motors Corporation.UnqualifiedOpinion			 KMC had an approved budget of UGX.218,200,839,000 which was all availed during the year. Out of this, the entity absorbed UGX.65,215,742,112 which was only 30% of the funds availed. This affected the implementation of planned activities (all the three outputs planned for the year were partially implemented).	
				
			 The entity had an un-recovered long outstanding receivable of UGX.8,489,374,688 from Makerere University which	
			remained outstanding for more than eight years.	
			 The entity bought 518 hectares of land without notifying Uganda Land Commission and without obtaining approval	
			for purpose of the land from the Uganda land Commission which contravened Section 49 (b) of the Land Act. I	
			further observed that part of this land had encumbrances in form of squatters.	
			 KMC does not have adequate ICT business continuity and disaster recovery measures in the event of ICT systems	
			failure and disruptions.	
 I reviewed the statement of cash flows and noted figures in several account areas totalling to UGX.11Bn that were inconsistent with the statement of financial performance and were not supported with ledgers. I could not carry out reconciliations between the figures in the Statement of Financial Performance and those in the statement of cash flows due lack of proper underlying records. As a result, I could not verify the accuracy of the figures reported in the statement of cash flows and the statement of financial performance.A review of the summary of Budget Performance and the Statement of Appropriation Account (Based on Nature of Expenditure) indicates that the company spent UGX.1.213Bn on fixed assets during the financial year. However, a review of the additions in the schedule of fixed assets, indicated that UGX.2.025Bn was spent on asset additions during the year. This led to a discrepancy of UGX.812Mn between the summary of budget performance and the statement of appropriation, and the fixed asset schedule amount in respect of asset additions. I was not provided with ledgers to enable reconciliations of the amounts. These inconsistencies cast doubt on the accuracy of the information presented concerning the expenditure on fixed assets.I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources, and rates charged at the entity level for the financial year 2020/2021 and noted that out of the UGX.2.757Bn budgeted to be collected in the year under review, only UGX.0.295Bn was collected during the year representing 11% of the budget. Such a performance on NTR collection Whereas a Trial Balance was presented in the financial statements as the basis for the account balances disclosed, I noted that the ledgers required to show the build-up of figures in the Trial Balance were incomplete. I further noted that the expenditure ledgers for Government subvention funds were inconsistent with the ones used to record expenditure of revenue from sales. I was therefore unable to confirm the correctness of the build-up of the figures in the Trial Balance, which was the basis for preparation and presentation of the financial statements.4.

During the audit, I was not provided with details of output during the period, but my anaysis of revenue reported during the year shows only UGX.295Mn was attained against a budget of UGX.2.757Bn. This implies the plant is grossly under utilised.Of the UGX.295Mn that was reported as collections from operations, only UGX.99Mn was banked. Out of the unbanked revenue of UGX.196Mn, only UGX.153.9Mn was accounted for in form of cash payments leaving a balance of UGX.42Mn unaccounted for. There is a risk that this amount was not put to proper use.PIBID lacked land titles for its land at Sanga (approximately 50 acres) and land located at Kyamuhanga (approximately 4 acres) exposing the land to the risk of encroachment and land grabbing.PIBID does not have an approved salary structure on which it pays individual staff. It should be noted that this issue has been re-occurring and Management has not taken action.Contracts totalling UGX.1.228Bn were signed by the entity without the approval of the Solicitor General contrary to Article 119 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended). This exposes government to risks of unfavaourable contractual terms and potential loss. 

However, seven (7) performance indicators in the project year three targets were not achieved.I noted that the implementing partners lacked tangible achievement in implementing their target activities in component 2 across all the districts due to the late engagement process of the implementing partners by DRDIP management and the six months suspension by the IGG.

			 I noted inadequate top-level support in the transition from sector to program approaches to planning and budgeting	
			as only the P/Ss’ of the convening Ministries attend the programme working group (PWG) meetings. The rest were

				 There was slow progress in implementing NDP III Monitoring and Evaluation reforms.	
				 I noted that there was no current 10-year national development plan informing the formulation of the NDP III and

14.	Food Security Increased Rice ProductionEnhancing National Through Project (ENRP) June 2021Opinion	The budget absorption rate for the project during the year under review was 3%, which is considerably low, despite the fact that the project is about to end. This implies that most activities budgeted for were not carried out, which may lead to failure to complete the project in the planned time frame. However, I note that management sought and obtained a no-cost extension for two years from the Islamic development bank, which will enable the project to complete all the planned activities, including the major activity of the dam construction that caters for over 90% of the total project expenditure.

			 The Ministry experienced challenges and delays in the implementation of some activities which affected service	
			delivery.	
			 I observed that the MoLG did not make a budgetary provision for the settlement of court awards and compensation	
			liabilities.	
			 I noted that the Ministry did not have approved selection criteria and allocation guidelines for the allocation of	
			start-up funds to the beneficiary Local Governments. Consequently, the Ministry allocated an arbitrary start-up	
			amount of UGX.50 million to each of the beneficiary local Governments irrespective of the differences in the	
			requirements and size of the newly created administrative units.

			Councils	
			 I noted that despite the submission of the cost implication two years after approval of the creation of cities, the	
			cities are still operating on the budgets of Municipal Councils because they have not yet received funding for city	
			status which hinders service delivery.	
			 I noted that several Districts and Cities had not constituted Service Commissions, while others were functional but	
			not fully constituted.	
			 I noted that the Ministry did not have specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation. There was	
			no approved IT risk management framework/policy, and risk register and there was no business continuity plan,	
			contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014.

			allocated to the High Commission over the five years, mainly for wage and non-wage (recurrent) spending	
			 The approved structure of the High Commission considers only the Head of Mission and the graded as Foreign	
			Service Officers. Other officers who are posted and work at the High Commission such as the Financial and the	
			Administrative Attaches were not included in the approved structure of the High Commission.	
			 I established that the High Commission paid a total of AUD 48,551.57 during the financial without separating what	
			related to normal power use and the portion meant for cooling/heating. This is irregular and affects implementation

			 The Mission budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.9,843,762 which was fully realized representing a performance of	
			100% of the target.

			 The Mission planned to receive UGX.3.712Bn out of which UGX.3.562 was warranted resulting in a shortfall of	
			UGX.150M that represents 4% of the approved budget. The unwarranted funds were meant for Presentation of	
			credentials to Cambodia, Laos-PDR and Myanmar and Commercial diplomacy activities.	
			 I noted that the entity did not seek a revision of its budget, and the work plan as provided for by section 17 (3) of	
			the PFMA 2015.	
			 Out of the total warrants of UGX.3.562Bn received during the financial year under review, UGX.3.53Bn was spent	
			by the entity resulting in an absorption level of 99%.	
			 I assessed the implementation of four (4) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of fifteen (15) activities	
			worth UGX.3.557Bn and noted that all the four (4) outputs with fifteen (15) activities worth UGX.3.557Bn were	
			partially implemented. Out of the fifteen (15) activities, the entity fully implemented eight (8) activities; six (6)	
			activities were partially implemented, while one (1) activity remained unimplemented.	
			 The Mission did not implement some planned activities such as Presentation of Credentials to Cambodia, Laos-PDR	
			and Myanmar, FDI of US $ 27.3M was not attracted to Uganda against the set target of USD 100M, One (1) Bench	
			marking study visit was not coordinated while 10 out of 12 official delegations were not coordinated.	
			 I noted that the Mission did not maintain a detailed risk register of risks which may affect the implementation of	
			activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. There were no strategies and officers responsible	
			to mitigate the occurrence of such risks.	
			 The approved staff Structure of the Mission provides for five (5) staff however, I noted that the Mission is	
			understaffed with a Human Resource capacity of three (3) (60%) Home-based Staff while (2) (40%) positions of	
			FSO 111 and FSO V were not filled. I also noted that the position of FSO 11 that was not provided for in the	
			structure was filled.	
44. Uganda High Commission Lumpur. 2020/21in KualaUnqualifiedOpinion			The Mission had an approved budget of UGX.3.54 Bn that was all released for the financial year 2020/2021. The Embassy planned to achieve its deliverables through implementation of three (03) main outputs worth UGX.3.51Bn, representing 99% of the total budget.The mission did not achieve all the targets set in the mission statement for the period under review. Out of eight (8) strategic activities/targets; four (4) objectives were fully implemented, three (3) were partially achieved while one (1) was not achieved at all by the end of the financial year.	
				
				
			 I noted that the Embassy budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.11.8Million which was all realized representing a	
			performance of 100%.	
			 The Mission budgeted to receive UGX.3,542,140,000 out of which UGX.3,542,139,217Bn was warranted

			was returned to the Consolidated Fund while foreign exchange loss of UGX.115,988,734 was incurred during the	
			period.	
			 Three (03) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.51 were clearly and fully	
			quantified to enable assessment of performance.	
			 I noted that three (03) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX.3.51Bn were partially	
			implemented. Out of fourteen (14) activities, six (6) representing 43% of the activities were fully implemented;	
			three (3) activities (21%) were partially implemented while five (5) activities (36%) were not implemented.	
			 The activities that were not fully implemented included; 10 planned scholarships, Presentation of Credentials to	
			Cambodia, Laos-PDR and Myanmar, 3 bilateral engagements and 12 planned official delegations.	
			 The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 after the deadline given for submission of the	
			reports and the level of performance was consistent with my review of other comparative information and reports.	
45. Uganda High Commission in London.UnqualifiedOpinion			 The Mission continues to experience funding challenges, with several of its planned activities in the strategic plan not adequately funded as planned. Of specific concern is the absence of funding to undertake urgent repairs on the Mission properties (Chancery, Official residence and the Rentable structure on Wardour Street), which continue to increase the eventual repair costs given that they continue to further degenerate with severe weather conditions.	
			The continued underfunding implies that the Mission will face challenges in implementing all the planned activities	
			which may in turn impact on the attainment of the intended goals.	
			 The Mission did not budget to collect any Non-Tax Revenue (NTR) during the year under review, although a total	
			of UGX.769.6Mn was collected. Failure to budget for such NTR implies that there was no target upon which the	
			Mission’s performance could be evaluated.	
			 The Accounting Officer did not appoint contract managers for the procurements worth GBP.113,788 (equivalent	
			to UGX.522Mn) during the year under review. Failure to appoint contract managers is irregular and may lead to	
			challenges in contract implementation going un detected by management, in the absence of close supervision of	
			the performance of such contracts.	
			 The Mission did not procure a medical insurance provider during the year under review, and mission staff would	
			obtain treatment from health facilities and claim refunds upon presentation of receipts. This practice is contrary to	
			the requirements by the public service standing orders.	
46. Uganda High Commission in London. 2020/21UnqualifiedOpinion			 The Accounting Officer did not appoint contract managers for the procurements worth GBP.58,231 (equivalent to UGX.287Mn) during the year under review. Failure to appoint contract managers is irregular and may lead to	
				
			challenges in contract implementation going un detected by management, in the absence of close supervision of the performance of such contracts.The Mission did not procure a medical insurance provider during the year under review, and mission staff would	
				
				
			obtain treatment from health facilities and claim refunds upon presentation of receipts. I further noted some	
			payments for medical bills were not supported by prescriptions from a doctor, as required by the Public Service

			Standing Orders. This practice exposes the Mission to a risk of misuse, since there are no controls regarding the	
			kind of medical attention provided to staff, eligibility, as well as receipts presented by staff.	
The entity did not budget to collect any NTR during the year under review however they were able to collect UGX. 1,127,805. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.4.876Bn out of which UGX. 4.743Bn was warranted, resulting in under funding of UGX.0.133Bn. This represents 2.73% of the approved budget. I assessed the implementation of the one output that had been fully quantified worth UGX.2.546Bn and noted that the output was partially implemented. 47.

In some cases, the indicators were generic and not specific to the activity while in other cases, management did not provide indicators.I noted that the High Commission did not maintain a detailed register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. As such, there were no strategies and officers responsible to mitigate the occurrence of such risks or to minimise the impact in the event that these risks materialised.A review of the statement of arrears of revenues on page 33 of the financial statements revealed that the Mission had cumulative arrears of revenue as at 30 June 2022 of UGX.112,630,169 however the same was not disclosed in the statement of financial position as receivables.53.

  The Mission strategic plan was approved by NPA on 22/November/2021 after close of the financial year. Therefore, the activities implemented during financial year 2020/2021 were not based on the approved strategic plan.The Mission planned to implement four (4) outputs with a total of eight (8) activities and expenditure of UGX.16.43Bn. I noted that all the four (4) outputs were not quantified to enable assessment of performance.The Mission had receivables amounting to UGX.7.452Bn at the close of the financial year, including six (6) tenants who had not paid amounts due for rent totalling USD.0.597Mn. Delayed collection may lead to default and eventual loss of funds.The Mission had deposits amounting to UGX.0.909Bn.

			 The Mission had receivables amounting to UGX.4.681Bn at the close of the financial year including six (6) tenants	
			who had not paid amounts due for rent totalling USD.896,381 as at the end of the financial year. Delayed collection	
			may lead to default and eventual loss of funds.	
			 The Mission had deposits amounting to UGX.0.862Bn. Whereas at the time of collection of rental payments by	
			tenants (which include the refundable deposits) are transferred to the Consolidated Fund as Government revenue,	
			the funds are a liability, returnable to the tenants at the time of expiry of their rental periods, and therefore need	
			to be secured as such.	
 Whereas the mission targeted to handle 200 visa applications, certify 80 documents and hold 5 meetings to coordinate payment of subscription arrears regarding the bureau for international exhibitions, it was only able to handle 124 visa applications, certify 54 documents and coordinate 4 meetings implying variances of 76 applications, 26 certifications and 1 meeting. Failure to achieve the targets implies that the goal of generating revenue through promoting tourism may not be achieved.Although the Mission charter provides for acquisition of property annually, it was noted that no property had been acquired. Instead, the Mission spent Euros 9,000 on rent of the Official residence monthly.At the time of audit inspection the renovation works for the chancery had stalled due to delayed payments dating back to February 2022,and this exposed the Mission to extra monthly costs such as; rent for new59.

Chancery;Euros.21,750, rent for Warehouse; Euros 1,571, security costs and remobilization of workers. Delayed payments may also attract penalties from the Contractor and Consultant. Whereas the country subscribes to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), it has incurred subscription arrears dating as far back as 2014 amounting to Euros 25,0139.34 an equivalent of UGX.101,183,684 as at 31 December 2021. There is a risk of prevention of certification and/or embargo on Uganda Seed exports to the European and other markets.Review of the board of survey report and physical inspection of the mission representation car, utility van and the ICT equipment revealed that though they are due for replacement due to high maintenance costs, this had not been effected.				
60. Uganda Embassy in Paris. 2020/21UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.8.849Bn, UGX.8.203Bn was spent by the	
			embassy resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.669Bn representing an absorption level of 93%. The unspent	
			balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account.  I observed that the mission did not have an approved and certified five-year strategic plan as required. There is	
			a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which	
			negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives.

Although the Mission did not budget for None Tax Revenue (NTR) during the financial year 2021/2022, I noted that the Mission collected UGX.86.2Mn. Failure to budget for such NTR implies that there was no target upon which the Mission’s performance could be evaluated.Out of the appropriated budgeted of UGX.6.923Bn, only UGX.3.465Bn (representing 50% of the budget) was warranted leading to inability by the Mission to undertake the majority of the planned activities. I observed that the released funds could barely cover employee costs and the majority of the planned activities were not funded.I observed that although the Mission in Pretoria has over the years been employing local staff, there was no social security/gratuity scheme for such staff. It was further observed that although a local consultant was engaged, who compiled a valuation of how much is due for all staff (both current and those who exited), the current staff contracts have not been amended to cater for staff gratuity/social security, going forward. Such an omission exposes the Mission to risks of costly litigation and potential sanctions by the host nation. Unqualified61. Uganda Embassy in Pretoria.Opinion

			of these activities.	
			 The entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 after the deadline given for submission of the reports.	
 The Mission delayed to remit cash balances to the Consolidated Fund. I noted that the Mission had total collections including unspent balances in the current year and balance brought forward from previous year totalling to UGX.1.679Bn. At the closur 1 e of the period, UGX.1.348Bn had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.0.331Bn. The practice amounts to a violation of regulations and could lead to misallocation of the Embassy’s funds.I noted that the Assets Register maintained by the Mission was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions, and several asset details were missing. I also noted a number of unserviceable items recommended for disposal in the prior financial year but still remained undisposed at the end of 2020/2021.The Mission owns two chancery buildings in Washington DC. The Board of Survey and an engineering assessment on the buildings disclosed the following among other issues;o The back porch of one of the buildings continued to disintegrate due to an unstable foundation.o The Chancery buildings on plots 5909 and 5911 had shown serious structural cracks ranging from 1mm to 7mm. The landing rear porch of building on plot 5909 had completely failed.o The buildings were susceptible to storm water, which was disastrous to their integrity given that the interior of the buildings was made of wood. The incomplete splash aprons were noted to be allowing water in the buildings.My inspection of the buildings revealed structural issues including corrosion of water pipes, cracks in the buildings, detached chimney on building on 5911 and detached porch on building on plot 5909. The buildings are likely to deteriorate further if no urgent civil works are undertaken, which renders their occupancy by Mission staff and their clients unsafe. Delayed works may also render the repairs more costly.67. Uganda Embassy in WashingtonUnqualifiedOpinion

- The Cabinet on 22nd February, 2021 under minute no. 43 (CT 2021) took a decision to merge UNRA with MoWT. Under the circumstances, there is material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt that the Authority shall remain a Going Concern in the foreseeable future.

- According to the revised approved budget, the entity expected to receive UGX.3,654,658,940,745 out of which UGX.3,150,755,611,035 was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.503,903,329,710 representing 14% of the approved budget.

- Out of the total warrants of UGX.3,150,755,611,035 received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoiced totalling UGX.2,662,030,909,590 resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.488,724,701,445 representing an absorption level 84.5%.

- I assessed the implementation of 13 projects with a total of twenty six (26) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of fifty three (53) activities worth UGX.1,473Bn and noted that; Nine (9) outputs with nineteen (19) activities worth UGX.154Bn were fully implemented, Sixteen (16) outputs with thirty three (33) activities worth UGX.1,285Bn were partially implemented and One (1) output with one (1) activity UGX.34 Bn was not implemented.

- A sum of UGX.136,480,916,768 was spent from various projects to cater for activities that are not related to the respective projects with no evidence of approval from the appropriate authority.

- The entity had contingent liabilities worth 381,799,539,802, Out of which UGX.144,301,631,989 was in-respect of certificates of works, which the Accounting Officer had not yet approved by the close of the year under review.

- The review of expenditure made during the year indicated that UNRA paid out UGX.12,972,532,057 in-respect of interest charges for the Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs) which were not paid in the agreed timelines.

- I under took engineering audit of a selected sample 9 road development, bridge & rehabilitation projects and noted the following;

o Inadequate estimation of quantities for 5 projects audited leading to multiple contract variations.

o Access to sites for 6 out of the 9 projects was not achieved as required by the different contract arrangements.

o Delays in completion of design reviews which delayed timely issuance of instructions to Contractors.

o 8 out of the 9 projects audited were not completed on/in time and had time extensions which delayed the availability of the upgraded roads to the users.

o Payment of interim payment certificates to the contractors were not on time for eight projects under audit.

o I observed there environmental social and health safety concerns on six road projects audited.

o I undertook measurements on some selected items to establish the consistency with which the supervision team accurately measures the quantities before payments and established over payment amounting to UGX.231,870,478.13 & EUR 47,469.01 from different projects.

				directive against the practice for solely Government of Uganda funded projects. USD 11,153,986.05 was paid	
				out to the Contractor at an exchange rate of 1USD at UGX.2,282.1, which meant that Government incurred an	
				extra cost of over UGX.15,448,939,920.88 to acquire this amount of dollars considering the average USD	
				exchange rate was UGX.3667.16 during the contract execution period.	
				o I established that for Mpigi town roads project, a total amount of UGX.2,319,823,581.79 was advanced to the	
				contractor in payment certificates (01 to 07) in regards to materials on site without any contractual basis.

				 I noted that out of the 2,080 land titles that the entity obtained during the financial years 2018/19 to 2021/22,	
				only 102 land titles had been transferred into UNRA’s name resulting into the balance of 1,978 (95%) land titles	
				to still have been in the names of PAPs by the end of the year under review.	
				 During the review of implementation of ICT activities, I noted that the entity did not have a business continuity	
				and disaster recovery plan.	
				 There was delayed completion of 22 road with a total contract value of UGX.82,177,512,239.	
				 There were abandoned Road Works for mechanised maintenance on Busolwe – Nabumali Junction that had been

The contractors delayed to mobilize heavy machinery and equipment for works, slow progress by management to secure a right of way due to slow compensation to people affected by the road project (PAPs) and COVID-19 pandemic whereby the Contractors could not carry out the activities as planned due to restricted movements both local and international.I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired for the entire road having a total length of 191 Km for which compensation had been made is still in process. However, it was not clear how far the process had reached and when it would end, in spite of UNRA Management engaging Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban development (MoLHUD) on this matter. Upgrading of Rwenkunye –Apac – Lira - Acholibur Road Project (252.5 Kms) implemented by Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) for the financial year ended 30 th June, 2021UnqualifiedOpinion

- The Corporation budgeted to collect revenues amounting to UGX.128.96Bn during the year under review but only UGX.16.4Bn was collected, representing a performance of 12.7% of the target.

- The Corporation planned to receive UGX.225.175Bn from GOU sources but only UGX.191Bn was received, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.34.175Bn representing under performance of 34.2%.

- Out of the total funds of UGX.191Bn received during the financial year, UGX.158.69Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.32.31Bn representing absorption level of 83.1%.

- I assessed the implementation of a sample of thirty seven (37) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of seventy eight (78) activities with a budget worth UGX.116Bn and noted that;

- Two (2) outputs with three (3) activities and expenditure worth UGX.372 million were fully implemented.

- Fifteen (15) outputs with forty two (42) activities with expenditure worth UGX.39.6bn were partially implemented. Out of the forty two (42) activities, the entity fully implemented six (6) activities; eighteen (18) activities were partially implemented, while eighteen (18) activities remained unimplemented.

- Twenty (20) outputs with thirty three (33) activities with expenditure worth UGX.3bn were not implemented at all.

- A project for rehabilitation of the Namanve – Tororo Line was undertaken at a contract sum UGX.184,067,631,879 but the majority of the line was undressed and laid back along the stretch, the sleepers are not packed and made firm on the permanent way and there are no ballast stones on the sections worked on the main line. As a result, there were noted cases where trains tipped and derailed on several sections of the railway line.

- Inspection of the project for Construction of the Sleeper making Factory at Kawolo Station at contract sum of EUR.19,840,000 revealed that progress of works was approximately at 55% and land left outside the fence had been encroached.

- Management had not remitted NSSF contributions to a tune of UGX.2,902,946,239 by 30th June, 2022.

- UGX.941,540,000 allocated for the purchase of locomotives under GOU funding was diverted to activities not related to the purchase of locomotives.

- There were accumulated rental arrears for over 12 years from August 2009 to December 2021 of KSH.1,860,153 (UGX.59,152,865) for a URC House located at LRV, Kisumu, 12/252-Tom Mboya Street.

- Out of expected compensation to URC of UGX.34,563,250,000 from UNRA, for takeover of part of the station and railway land reserves, an amount of UGX.6,402,682,500 was paid to URC resulting into a balance of UGX.28,160,567,500. However, there are ligation claims by third parties that the land being compensated did not belong to URC which has hampered the settlement of the obligation by UNRA.

- URC regularly revised its freight rates down to levels that did not seem commercially viable given the prevailing economic circumstances for the year under audit. For example, tariffs for transportation of grain/ conventional cargo on the northern routes were revised to USD 19.6/ton from USD 27.6/ton for Mombasa- Kampala route yet fuel costs which make up the largest part of the cost driver significantly rose over the period.

- A review of an agreement between the Government of Uganda and Mango Tree (U) Ltd to rehabilitate and upgrade the Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba without recourse to public funds revealed that there was no competitive procuring of the private service provider. In addition, whereas Marine Vessel (MV) Pamba operated during the year, there were no arrangements by URC in respect to monitoring of revenue collected by the operator of the vessel and also the revenue sharing terms which would allow both parties to mutually benefit as required in the agreement.

- A financial analysis of the Corporation indicated that it has continuously made losses for the previous two years and that URC still needs to make significant improvements in Operating efficiency, profitability and its ability to sustain provision of services.

- I undertook the review of land management and observed that;

o 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 10.8 hectares out of 281 pieces of land measuring approximately 8,407 hectares (0.13 %) and costing UGX.2,473,324,000 were not recorded in the entity’s land register.

o 13 pieces of land measuring 434.5 hectares valued at approximately UGX.1.732Bn had encumbrances in the form of caveats, court injunctions and encroachment.

o Out of the 281 pieces of land measuring approximately 8,406.94 hectares the entity held, 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 802.9 hectares (4.1%) did not have land titles.

o One (1) piece of land measuring approximately 12.24 hectares (0.15%) worth UGX.55,763,745,000 in Nalukolongo was irregularly subdivided and transferred to several private ownership.

o Land measuring approximately 49.32 hectares was leased out during the period under review, but 7 pieces of land measuring approximately 45.32 hectares were not traceable to the lease register.

o Out of the lease rentals of UGX.132,600,000 expected in the period under review, the entity only received UGX.107,112,000 (81%) by 30th June, 2022 with a balance of UGX.25,488,000 still outstanding.

o The District Land Boards (DLB) across the country, KCCA and ULC without advertising or seeking for consent from URC allocated/leased five (5) pieces of land measuring approximately 45.312 hectares that were not under their jurisdiction.

- I reviewed the implementation of ICT activities and noted that:

o 68 IT equipment procured for UGX.520,935,318 and two IT systems worth UGX.191,785,702 were not cleared by NITA-U.

o Three (3) systems were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with other systems.

o 51 IT equipment valued at UGX.5,057,500 were recommended in board of survey report for disposal but thi shad not been implemented.

o There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation, no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the Corporation, and no risk register.

			o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy	
			2014.	
			 There was an irregular contract variation of UGX.29,535,900 (203% of the contract sum) for construction of 2-

			 There was failure by the entity to dispose of about 21,993 unusable sleepers that had been collected from the	
			dismantled line along the Tororo-Gulu line. These are exposed to theft and loss of value	
I noted that UNRA delayed to pay the Contractor’s Interim Payment Certificate (IPC) within the stipulated days in the contract thereby incurring UGX.609,061,148 and USD.130,733.97 in finance chargesUNRA signed contracts with three companies to relocate utilities along the project road for a total cost of UGX. 5,887,444,880 against a budget amount of UGX. 3 Billion thereby resulting into an additional amount of UGX.2,887,444,880. This is an increase of 96% beyond the budgeted amount for this activity casting doubt to the comprehensiveness of the feasibility studies undertaken by the UNRA and the Contractor before BoQs were made.I noted that the progress of work did not match the remaining period to the completion date. The road works were estimated to be at 68%, the OSBP at 25% and Suam Bridge at 70% with just few months to reach contract completion date.I further noted that some of the project components had not been implemented at the time of audit these include; Training in labor based construction techniques, Refurbishment of a post-crash care center and procurement of theatre equipment.I noted that the contracts signed by the consultants required them to provide the Professional liability insurance of 110% of the contract value but those provided did not cover the entire periodIf there is no Insurance cover as per the PPDA regulations, UNRA will not have a fallback position in case the consultants do not meet their contractual obligations.  8.

			and August 2021, had not been resolved by the time of our audit, 2 years later.I noted that while the contractor was making payments towards obligations in regard to Pay as you earn tax(PAYE) and NSSF, they did not make returns to the relevant statutory bodies as required by law. In some instances	
			the payments were lower than the required amounts. Unpaid taxes deprive government of revenue, while staff	
			deprived of their NSSF savings may resort to legal action.	
			 While UNRA obtained a certificate of no objection for the construction and construction supervision of Hoima Town	
			roads, certificate of no-objection was not obtained for the construction and construction supervision of Masindi	
			and Kigumba Town roads due to delays in approvals by the funders. By the time of audit in September 2022, the	
			contractor was on site and the reported levels of completion for Masindi and Kigumba town roads was 77% roads	
			21% respectively. The contractor had issued a notice of intention to close the site over non-payment for works	
			due to delays in approvals.	
			 I noted that the consultant was yet to complete the designs for the OSBP due to non-harmonization of the designs	
			with those of Rwanda and the DRC at time of audit and there was no proof of communication between the MOFA	
			and authorities in Rwanda and the DRC to that effect.The OSBP consultant’s scope of activities was supposed to

Contrary to the requirements of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that, although there were surplus funds amounting to UGX.9,526,145,971 for the Muyembe - Nakapiripirit Road project, management reallocated the funds to another Project to pay its debts without the Ministers approval.I noted delays in project implementation with cumulative physical progress as at 30th June 2021 at only 2.71% against 15.59% planned, resulting in an overall slippage of 12.88%.Contrary to the requirements of Clause 2.1 of the Contract Agreement between UNRA and the Contractor I noted that there were still some sections of the road that had pending land acquisition issues that needed to be addressed.I noted that acquisition of titles (i.e. legal ownership) for the acquired land (Muyembe-Nakapiripirit road having a total length of 92 Km) for which compensation had been made is still in process. However, it was not clear how far the process had reached and when it would end.  10.

 Contrary to the requirements of the Regulation 16 of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that UGX.4,526,512,477 (50%) of the available GoU counterpart funds for FY 2021/22 was reallocated to fund expenditures for Civil works of Kapchorwa-Suam road Project. This action overrides established budgeting procedures without the Minister’s approval.I reviewed the financing charges on the ADF loan and noted that total charges of UGX.3,357,809,609 were accrued on the disbursed and undisbursed loan balances with ADF during FY 2021/22. Furthermore, due to delayed procurement, prolonged acquisition of the Project right-of-way, and slow execution of works by the Contractors, the initial disbursement deadline of 31st December 2020 was extended to 31st December 2024. The implication is that the project is exposed to higher avoidable interest charges accruing from undisbursed loan balance due to loan under-utilization and hence delayed implementation of Project activities.The upgrade of the Rukungiri-Kihihi-Ishasha/Kanungu 78.5 km stretch attained 25.75% physical progress during the FY 2021/22. Cumulatively, since the Project’s inception, 68.35% physical progress had been attained, against the planned progress of 84.30% as of 30th June 2022. The slippage of 15.95% recorded was attributed to encumbrances on land on sections that required extra land take beyond the 30m standard Right of Way, excessive rainfall in the region, and the Contractors restricted access to Ishasha Bridge.Time elapsed as of 30th June 2022 was 43.8 months representing 88.3% of the total extended civil works contract duration of (49.6 months). Cumulative financial progress recorded was 55.23% against the planned 76.25%. There was a delay in conducting consultancy services procurement processes from initiation to contract signature; The procurement to conduct gender awareness took 1,513 days (equivalent to 4 years and 2 months)12. ofRoad Sector Support Project 5 (Upgrading Rukungiri-Kihihi- Ishasha/Kanungu Bumbobi- Lwakhakha Roads (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2022andUnqualifiedOpinion

These delays have attracted interest charges amounting to UGX.4,858,216,355. This is wasteful as it should have been avoided had the Supervising Consultant approved the IPCs in time.	
				
			 Audit noted that there were delays, by the Bank, ranging from 100 to 157 days to release funds requested by	
			UNRA for payment of contractor’s certificates to be remitted to the contractor’s bank account.

			that, although there were surplus funds amounting to UGX.3,687,491, 470 for Tirinyi Palisa Kumi Kamonkoli road	
			project that should have been returned to the consolidated fund at year end, management reallocated these funds

			 I noted that a total of UGX.4,563,236,836 for Lot 1 and UGX.1,075,035,660 for Lot 2 was paid to the contractor	
			as costs due to the approved Extension of Time amounting to 215 days and 45 days respectively beyond the

Competitiveness Enterprise Development (CEDP) COMPONENT 2-5 IDA CREDITS CR 52690-UG AND 65380-UG PROJECT ID P130471-2022and ProjectUnqualifiedOpinion			 The CEDP 2-5 project had budgeted for UGX.46.9Bn for the FY 2021/2022 to be spent on various outputs, however, only UGX.21.7Bn (46%) was utilised leading to under-absorption of UGX.25.2Bn (54%). Management attributed the poor absorption to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and disruptions in the supply chain that affected the implementation of planned activities and deliveries relating to procurements that had been undertaken.	
				
			 A total of USD.7,417,107 was spent by the project on various procurements for which there was no market price assessment. This was in contravention of Section 26 (4) of the PPDA Act. As a result, I was unable to confirm the basis on which the contract prices were determined.	
				
				
			 Project management awarded contracts to various suppliers for the supply of Motor Vehicles at a cost of	
			USD.1,322,779 (equivalent to UGX.4.765Bn). A total of UGX.552.8Mn was paid to the suppliers as 20% advance	
			payment while UGX.3.5Bn was used to secure letters of credit from Bank of Uganda in respect of the supplies.	
			Contrary to the delivery schedules stated in the bidding documents of between 90 days to 120 days, the bidder	
			quoted 3-6 months for the delivery of vehicles. After signing the contract, the delivery schedule was revised to 6-	
			7 months due to disruptions in the supply chain caused by COVID-19. The vehicles had not been delivered by the	
			time of reporting in December 2022. Failure to emphasise the delivery schedule could have disadvantaged other	
			potential suppliers, who could have delivered earlier.	
			 CEDP set out to procure a Boat for the Uganda Wildlife Education Centre at a contract price of USD.695,000	
			(equivalent to UGX.2.5Bn). As at the end of the year, the contract for the supply had expired, the final design had	
			not yet been agreed on and no delivery had been made. The contract had consequently not been performed,	
			leading to delayed service delivery.	
			 The Project effected payments amounting to USD.998,634 (equivalent to UGX.3.55Bn) in respect of the supply,	
			installation and maintenance of the Uganda Wildlife Authority Integrated Financial Management System for which	
			it was observed the contract implementation was marred by irregularities. Several modules purchased including	
			payroll batch processing, recruitment, leave management, and time management were not fully functional and	
			some were never utilized by the Authority. Lapses were noted in technical support management and failure by the	
			system to integrate with the banks. It was also noted that consequently, the Authority abandoned the system and	
			purchased another system to perform the same functionalities. No value for money was achieved in the	
			procurement.	
 MSC did not have a strategic plan aligned to NDPIII contrary to Section 13(6) of the PFMA, which requires that the annual budget shall be consistent with the National Development Plan, the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility4. Microfinance Support Centre Limited 2020/21Opinion

Unqualified (CFR) and the Budget Framework Paper (BFP). In addition, the strategic objectives outlined in the strategic plan were not specific and measurable, limiting performance assessment.

- It was observed that During the financial year 2020/21, out of the approved budget of UGX.401.643bn, UGX.402.617bn was realized, and UGX.370.683bn was spent. Out of the budget realized, MSC failed to absorb funds to a tune of UGX.31.934bn representing 7.93% of the realized funds limiting the service delivery.

- An audit of expenditure revealed that MSC effected reallocations/ virements on the budget line items worth UGX.1,015,000,000 from the departments of Finance, Administration and Human Resources, affecting the implementation of the planned outputs.

- A review of the loan portfolio of the company revealed that a total of UGX.126.37 billion relating to conventional lending was outstanding in loans and advances as at 30th June 2021. The portfolio had grown from UGX.75.14 Bn in 2019 by UGX.57 billion over the three years to UGX.126.37 Billion, locking funds to other befitting clients.

- During FY 2020/21, the MSCL Board approved the write-off of 167 loans amounting to UGX.4,682,672,669 without following the Public Finance Management Act 2015, which requires approval by the Parliament on write off above 10 million. The total loans written-off (incl. Principal, interest and charges/penalties) over the same period amounted to UGX.27,515,715,35. I noted that FYs 2020/21 (20.7%), 2014/15(37.9%) and 2012/13 (19.1%) accounted for the highest proportion of loan write-offs attributed when compared to the total loan amount disbursed over since 2005. The write-offs lock funds to befitting potential clients.

- Under absorption of emyooga funds. Out of the receipts of UGX.337.72Bn, a total of UGX.304.3 Bn (90%) was spent and/or disbursed by the entity, leaving a balance of UGX.33.3bn (24%) limiting the service delivery.

- Over 6,326 EMYOOGA SACCOs validated and financed through Microfinance Support Centre by June 2021 were in operation without acquiring a license to operate from the Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority.

- Microfinance Support Centre Limited disbursed funds worth UGX.7.750Bn to 252 unregistered SACCOs as of 31st March 2021, exposing public resources to the risk of loss.

- Out of the funds that were disbursed as grants to various constituencies SACCOS, UGX. 34,716,666,049 remained un-accessed by the beneficiary SACCOS as at 30th June 2021, rendering the transferred fund idle.

- Physical inspections in Kayunga District revealed that a total of UGX.500,000,000 disbursed by various SACCOs was never supported by loan agreements. There was no evidence to support the existence of the borrowing by associations, and beneficiaries could not be traced hence misappropriation.

- It was observed that from a sample of the SACCOs that were inspected, a total of 140 associations that had accessed loans worth UGX.3.52bn, from the Apex Constituency SACCOs, had defaulted in payment of UGX.2.49bn by the time of verification, representing 70.74% default rate.

- A review of the SACCOs’ documentation regarding disbursements of loans to the different beneficiaries revealed the absence of loans agreements with some borrowers exposing the funds to the risk of default.

5. Enterprise Uganda FoundationUnqualifiedOpinion			 The Foundation does not have a comprehensive database for all MSMEs in Uganda contrary to Clause 3.3(A) of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to promote the development of Medium Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) in Uganda. There is a risk that some MSMEs missed out the opportunities provided by the Foundation.	
				
			 One of the objectives of the Foundation is to create and nurture special interest groups like Women and Youth to	
			become effective entrepreneurs and enhance the productivity, growth and competitiveness of MSMEs in Uganda.	
			However, the criterion utilized in selection of these beneficiaries was not in place. There is a likelihood of deserving

Whereas UGX. 1,500,000,000 had been appropriated, UGX. 3,344,571,000 was spent.I established that the Unit did not have any quantified outputs, and as such, no assessment as to the extent of implementation was undertaken. I was therefore unable to establish the reasonableness of individual activity costs for each planned outputI noted that the Government had entered into concessions with various Government and private organizations for the provisions of different services, but the Accounting Officer had failed to recognize the same in the statement of financial. The organizations include; Dairy Corporation Ltd, Kilembe Mines Limited, Nile Hotel International Limited, Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited, Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited, Uganda Railways Corporation, Uganda seeds Limited (Nyakatonzi cooperative Union), Uganda Seeds Limited (Farm Input Care Centre Limited [FICA}), Uganda Livestock Industries Limited (Kiryana Ranch), Uganda Livestock Industries Limited (Kyempisi Ranch) and Uganda Livestock Industries Limited (Aswa Ranch-Partial Sale of 297 Hectares). During the year under review, I observed that PU had down sized affecting several operations of the Unit that include among others, non-renewal of contracts for most staff (current staff are only 3), reduction of staff salaries6.

due to non-availability of budget to fund the unit operations and non-renewal of the rent agreement for the units office premises among others.I noted that Privatization Unit had continued to irregularly accumulate domestic arrears. The value of arrears grew up to UGX.10,377,057,000 from UGX.10,278,272,000 of the previous year. A review of the composition of the payables revealed that UGX.9,984,335,000 (96% of the total payables) relates to Pay as You Earn (PAYE).I also established that currently, the Unit has a DRIC committee that is fully constituted in accordance with the applicable laws. It was, however noted the appointments of the members to the committee were never time- bound, and as such, some members had served for over 10 years.

			project completion activities and operating costs.	
			 I observed that there was no exit strategy in place. During the last implementation support mission, PROFIRA	
			Management agreed to work closely with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED)	
			and the Parish Development Model (PDM) Secretariat to develop a clear proposal for MoFPED to consider scaling

			Furthermore, PROFIRA was to develop a proposal for the deployment of revolving funds to Community Savings	
			and Credit Groups (CSCGs)/Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) and other SACCOs already in existence	
			for consideration under PDM.	
			 I observed that the GoU and IFAD agreed to offer additional contracts to two contracted Service Providers till	
			November 2022, to ensure that grant funds are fully and properly utilized, and that outcome measurement of the	
			grant is facilitated. During audit examination, I however noted that the contracts have not been signed and

I noted that, as reported in my report for the year ended 30th June 2020, Government of Uganda has not yet honored its obligation of UGX.5.6Bn as co-funding for the Project. The project entirely depended on the IFAD funding in implementing its activitiesI observed that the project has been supporting SACCO’s that were not registered by Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA).

Un utilised warrants signify failure to utilise availed funds which negatively impacts service delivery.Out of the domestic arrears balance of UGX.442Mn at the beginning of the year, only UGX.122Mn (28%) was paid, while the balance of UGX.319Mn still remained outstanding during the Financial Year 2021/2022.

 The Directorate of Ethics and Integrity (DEI) has an approved staff structure of 122, but only 54 (44.3%) were filled leaving 68 (55.7%) positions unfilled. Failure to fill the staff establishment hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Directorate.Management spent a total of UGX.248.883Mn on micro procurements without use of request for quotations, contrary to the PPDA Act Section 79 (1) Subsection 5(C) and 7(C) Fourth Schedule, that specifies the conditions for use of Procurement Methods for Micro Procurement and Quotation and proposal method. This could lead to uncompetitive prices and failure to maximize value for money.The Directorate irregularly used direct procurement for the purchase of vehicles at a cost of UGX.1.046Bn, contrary to PPDA Guidelines 2014 Paragraph 1, Thresholds for Procurement of supplies and non-consultancy services, method. This could also lead to uncompetitive prices and failure to maximize value for money.A review of the governance structures indicated that there was neither specific structure that steers and oversees ICT implementation nor an approved IT staff structure while at the same time the expected ICT Unit of two staff, only one position had been filled.

I further noted that of the total warrants of UGX.8.310Bn, the Board spent a total of UGX.7.528Bn resulting into unspent warrants of UGX.0.782Bn. Unreleased and unutilised funds signify failure to implement all the planned activities which negatively impacts service delivery.The Board remained understaffed with only had 36 positions out of 51 approved positions leaving a gap of 15 positions, representing 30% of the approved structure. Understaffing constrains effective service delivery.The Board failed to prepare 4 Statutory Regulations to regulate the industry contrary to the provision of Section 70 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015.I noted that the entity failed to prepare a National Register of gaming or betting machines and devices, as provided for under Section 36 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015. Absence of a register of machines and equipment being used in the industry, complicates monitoring and renewal of licences and also exposes the industry players to risks of using inappropriate machinery and equipment. I carried out a review of management of IT investments at the entity and noted that;o 138 IT assets (100%) inspected over the period under review were not accurately recorded in the Assets register.14.

As a result, some planned activities could not be implemented.There is an apparent conflict between Section 28 of the Tier-4-Microfinance-Institutions-Money-Lenders Act, 2016 and Section 51 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 with regard to the period for submission of financial Statements to the Auditor General. The former prescribes three months while the later provides 2 months after the end of the financial year.I noted the following matters in the management of the licensing mandate of the Authority over SACCOs and Money lenders;Challenges in licensing of SACCOs arising out of a conflict of laws between the Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions and Money lenders Act and the Cooperative Societies Act 2020 resulting in low registrations.Failure by the Minister to put in place the maximum interest chargeable by the different money lenders contrary to the requirements of the Act.Absence of clear guidelines for the determination of ‘fit and proper persons’ for purposes of money lenders.28.

29. Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED)UnqualifiedOpinion			 I noted that the MoFPED had an approved budget of UGX.815.5Bn out of which UGX.792.8Bn was warranted,	
				
			resulting in a shortfall of UGX.22.7Bn, which represents 2.8% of the approved budget. Budget shortfalls constrain management is implementing fully, the approved activities and hence service delivery.	
				
			 Out of the total warrants of UGX.792.8Bn received during the financial year, UGX.782.4Bn was utilised by the	
			Ministry resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.10.34Bn representing absorption level of 98.7%. As a result, I	
			noted that of the 64 outputs that I sampled, Eighteen (18) outputs were fully implemented, thirty-six (36) outputs	
			were partially implemented, Seven (7) out puts were not implemented, while Three (3) out puts could not be	
			assessed. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.	
			 The Ministry did not have a running strategic plan to facilitate achievement of the NDP III objectives. This poses	
			a risk of non-attainment of NDP III objectives since the strategic plan that would serve as basis for the annual	
			plan and budget that is being implemented is non-existent.	
			 Domestic arrears stock was reported as UGX.473Bn as at the end of the financial year 2021/22 up from	
			UGX.268.9Bn in F/Y 2020/21 representing 76% increase. The Domestic arrears are not given appropriate budget	
			provision hence accumulation of the stock. Failure to budget and pay arrears negatively impacts the	
			creditworthiness of the Ministry and could result into penalties and costly litigations.	
			 The Ministry did not disclose contingent liabilities worth UGX2.839Bn in the memorandum statement of Contingent	
			liabilities. This denies end users of the Financial Statements useful information for decision making.	
			 The Ministry has seven (7) IT systems which were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with	
			other systems. This could lead to duplication of functionalities, procurement of non-compatible solutions and	
			equipment, and general deviation from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service delivery.	
 The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2020/21) was UGX.45.49Trillion, which would have translated into UGX.227.47Bn funding for the Contingencies Fund in the year under review, in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015.

o Parliament appropriated UGX.62.07Bn out of UGX.227.47Bn (27.3%) to the Contingencies Fund, leading to a deficit of UGX.165.40Bn (72.7%). o Due to an upsurge of COVID-19, additional funds were appropriated via a supplementary budget of UGX.228.30Bn, making a total of UGX.290.37Bn. o Out of the total warrants of UGX.290.37Bn, only UGX.72.06Bn (24.8%) was released to the MDAs for emergencies, leading to a total deficit of UGX.219.33Bn (75.5%).The continued failure to appropriate funds in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015 (as amended), is an indicator of noncompliance and defeats the intentions of the law.				
31. Treasury OperationsUnqualifiedOpinion			 The Treasury Operations had an initial approved budget of UGX.15.094Tn which was later revised to	
			UGX.17.863Tn. Out of the revised Budget, UGX.17.391Tn was warranted, out of which, UGX.13.959Tn was utilized by the entity resulting into an unutilized balance of UGX.3.432Tn representing a performance level of 80.26%. Audit however noted that the entity remained with a total of UGX.4.661Tn as payables at year end.	
				
			 There are was a significant change of the reported payables from UGX.2.345Tn to UGX.4.583Tn resulting into	
			an increase of UGX.2.238Tn representing 95%. The significant increment in the liabilities was due to the	
			International Court of Justice ruling in favour of Democratic Republic of Congo to a tune of UGX.1.228Tn and the	
			assumption of Uganda Telcom liabilities of UGX.0.028Tn.	
			 Audit noted that as regards the management of Boards for Corporations and companies in which Government has	
			shareholding, there were no clear guidelines, policies or regulations for the management, appointment, evaluation	
			or determination of such Boards.	
			 The government is defaulting on the payment of an outstanding balance of USD.889,411.24 (UGX.3,343Bn)	
			out of a total USD.1,659,450.22 as a 10 th Instalment for 51 callable shares from African Development Bank	
			(ADB). Failure to pay-up on callable shares puts the country at a risk of losing paid up shares and the corresponding	
			callable shares in the Bank.	
Out of the approved budget of UGX.154.18Bn for capital expenditure, Emyooga grant and other recurrent expenditures, UGX.146.85Bn was realized and UGX.125.65Bn was spent, leaving UGX.21.2Bn unspent which represents 14.4% of the realized funds. Unspent funds represent services not delivered.A total of UGX.1.44Bn was disbursed as additional capitalization to the existing EMYOGA SACCOs when they had not made recoveries of above 70% of the first seed capital disbursed, as evidenced by the loan disbursement and recovery schedules submitted by the respective SACCOs. This can lead to disbursements to SACCOs that are already at default.The loan portfolio of the company has grown from UGX.105Bn in 2020 to UGX.146Bn over the three years representing a 39% growth. However, a total of UGX.3.7Bn was disbursed to several clients without undertaking adequate loan appraisal documentation, hence an increase in default risk exposure as well as potential loss to government. 32.

Such increases imply that there are more loans that are likely to become uncollectable and therefore leading to loss to government. I noted weaknesses in the IT systems which include;o There was no evidence of systems ownership o The two systems operated by the entity were not integrated or not automatically sharing informationo There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation. o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy and risk register at the entity. o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policywith other systems.2014.

			(23.7%) positions not yet filled. Staffing gaps constrain the entity in implementing its mandate effectively.	
			 NPC staff were paid a salaries amounting to UGX.4.01Bn for the F/Y 2021/2022 off the IPPS and yet the human	
			resource system was procured for payroll management. This creates an opportunity for payment of ineligible staff	
			and creation of non-existent staff/pensioners.	
			 I carried out a review of management of IT investments at the entity and noted that;	
			 Three (3) IT systems /equipment acquired at UGX.415Mn had no clearance from NITA-U, while IT	
			systems/equipment costing UGX.342Mn did not have clearance from MoFPED.	
			 Two (2) Multi-year system implementation projects worth total of UGX.342Mn did not have approval from	
			Parliament.	
			 The National population data bank and the KMIS systems costing UGX.342Mn were not being utilized by NPC.	
			 Absence of ICT governance structures hampers formulation of appropriate ICT policies, strategies and may lead	
			to misalignment of IT investments with the overall strategic objectives.	
PPDA had an approved budget of UGX.23.28Bn out of which UGX.19.52Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.76Bn which represents 16.15% of the approved budget. The deficit in the budget negatively impacted service delivery.34. Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA)UnqualifiedOpinion

 According to the staff establishment, the approved number of positions for PPDA is 140, out of which only 103 positions were filled, leaving 37 positions vacant, which is 26% of the workforce. Failure to fill the staff establishment hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Authority.				
35. Uganda Property Holdings Limited (UPHL)UnqualifiedOpinion			The entity budgeted to collect UGX.11.16Bn revenue and collected UGX.10.88Bn resulting into an underperformance of UGX.0.28, which was 2.6% of the budget. The underperformance in NTR collections was partly attributed to the depreciating value of the Uganda shilling against the Kenyan shilling and the Great Britain Pound.	
				
			 I noted that the entity had receivables from UGX.4.7Bn in the statement of financial position at year-end implying	
			that these were not honoured within the 15 working days as required by regulations thereby holding up funds	
			which would have been used to implement planned activities.	
			 A review of the properties owned by the Government of Uganda within and outside the country revealed that	
			several commercial properties are not owned and managed by UPHL, yet the company was established majorly to	
			hold, invest in and control the real estate properties of the Government of Uganda. The properties risk being	
			condemned because of poor management.	
			 The company procured IT systems which were not integrated thereby not meeting the intended objective of shared	
			information.	
I noted that Uganda Property Holdings Limited did not manage some Government Commercial properties. This company was established principally to own, invest in and control the real estate Properties of the Government of Uganda. As a result, some commercial buildings in Nairobi, Kinshasa, and London are not well maintained to the extent of being at risk of condemnation by the relevant city authorities, like the Commercial Building in Nairobi. Management explained that the cabinet is handling the issue, and I am waiting for the cabinet's decision.Uganda Property Holding has 39 properties comprising of 23 in Mombasa, 12 in Uganda, and 4 in the UK. I reviewed all ownership documents for the said properties and found that two properties did not have certificates of title, namely, Plot M82, Masese, Jinja, and Plot KRC Mbaraki, Mombasa. I advised management to follow up on the above properties and secure their ownership by obtaining the certificate of titles.36.

37. Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS).UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.67.52Bn, the Bureau utilized warrants amounting to UGX.60.12Bn resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.7.4Bn representing an absorption level of 89.2%. As a result, I noted that of the 124 quantified activities worth UGX.23.6Bn assessed, 90 activities representing 72.6% were fully implemented, 22 activities representing 21.8% were partially implemented, while 7 activities representing 5.6% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.	
				
			 A review of the staffing structure for UBOS revealed that out of the total approved staff establishment of 413	
			staff, only 285 (69%) positions were filled, leaving 128 (31%) positions vacant. Understaffing negatively impacts	
			on the Bureau’s capacity to deliver services.

				 I noted that the buildings located at UBOS Entebbe Office were in a poor state, and are were due for demolition.	
				Although UBOS has an architectural plan for redevelopment of the UBOS office into the East African Bureau of	
				Statistics and a training centre, funding for the construction works has not yet been secured.	
				 I noted that Parish Development Model (PDM) baseline data collection exercise had only commenced in 169 out	
				of 181 Higher Local Governments (HLGs) and the exercise was incomplete and behind schedule at a completion	
				rate of 41%. The data processing at the Bureau had also been affected by limited access granted by the Ministry	
				of ICT and National Guidance (MOICT&NG) to the data collected from the local governments which is affecting the	
				initial implementation of Parish Development Model.	
				 I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.1.08Bn were not executed as of 30th June 2022. As a result,	
				implementation of critical government programs was delayed.	
				 I noted inadequate management of grants from development partners relating to three projects under the Bureau;	
					
				o I observed that the Bureau received UGX.5.15Bn from the Ministry of Education and Sports for the Baseline	
				Education Census Project funded by World Bank. However, I noted that the exercise was delayed and only	
				UGX.1.2Bn had been utilized by the time of audit (November 2022) for the recruitment, procurement of	
				tools for the census, and training of project staff.	
					
				o During the FY 2021/2022, the Bureau received UGX.2.14Bn for the project: Support of the Advancement	
				of the Uganda Annual Agricultural Survey (AAS). However, the Bureau failed to absorb part of the funds	
				and refunded UGX.1.87Bn to the FAO International Representative.	
					
				 Failure to absorb project funds leads to delayed service delivery.	
					
38.	The Authority had a revenue collection target of UGX.22,802.62Bn, out of which UGX.22,098.06Bn (96.9%) was collected. Under-collection of revenue affects the overall delivery of Public services by the Government.Out of the planned 493 compliance audits, only 227 (46%) were carried out, implying that the corrective actions that would have been undertaken to enhance tax compliance were impeded. This negatively affected revenue collection.Despite several tax heads having 0 (zero) budgeted revenue, a total of UGX.370.58Bn was collected from the tax heads in question - contrary to the provisions in Paragraph 4.19.3 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 and Section 45(3) of the PFMA, 2015.URA did not have documented step-wise processes on the importation and exportation of precious minerals.

The entity budgeted to receive UGX.14Bn during the year, but only received UGX.12.72Bn which resulted into a shortfall of UGX.1.28Bn which represents 9.1% of the approved budget. As a result, some planned activities such as; Board capacity development, Trustee certification programme and Sector players’ workshops were not implemented. This impacts negatively, on service delivery.40. Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority.UnqualifiedOpinion

The approved structure for URBRA provides a staff ceiling of 73, however, I observed that only 42 positions (57.5%) were filled, hence a staffing gap of 31 positions (42.5%) which includes key positions such as one Director and eight (8) manager positions. This limits the Authority’s capacity to duly implement all its mandate.A review of the Authority’s procurement plan, procurement files and the annual procurement report/register, indicated that procurements worth UGX.0.114Bn were not implemented. This in turn leads to delayed delivery of services.				
41. Financial Intelligence Authority.Opinion Unqualified			 I noted that the entity did not budget to collect NTR during the year but collected UGX.13Mn. Failure to budget for revenue leads to unauthorized collections and makes it impossible to measure performance.	
				
				
			 Review of the entity’s staffing structures revealed that out of the total approved structure of 86 staff, only 41 (48.8%) positions were filled and 45 (51.2%) positions had not yet been filled. These included the key posts of; Director Legal, Inspection and Compliance, Director Audit, Director Finance and Administration among others. Understaffing contrains the entity’s capacity to effectively deliver its mandate.	
				
				
				
			 The Authority made procurements for a total of UGX0.551Mn without conducting market assessments. Lack of	
			market surveys is not only irregular, but also implies procurements could have been executed at uncompetitive	
			prices, hence impacting on value for money.	
ITC had an approved budget of UGX.9.177Bn of which UGX.8.325Bn was realized, leading to a shortfall of UGX.0.852Bn representing 9.9%% of the budget. I further noted that out of the total receipts for the year, only UGX.6.332Bn was expensed, leading to a surplus of UGX.1.992Bn representing 69% absorption. Also noted was that out of the eleven (11) planned activities, the entity fully implemented five (5) activities, while four (4) activities were partially implemented, and two (2) activities remained unimplemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.ITC acquired fourteen (14) IT assets worth UGX.326.9Mn without clearance from NITA-U. Such non-compliance with the government policies and guidelines may lead to duplication of acquisition, non-compatible solutions which can lead to loss to government.42.

The deficit represents 3.2% of the approved budget. The deficit in the budget negatively impacted service delivery.The entity had an ambitious plan of one hundred fifty thousand and nine hundred twenty (150,920) planned activities worth UGX.2.8Bn, out of which, only seven hundred and eighteen (1,718) activities were fully	
				
			implemented, hence limiting delivery of the entity’s mandate and service delivery.	
			 A total of 163 tax appeal cases worth UGX.882.6Bn were pending, resulting into locking potential government

			 Out of the 40 approved posts, only 23 were filled leaving a balance of 17 vacant, which represents 43% of the

A total of UGX.17.786Bn was received to be spent on different outputs during the year under review, and only UGX.9.155Bn (51%) was utilized leading to under-absorption of UGX.8.634Bn (49%). As a result, several planned activities were not implemented.A review of the contract for the production of base maps for land administration in Uganda awarded to a firm at a contract price of Euros 4,712,135 revealed a contract performance of 89% despite having paid Euros 4,294,439 (91.1%) of the contract price.44.

The Authority collected revenue UGX.20.02Bn out of a budget of UGX.21.55Bn. This was in addition to balance brought forward of UGX.7.69Bn resulting in total funds available amounting to UGX.27.71Bn. I reviewed the Authority’s budget implementation and noted that out of the 67 quantified activities assessed worth UGX.2.314Bn; 36 activities representing 54% were fully implemented, 18 activities representing 27% were partially implemented, while 13 activities representing 19% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities delays service delivery.IRA has a staffing structure totaling to one hundred and nine (109) staff of which eighty-six (86) staff positions (i.e. 78% of the approved structure) filled, leaving a balance of twenty-three (23) positions (22%) vacant.

   Out of the approved budget of UGX.6.894Bn, UGX.6.237Bn was warranted and the entity spent UGX.5.246Bn resulting into un-utilized warrants of UGX.975Bn representing an absorption level of 84.32%. As a result, some of the Authority planned activities remained unimplemented, due to failure to absorb all the availed funding, which in turn, negatively impacts service delivery.The entity paid mandatory (10%) contributions to the National Social Security Fund worth UGX.301.66Mn, and also paid an extra UGX.446.04Mn to a second standard contribution scheme operated by the Authority. This resulted into a double payment of gratuity contributions contrary to the requirements of the Public Service Standing Orders.The responsible Minister had not constituted the Capital Markets Tribunal to handle disputes arising out of disputes in the sector. The entity also lacked some critical regulations necessary for the management of the activities of the Authority.The audit of the licensing function revealed that: The Authority conducted irregular licensing without prescribed fees being paid, the entity failed to follow up licensees with expired licenses, the entity failed to collect security deposit from Brokers dealers licensed, lacked evidence of proper due diligence, and also failed to license primary dealers of Government Bonds. Such weaknesses point to challenges in execution of its mandate which could lead to failure to collect all potential revenues.In the audit of Human Resource management, I noted that the Authority lacked an approved staff and salary structure, contrary to the standing orders. There were also no comprehensive annual performance plans and Job Descriptions for the staff during the year under review. This complicates assessment of staff performance at year end.48.

			 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.74.5Bn, only UGX.72Bn was spent by the entity resulting in	
			an unspent balance of UGX.2.5Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. As a result, some planned activities	
			were not implemented.	
			 The entity has outstanding payables of UGX.320.471Bn in the statement of financial position of which	
			UGX.320.033Bn is an unpaid pension for former UPTC and UTL staff. Unpaid pension not only exposes government	
			to risks of costly litigation but also denies the pensioners their right to live a decent life.	
			 The Ministry-approved establishment has 103 positions of which 63 positions are filled (61.2%) leaving a staffing	
			gap of 40 positions (38.8%). Understaffing negatively affects the overall service delivery.	
			 I reviewed ICT investment initiatives and noted;	
			o There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.	
			o The entity has 7 (53.8%) out of 13 positions of ICT staff establishment. All have the required	
			qualifications.	
			o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.	
			o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy

			 One system, the Academic Information Management System (AIMS), costing UGX.3.0Bn was developed using	
			Innovators and adopted by Government, however, the source codes were yet to be handed over to evidence	
			Government Ownership.	
			 The Ministry budgeted for UGX.12.4Bn for PDM activities, out of which, UGX.9.4Bn was released resulting in a	
			budget shortfall of UGX.3Bn (25%). As a result, planned PDM activities were not fully implemented.	
  I noted that the Actuary/ Asset Consultant did not conduct an actuarial valuation of the scheme for the year under review, and the existing one was done in 2019.There were unsupported payables of UGX.3.904 Bn, of which Administrative fees of UGX.2.022Bn and Actuarial fees of UGX.442Mn. Under the circumstances, it was difficult to provide assurance that the amounts in question are genuine liabilities to the Scheme. I further noted that the amounts have not changed over the years implying Scheme’s inability to settle its obligations.Disclosed under Note 15 to the Financial Statements on page 22, are receivables recognised by the Scheme amounting to UGX.4.171Bn, up from UGX.4.038Bn the previous year, arising from amounts due from employers (UTL In-Administration). However, these receivables were not supported with any documentation and schedule to confirm the amounts and authenticity, which renders the receivables doubtful.I further noted that as reported in the previous year, according to UTL in-administration, only UGX.2.466Bn was due to UCECPS, implying a variance of UGX.1.705Bn.51.

    During the FY 2020/21, UCECPS realised only UGX.0.311Bn but expended UGX.0.332Bn, representing 106.74% of the realised monies. I noted that the expenditure exceeded the cash collection, and payments were made using the cash balances carried forward from FY 2019/2020.I established from the statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits on page 14 of the financial statements that the current assets amounting to UGX.4,550,343,000 was due from government. This arose after management on the advice of government, diverted money from the Defined Contributions (DC) active members Fund to pay the increased monthly pensions to the Defined Benefits members, thus creating a deficit/Liability to the scheme.PS/ST directed that UCECPS transfer the files of all pensioners of UPTC to the line Ministry of Information Communication Technology and National Guidance (MoICT&NG) to facilitate the payment of the pensioners effective FY 2020/2021 in accordance with the decentralisation policy. I noted however that, the decision to streamline pension payments has created uncertainty on the continuity of UCECPSs.During the year under review, the scheme expected a total sum of UGX.331,340,796 from the Employer (UTL) as a contribution to the members. However, only UGX.310,962,857 was remitted relating to arrears which in turn led to the monthly interest which accumulated to UGX.112,119,561. The total amounts due from the employers (UTL) had accumulated to UGX.4,171,050,819 as of 30th June 2021.PAYE of UGX.44,867,514 withheld from employees as required during the year was never remitted to URA by the year end. I further noted that the accumulated PAYE arrears stood at UGX.241,677,000.I noted that the board was not fully constituted as the Government (Founder) had only appointed one representative as of 30th June 2021				
52. Uganda Institute of Communication Technology (UICT).UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the approved budget for the financial year of UGX.11.4Bn, only UGX.6.1Bn was collected by the entity resulting into an under-collection of UGX.5.3Bn representing a performance level of 53.5%. As a result, I noted that of the 15 quantified activities worth UGX.3.95Bn assessed; no activities were fully implemented, while 15 activities representing 100% were partially implemented. Failure to fully implement planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.	
				
			 I noted that the staff establishment showed that only thirty-seven (37) positions (38%) were filled out of the	
			established ninety-seven (97) positions leaving sixty (60) positions vacant (62%). Most of the vacant positions	
			were key positions that are required to achieve the mandate of the Institute. Failure to fill the staff establishment	
			hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Institute.	
			 The Institute was among the 11 entities selected for implementation of Electronic Government Procurement (EGP)	
			system, and hence was required to conduct all its procurement process on the EGP system effective 1/July/2021.	
			However, I noted that the Institute faced a number operational challenges that affected the timely implementation	
			of planned procurements. These included;	
			• The system was unable to update the procurement file directory where; procurement is retendered,	
			where a requisition is rejected before final approval, where procurement is reinstated due to inadequate	
			statement of requirements and where procurement is cancelled.

			• The system network connectivity was noted to be unstable and this delayed implementation of various	
			procurements, which greatly affected service delivery at the Institute.	
			 I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.1.06Bn were not initiated as of 30th June 2022. As a result,	
			implementation of critical institute programs was delayed.	
The entity budgeted to receive UGX. 3.5 Bn, out of which UGX.2.38 Bn was availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.1.11 Bn, which is 31.7% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities.The Institute has total receivables of UGX.440,038,625 in the statement of financial position, which includes an amount of UGX.343,855,528 relating to student debtors. The student-related receivables grew by 11% from UGX.308,954,465 (2019/20) to UGX.343,855,528 (2020/2021).The institute and staff who were in acting position for more than 6 months, contrary to Section 3.3.5.1 of the UICT Human Resource Manual 2018 that requires that acting appointments not to exceed six (6) months, save for special circumstances approved by the Governing Council. In addition, a review of the staff establishment showed 107 (61%) positions were filled, 68 (38.9%) positions vacant.

Accumulation of receivables denies the company the cash flows which are vital for service delivery.	
				
			 The financial statements revealed that UPL’s payables increased by UGX.1.9Bn from UGX.14.79Bn as at 30th June	
			2021 to UGX.16.69Bn in financial year 30th June 2022. Accumulation of payables creates a risk of litigation that	
			may lead to payment of penalties and fines for delayed settlement to possible aggrieved parties in future.	
			 A review of UPL’s staff list as at 30th June 2022 and the approved Organisation Structure revealed that out of the	
			staff establishment of 247, only 172 positions were filled, leading to a staffing gap of 75 (30.4%). Inadequacy in	
			staffing leads to inability to fully carry out the mandate hence negatively negatively impacting on staff performance,	
			service delivery and attainmant of company objectives.	
			 The following aspects were noted in regard to management land by UPL;	
			 The Company did not renew leases for three (3) pieces of land. The entity has taken an average of 14 years from	
			the time of expiry of the lease term without having them renewed. This exposes such land to a risk of loss.	
			 I noted that 10 pieces of land did not have their sizes recorded in the land register either in acres or hectares as	
			required. I also noted that 8 pieces of land did not have a value attached to them in form of cost of valuation	
			amount.	
			 I noted that 1 piece of land measuring approximately 0.464 hectares (5.8%) valued at UGX.1.147Bn was not being	
			utilized by the entity.

			 I noted that 1 piece of land measuring 0.612 hectares (7.5 %) valued at UGX 0.465Bn out of the 8.06798 hectares	
			of land owned by the entity had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions.

Un utilised funds imply that some planned activities may not have been implemented, leading to delayed service delivery.The Commission irregularly paid UGX.228Mn for extra civil works on the installation of Lifts at Communications House. The additional works were not part of the original contract and were not approved by the Commission’s Contract Committee, contrary to the procurement regulations.The Commission did not charge 2% Gross Annual Revenue for Registered Television Stations and FM Radio stations as required by the UCC New License framework on fees and fines under General Notice No. 977 of 2017. This deprives the Commission of revenue.The Commission does not have procedures on management of confiscated equipment. This may lead to misuse of the confiscated equipment and may deepen disputes and cause financial losses to Government.The Commission has delayed completion of the National E-commerce Platform aimed at supporting SMEs in the informal sectors of the Agriculture, Retail and Services industry in Uganda, in order to promote access to online sales, overcome challenges in delivering to too hard-to-reach communities and to spur economic growth. As a result, the informal sector is losing out on the benefits of E-commerce.Eight (8) IT systems/equipment procured at UGX.9.8Bn were not cleared by NITA-U contrary to current guidelines. Besides, six (6) IT systems developed in-house were not being optimally utilized by the entity, while three (3) systems were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with other systems.

Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.58.41Bn, only UGX.53.75Bn was spent by the entity resulting into unutilized funds of UGX.4.655Bn representing an absorption level of 92.02%. I noted that of the 19 outputs that I sampled, 12 outputs with 14 activities were fully implemented, 15 quantified activities of the 5 outputs were not implemented. 2 outputs could not be assessed due to lack of performance targets and indicators. Failure to fully implement all planned outputs negatively impacts service delivery.The Project remained with outstanding payables totalling to UGX.5.08Bn by the end of year, which were as a result of completion works for the last mile project whose payments were not made to the contractors. World Bank/IDA cautioned and notified NITAU and MoFPED that it would not pay or take on any project liabilities after 31st December 2022. This implies that Government may have to bear the burden of paying the respective suppliers.A total of USD.249,500 was spent without obtaining a no objection from the World Bank in accordance with the funding guidelines. This caused the PS/ST to instruct the Accounting Officer of NITAU to refund the money to abate the risk of affecting funding of other ongoing World Bank Projects.The Project failed to upgrade the service desk due to the limited time to procure and implement the works before project closure in December 2022. Consequently, a total of USD.664,160.64 was reallocated from the IT service desk budget to upgrade the Data centre.57.

NationalAuthority – Uganda (NITA-U)Information TechnologyUnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.30.24Bn, only UGX.28.678Bn was spent by the entity resulting in unutilized funds of UGX.1.559Bn representing an absorption level of 94.84%. As a result, I noted that some of the planned activities for the year were not implemented, which negatively impacts on service delivery.	
				
			 The Authority accumulated receivables and payables to a tune of UGX.28.5Bn and UGX.21.85Bn respectively. The	
			accumulation of receivables was a result of non-consolidation of MDA and LG IT budgets with NITA-U while the	
			payables was a result of the budget cuts on the IT consolidated Budget of MDAs and LGs.	
			 The Authority did not have a fully constituted Board which may lead to NITA failing to have effective oversight	
			functions appropriately undertaken.	
			 I noted a delay in reduction of the cost of internet to USD.20 per MBPS in order to promote connectivity in provision	
			of Government services in the country. Failure to reduce the internet cost will deny service delivery such as	
			affordable communication and electronic learning in both public and private institutions country wide.	
			 The Authority was registering professionals and the training institutions without a prescribed standards or	
			regulations. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since	
			2017, 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while

    The Corporations Trade and other Payables increased to UGX.84Bn from UGX.75.119 (i.e. an increase of …%). Further analysis on trade and other payables revealed that some payables had remained outstanding for more than eight years old without any movements. The increased payables expose the Corporation to a risk of costly litigation as well as penalties and fines from statutory bodies.The Corporation has contingent liabilities outstanding as of 30th June 2022 of UGX.6.252Bn. This figure significantly increased by 300% from UGX.1.827Bn as at 30th June 2021. This figure will worsen the liability position if it materialises.The Corporations’ strategic plan running for the period 2017-2022 had expired and Management was in process of designing a new one aligned to NDPIII. It implies the organisastion is being managed without a strategic direction.The Corporation has an approved staff establishment for 353 positions of which 99 (28%) positions remained vacant due to indequate wage. This undermines service delivery.The Corporation does not have Land titles for 36 pieces of land it currently owns. Further, the Corporation owns 80 acres of land as per Vesting Order at Bobi-Gulu and the land is not being utilized and hosts equipment that is not on air. Lack of Land titles may result in encroachment, disputes and even loss of public land.The Corporation has land titles for 19 pieces of land which were leased out, however there were no lease agreements for 10 of these pieces of land. In addition, out of 19 pieces of land leased out, 6 pieces had expired leases. This exposes such land to a risk of loss. I reviewed Uganda Broad Casting Corporation IT systems and noted the following;o The systems were not intergrated,o no systems maintenance strategy and policy was in place,o SONAPS system used for studios production chain for ingesting media from various sources onto UBC computing storage, editing content, archiving and storage, playout, scheduling of adverts and announcements, and monitoring became unusable after 3 years in use.o The entity did not have an approved IT staff structure in place despite ICT prioritization in NDP III.o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014.59.

			 The financial statements revealed that UPL’s payables increased by UGX.1.9Bn from UGX.14.79Bn as at 30 th June 2021 to UGX.16.69Bn in financial year 30 th June 2022. Accumulation of payables creates a risk of litigation	
			that may lead to payment of penalties and fines for delayed settlement to possible aggrieved parties in future.	
			 A review of UPL’s staff list as at 30 th June 2022 and the approved Organisation Structure revealed that out of the	
			staff establishment of 247, only 172 positions were filled, leading to a staffing gap of 75 (30.4%). Inadequacy in	
			staffing leads to inability to fully carry out the mandate hence negatively negatively impacting on staff performance,	
			service delivery and attainmant of company objectives.	
			 The following aspects were noted in regard to management land by UPL;	
				
			o The Company did not renew leases for three (3) pieces of land. The entity has taken an average of 14	
			years from the time of expiry of the lease term without having them renewed. This exposes such land to a	
			risk of loss.	
			o I noted that 10 pieces of land did not have their sizes recorded in the land register either in acres or	
			hectares as required. I also noted that 8 pieces of land did not have a value attached to them in form of	
			cost of valuation amount.	
			o I noted that 1 piece of land measuring approximately 0.464 hectares (5.8%) valued at UGX.1.147Bn was	
			not being utilized by the entity.	
			o I noted that 1 piece of land measuring 0.612 hectares (7.5 %) valued at UGX 0.465Bn out of the 8.06798	
			hectares of land owned by the entity had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions.	
			o It was observed that Uganda Post was paid UGX.2.81Bn as compensation for the land and building.	
			However, I did not obtain the details of the application of these monies after the asset was sold off.	
			o There was no revaluation carried out over the past eight years. Non-asset revaluation implies the carrying

1. Soroti Fruit Factory 2021/22UnqualifiedOpinion			 The Company had an approved revenue budget of UGX.17.9Bn, for the year under review, out of which UGX.9.5Bn (comprising of UGX.1.27Bn sales revenue, UGX.0.014Bn other income and UGX.8.252Bn capitalized grants from UDC) was realized, leaving UGX.8.4Bn unrealized. Revenue shortfalls impact negatively on the company’s capacity to implement planned activities.	
				
			 A review of the financial statements revealed an operating loss margin of UGX.5.496Bn resulting from low sales of	
			UGX.1.285Bn during the year against the expenses of UGX.6.781Bn (comprised of UGX.1.263Bn cost of sales and	
			UGX.5.518Bn operating expenses). This implies that the company has continued to make losses.	
			 I inspected the inventory stores at the facility and established huge volumes of orange concentrate in the cold	
			room stores. The factory did not have a recognizable packaging line for ready-to-drink juices in PET bottles leading	
			to choking in the Cooling Rooms. The inability to transform Concentrate into marketable juice because of lack of	




465











			a commercial packaging line for Ready to Drink Juice, has meant that the company keeps huge volumes of	
			Concentrate which are kept in cold rooms, thus increasing costs of production and inadequate products in the	
			market.	
			 Of the 71 approved regular positions, only 31 were filled leaving 40(56.3%) vacant. By the time of audit, the entity	
			had lost 4 members of senior management namely the Chief Executive Officer, the Assistant Manager of Technical	
			Services and the Assistant Manager of production. Staffing gaps negatively impact on the company’s capacity to	
			do business.	
A review of sales, costs and production documents coupled with physical inspections revealed that the factory is loss making as the sales figure was only UGX.818m compared to the cost of sales of UGX.2.1Bn. This indicates that the profitability of the product is very low. In the year under review the company made a loss of UGX.6.833Bn.I noted that the factory still had, in store, concentrate and pulp that had been produced close to two years ago and indication of limited market for the juice produced2.

3. Nile Hotel International Ltd (NHIL)UnqualifiedOpinion			The entity did not have a strategic plan that is aligned to the NDP III in terms of time scope. Further noted was that the entity’s strategic plan is not aligned to that of UDC as their parent shareholder. This creates a risk of non- alignment of the entity’s strategic objectives to the national priorities as envisaged in the Vision 2040 and the NDP III.	
				
			 A review of the Company’s Board Charter reeled the following short comings;	
			o The charter did not specify which committees are to be put in place as per Section 2.4 in addition to Section	
			7.1 which further mentions permanent and adhoc committees.	
			o No general rules and procedures on members’ conduct and vacation of office were included.	
			o The charter was not signed/approved by the Board or its representation through a resolution.	
			 Absence of an up-to-date Board charter may reduce the powers of the Board and hinder good governance of the	
			company.	
			 The Board members continued to be involved in the day to day management/activities of the Company including	
			approval of accounting transactions. This practice contradicts with good corporate governance, which encourages

			 UEPB budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.0.04Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.0.01Bn was	
			collected, representing a performance of 25% of the target. The poor performance negatively affects the revenue	
			collection efforts of the country.	
			 The entity failed to implement a number of activities duing the year. These included; included media coverage	
			(TV, Radio and social media, press releases and Expo Week Magazine) and purchase of furniture. This directly	
			impacted service delivery.	
			 The term of office for the previous board expired on 5th October 2019 and no replacement Board has been	
			appointed to date. The lack of the Board impedes oversight and governance.	
			 UEPB has not exercised its mandate of levying the 0.5% on designated imports as well as receipt of monies paid	
			for goods or services provided by the Board, contrary to the Act leading to a loss of revenues and undermining the

 Out of the UGX.13.964Bn approved budget, only UGX.12.231Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.732Bn which represented 14.16% of the budget. As a result, three (3) outputs were partially implemented, hence negatively affecting public service delivery.The Authority did not have Land titles for four (4) pieces of land measuring 173.1 Acres in various parts of the country. This increases the risk of exposure to land grabbing and encroachment.I noted that contrary to Section 76 of UFZA Act 2014, which requires the Authority, in each year, within two months after the end of the financial year, to submit to the Minister, a statement of its activities in the preceding financial year, indicating any particular problems experienced by the Authority in that year in carrying out its objects and functions and making recommendations for resolving those problems and containing such other information as the Minister may direct, at the time of the audit in October 2022, the Authority had not prepared the report to the Minister for the financial year 2021/2022. Failure to produce and submit the required reports implies that the Minister and eventually Parliament to whom the annual report should be submitted by the Minister, did not assess the Authority’s performance.6.

				 The vote had accumulated domestic arrears of UGX.380, 245,920 relating to acquisition of IT system.	
				Accumulation of domestic arrears indicates non-compliance to the commitment control system and stifles the

				 I review the IT investment and not that;	
				o The IT investment projects were behind schedule	
				o Three systems with an acquisition cost of UGX.642,797,920 did not meet the user requirements and

8.	The Ministry charged wrong expenditure codes leading to mischarge of UGX.5.3Bn. I observed that, although the PS/ST authorized the change in the Ministry’s workplan to enable the Accounting Officer to utilize the funds requested, for renovation of premises as opposed to rent, the ministry has not recorded the resulting prepayment, since the amount is question is to be recovered through rental deductions, following an MoU signed with Uganda Property Holdings Limited, who own the premises that were renovated.Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares (100%) costing UGX.0.822Bn were not recorded in the Ministry’s land register. In addition, Property comprised in Plots 9, 11 and 13 Corporation rise - Bukoto Kampala, valued at UGX.1.935Bn (Land - UGX.1.77Bn and Developments UGX.159.8 Mn) had no land title and was not disclosed in the memorandum Statement. Failure to properly record all public land could cpmplicate proper follow up of such land.Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares held by the Ministry did not have Land titles, yet they were acquired over 16 years ago. This exposes such land to a risk of loss through encroachment and land grabbing.Five (5) plots acquired by Government of Uganda to resettle the metal fabricators previously operating along Katwe road under their association Katwe Small Scale Industrial Development Association (KSIDA), measuring approximately 0.435 hectares (14%) and costing UGX.0.505Bn was irregularly transferred to KSIDA as the user under Uganda Land Commission instead of Ministry of Trade as the rightful user.Land measuring 1.462 hectares (47%) acquired at UGX.0.217Bn out of the 3.107 hectares of land owned by the Ministry, had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions and encroachment as there was a legal challenge with a private company.I observed that the Ministry disclosed domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 of UGX.4.2Bn (2020/2021: UGX.16.4Bn). I noted that although the ministry settled a total of UGX.12.3Bn in lieu of subscription fees to  Ministry of Trade, CooperativesIndustry andUnqualifiedOpinion

international organisations, the Ministry was not able to fully settle the opening domestic arrears due to insufficient budgetary provisions. This exposes government to a risk of litigation and possible unnecessary litigation costs.A total of UGX.27.9Bn was paid to 13 Cooperative Societies, yet these were not in the original Ministry’s work plan. This creates unfairness and lack of transparency in the settlement of the outstanding compensation funds. War claims compensation of UGX.29.09Bn was made to third parties but not directly to the beneficiary Cooperative societies for onward remittance to beneficiary Cooperative members. I found the practice of payment through third parties both inconveniencing and exposing government to a risk of loss of public funds to non-bonafide members, given the lack of participation of members of the cooperative societies.				
9. Uganda National Bureau of Standards.UnqualifiedOpinion			 The entity budgeted to receive UGX.65.04Bn out of which UGX.64.08Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfallof UGX.0.96Bn, representing 1.4% of the approved budget. Under release of funds undermines service delivery	
			since not all the planned outputs could be produced, given the available funds.The Digital Conformity Stamps had not yet been implemented by the entity despite the service provider’s readiness.	
			As a result, UGX.19.88 Bn was not remitted by the service provider to UNBS since it is dependent on UNBS’s implementation of Digital Conformity Stamps.	
				
			 The Bureau had a staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. There is a risk that sub-standard	
			goods are entering the Ugandan market through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present.	
			 The entity had accrued pension and gratuity of UGX.1.29Bn contrary to regulations. Non-payment of pension leads	
			to the accumulation of arrears and affects the livelihood of the pensioners.	
			 There was no particular budget line for destroying substandard commodities that come into the country and those	
			seized from market surveillance activities. As a result, warehouses in the Bureau were filled with substandard	
			products that were not yet destroyed.	
			 Procurements amounting to UGX.1.32Bn that were initiated during the financial year had not been completed by	
			the close of the financial year. This leads to delays in service delivery.	
Out of the UGX.243.62Bn total funds available for spending, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48Bn representing 87% under absorption. The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery.I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations10.

 The Corporation has been holding 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 6.932 hectares without land titles for a long time without justification, exposing the corporation to the risk of loss of land thru land grabbing and encroachment.Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices.Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties.

   The entity did not budget for NTR during the year under review as reflected in the statements of appropriation, although UGX.0.435Bn was collected. Failure to budget for NTR implies that there was no target upon which the Authority’s performance could be evaluated.Out of the total warrants received of UGX.28.3Bn during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling UGX.25.36Bn resulting in un-utilized warrants of UGX.2.94Bn representing an absorption level of 90%, consequently some activities were either partially or not implemented at all, which negatively impacts service delivery.The Authority did not maintain a detailed risk register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets, as a result, there were no strategies and officers responsible for mitigating such risks or minimizing the impact in the event these risks materialized.Most pieces of land measuring approximately 11,931.343 hectares held by the entity were recorded in the entity land/assets register. However, 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 14.407 hectares were not recorded in the GFMIS fixed asset module thus affecting the accuracy of the non-produced assets in the financial statements.The entity has outstanding payables of UGX.3.596Bn in the statement of financial position, a decrease by UGX.1.1140Bn from UGX.4.736Bn reported in the previous financial year. Although there was a decrease in domestic arrears, the entity accumulated new domestic arrears of UGX.966.425Mn. Continued accumulation of domestic arrears is contrary to the commitment control system of government, and also exposes government to risks of costly litigation.The authority had receivables of UGX.21.396Bn in the statement of financial position relating to rent, the sale of goods and services and administrative fees at the end of the financial year, a reduction by UGX.50.589Mn (0.24%)12.

Understaffing negatively affects service delivery.A total of five (05) IT systems/equipment worth UGX.297.68Mn were procured without obtaining clearance by NITA-U and one system was not being utilised.

4. Uganda Wildlife Authority.UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of a total budget of UGX.119.469Bn, UWA received a total of UGX124.820Bn, representing 105% of the budget. However, the Authority spent only UGX.88.607Bn, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.30.862Bn representing an absorption level of 74.17%. As a result, I noted that of the 114 quantified activities worth UGX.54.37Bn that I assessed during the audit, 70 activities representing 61.4% were fully implemented, 23 activities representing 20.2% were partially implemented, while 21 activities representing 18.4% was not	
			implemented. Under absorption of availed funds implies failure to fully implement all planned activities which	
			negatively impacts service delivery.	
			 It was observed that the Authority had outstanding payables of UGX.25.454Bn, reported in the statement of	
			financial position, out of which UGX.8.111Bn were gratuity for staff not yet due and balance of UGX.17.343Bn	
			relates to trade payables, insurance claims payable, Gorilla levy payable and revenue share to the communities.	
			This despite the fact that the Authority had the cash resources which could have been utilized to settle the payables.	
			Delayed settlement of outstanding payables exposes government to a risk of costly litigation.	
			 I noted that there were several ongoing cases of claims on land in the gazetted areas under the management of	
			Uganda Wildlife Authority, as evidenced by active court cases in some of the National Parks namely: Lake Mburo	
			National Park, Mt. Elgon National Park, Semiliki National Park and Matheniko Bokora. This was attributed to	
			increased encroachment to the National park land. There is urgent need to resolve these cases to prevent loss of	
			gazetted land areas that could affect wildlife conservation.	
			 I noted that the Authority did not have an approved comprehensive management plan to manage the invasive and	
			exotic plant species problem that has covered an average of 30% of the surface areas of Queen Elizabeth, Lake	
			Mburo Park, Murchison Falls, and Kidepo Valley National Parks. The invasive species contracts the grazing areas	
			for herbivores animals and affect the rangeland and environmental quality that consequently reduce wildlife	
			population of grazers such as hippos, buffalos, zebras, topis, and Uganda Kobs.	
			 I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.61.169Bn were not executed as of 30th June 2022. This was	
			attributed to delays in procurement processes and partly due to effects of COVID-19 that affected the	
			implementation by the Authority that was operating a contingency budget that had scaled down on the capital	
			investments. Failure to implement planned procurements leads to non-provision of planned services.	
			 Over the last three years, UWA procured and installed three (03) different Accounting Systems, namely: The Sun	
			System, Microsoft Dynamics GP and the Microsoft Business Central System. The frequency of change of systems	
			was unjustifiably high and costly to Government. I observed that there were weaknesses in systems change over,	
			since management did not properly identify challenges that would require a switch to a new accounting package.

Out of the received grant of USD.4.5Mn, only USD.0.744Mn (UGX.2,710Bn) was expended reflecting unspent funds of UGX.8,889,891,079 and USD.1,191,819.40 held in the BOU UGX and USD bank accounts respectively, resulting into underperformance of 83.7%. This resulted into partial or non-implementation of planned activities, which in turn delays service delivery.The project implementation had been delayed and some planned project activities such as Procurement of firefighting and personal protection equipment, undertaking studies on Invasive species and developing their respective management plans, and Procurement of road construction equipment (3 graders, 2 excavators, 2 bulldozers, 2 water bowsers, 2 tippers) were not implemented.

UWA-SIDA Project 2022UnqualifiedOpinion			 Out of the received grant of USD.860,299 only UGX.557,053,138 (USD.135,324.7) was expended leading to unspent funds of UGX.2,317,274,301 and USD.39,857.23 held in the UGX and USD bank accounts respectively, resulting in underperformance of 82.3%. The failure to utilize the released funds resulted into non-implementation of several planned activities.	
				
			 The project implementation had been delayed and by 31st of May 2022, the project was not fully implemented	
			with various planned activities such as Procurement and installation of Guard observation towers in Queen Elizabeth	
			National Park (QENP), procurement of drones and IPADs for overhead surveillances and supporting of community	
			livelihoods around Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP), QENP and Toro-Semiliki wildlife Reserve (TSWR) not	
			completed. This led to a no cost extension by the funder to a new expiry date of 30th June 2023. Failure to absorb	
			Development Partner funds implies project objectives have not been met.	
Out of the total receipts of UGX.3.85Bn received during the financial year, UGX.3.522Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.328Bn representing an absorption level of 91%. As a result some planned activities were not implemented. The unspent funds were held in the Institute’s bank account.The Uganda Wildlife Authority donated 30 acres of land in Rwenjubu Kasese District, to Uganda Wildlife Research and Training Institute but there was no land title to confirm ownership. This land was not being utilised by the Institution although Management indicated that UWRTI had secured funding through CEDP for the construction of a centre for excellence. In the absence of a land title, the land is prone to encroachment.Unqualified7. Wildlife Research and Training InstituteOpinion

Uganda Wildlife Education Conservation Centre (UWEC).UnqualifiedOpinion			The Centre received total revenue of UGX.14.369Bn (including self-generated revenue of UGX.2RC.169Bn) during the financial year. Out of the total available funds for the year, the Centre spent UGX.10.9Bn resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.3.469Bn representing an absorption level of 75.86%. As a result, I noted that of the 59 quantified activities worth UGX.5.87Bn that I assessed, 25 activities representing 42.4% were fully implemented, 27 activities representing 45.8% were partially implemented, while 7 activities representing 11.9% were not

			 I noted that the Centre had total payables of UGX.2.51Bn, of which UGX 1.36Bn was due to the Consolidated Fund,	
			while the balance of UGX.1.15Bn was due to other creditors as at 30th June 2022. Delays in settlement of	
			outstanding liabilities could lead to costly litigation, in the event creditors decide to take such options.	
			 A review of management of IT investments at the Centre revealed that;	
			o There were no approved specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.	
			o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.	
			o There was no approved business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information	
			Security Policy 2014.	
			 Absence of ICT governance structures hampers formulation of appropriate ICT policies, strategies and real time	
			upgrade of ICT interventions. In addition, it may lead to misalignment of IT investments with the overall entity	
			strategic objectives.	
			 I noted that Government has taken a decision to merge Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre with	
			Uganda Wildlife Authority with the aim of reducing public expenditure to facilitate efficient and effective service	
			delivery. This process is in its final stages pending advice from Ministry of Public Service and Ministry of Tourism,	
			Wildlife and Antiquities. This situation, along with other matters as set forth in Note 8.2.11, indicates the existence	
			of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Agency’s ability to continue as a going concern.	
			Management was advised to engage with the Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities and Uganda Wildlife Authority to	
			adequately prepare for this transition.	
The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.126.68 Bn during the year under review out of which only UGX.68.22 was collected, representing a performance of 54% of the target. Management attributed the low performance to the long period of closure and economic slowdown due to COVID-19. NTR/revenue shortfalls at the Treasury level, negatively affect the implementation of planned activities by the Government.The Ministry accumulated payables of UGX.4.3Bn of which UGX.3.1Bn relate to contributions to International Organisations and have been outstanding for over two financial years, exposing the Ministry to risks of not benefiting from membership and also being expelled from the organisation.The Ministry did not implement five planned procurements worth UGX.1.576Bn. This adversely affects service delivery.The Ministry developed a strategic plan for 2020/21 – 2024/25, but at the time of the audit, the plan had not been approved by the National Planning Authority, implying that the activities being implemented may not be aligned with NDP III.9.

I noted that the project Statement of Financial Position included an amount of UGX 17.71 billion, being the Project cash balance as at 31st December 2021. However, management did not open a separate bank account for the project as required by the Grant Agreement (Clause 5.6) and Chapter 13 of UEGCL’s Finance Regulations Manual. Co-mingling of grant funds with other funds makes them susceptible to misuse, and it renders it difficult to easily ascertain the accuracy of the project balances.In the period under review, I noted that the absorption of budgeted funds was only NOK.2.274m of the budgeted NOK.30.278m, representing a 7.5% absorption level. Low funds absorption leads to delayed implementation of critical project activities, which may hinder project effectiveness.3.

- Analysis of the active deductions report (downloaded on 30th September, 2022 at 5.00pm) revealed that UGX.5,768,461 deducted from 02 employees had irregular end dates ranging from 120 months to 180 months

- In addition, UGX. UGX.1,083,492 was deducted by UCLA/UBA from 20 staff over and above the approved amounts by the Accounting Officer. This resulted into financial loss to the affected staff.

ADB –UCI East Africa's Centres of Excellence for Skills and Tertiary Education in Biomedical SciencesUnqualifiedOpinion			    The project expected to receive UGX.24.67Bn from Africa Development Bank/Fund (ADB/F) but only UGX.21.57Bn was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.3.10Bn (11.63%).Out of the total funds available of UGX.31,632,037,899, the project spent a total of UGX.24,381,361,189 resulting into unspent balance of UGX.7,250,676,710. The unspent balance majorly relates to uncompleted works (progress at 68%) for the Multi- Purpose building for cancer treatment and research.I noted the following anomalies regarding the construction of the Multipurpose building for which Roko Construction Ltd was the contractor:o o oooRoko’s contract expired on 30th December 2020 and the Bank objected to any further extensions. Management cashed the performance bond of UGX8bn after Roko Construction failed to perform as per contractInconsistencies in the valuation of completed works between Certificates 6 and 7 with Certificate 6 dated 7th September 2021 having the total value of certified works as USD.10,136,181 and Certificate 7 dated 24th May 2022 having a total value of works completed being USD.9,691,293 hence a decrease in the value of works of USD 444,887.An overpayment to Roko of USD.82,444.UCI did not claim for liquidated damages amounting to USD.68,137.4 from Roko Construction Limited even after the Institute became aware of Roko’s failure to deliver the contract.The consultant had been paid USD.913,983 (95%) of the contract sum yet the progress of construction works that the consultant was supervising was only 69% as at 30th June 2022. The contract for consultancy services for the design and construction supervision expired in April 2020 and had never been renewed.By 30.06.22, a total of USD.851,608 (80% of the contract sum) was paid to M/S MFI document solutions for the supply of ICT and Telemedicine Equipment. However, by at the time of the audit, the ICT equipment had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the KCB bank performance guarantee presented by the supplier to the institute expired on 31/03/2022. There is a risk of loss of fundsA total of USD.483,000 (20% of the contract sum) was advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, at the time of the audit the MRI scanner had not yet been delivered and installed. I further observed that the Stanbic Bank performance guarantee IG21293UG0101204 presented by the supplier to the Institute expired on 18th October 2022.USD.176,600 (20%) had been advanced to a supplier in March 2020 for the supply of Laboratory Furniture but at the time of the audit, the furniture had not yet been delivered.

Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Services Improvement Project (URMCHSIP)UnqualifiedOpinion			Out of the available budget of USD180Mn, a total of USD 131.7Mn was spent resulting into unutilized balance of USD 17,056,967 yet the project was closing in December 2022, a month away.I noted that, as at 30th September 2022, the digitalized system for verification of outputs and invoicing which had been rolled out by the Ministry to all the 131 districts was being utilised by only 98% of the districts to verify outputs and generate invoices.	
				
				
			 Despite the significant contribution of URMCHSIP to the mandate of the health sector and bearing in mind that the project	
			interventions will be closing by 31st December 2022 and finally end by June 2023, measures have not been put in place by	
			the Ministry to guide the sustainable financing of the project interventions after close of project.	
			 A local firm was contracted in June 2022 to develop a Birth and Death and Adoption Orders Registration System (BDAR)	
			through NIRA. However by the time of reporting in December 2022 this had not been done. The performance gurantees were	
			also still outstanding.

			 Contrary to the RBF implementation manual, a total of UGX. 2,771,416,463 transferred to various Health facilities meant for	
			the maintenance (medicines and other supplies) lacked the required accountabilities.	
  I noted that the entity had prepared its Strategic Plan for the period 2020/21 – 2024/25. However, although the plan was submitted to National Planning Authority (NPA) it had not yet been certified by the time of reporting. There is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/21 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives.I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/21 and noted that although the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.1.95Bn during the year under review, only UGX.1.58Bn was collected resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.37bn (representing under performance of 18.97% of the target). Shortfalls in NTR collections affect the implementation of planned activities at Government wide level.UCI budgeted to receive UGX.37.76Bn out of which UGX.37.11Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.65Bn (representing 1.72% of the budget). Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities.I noted that funds to the tune of UGX. 82,520,767 were irregularly reallocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.

This can lead to internal control overrides.During inspection of the Hospital Stores, I observed that the storage area was small and medicines were congested with the medicines on the floors instead of pallets and boxes leaning onto the walls. In addition, the store was not well lit and was poorly ventilated.Fourteen (14) tracer drugs selected experienced stock-outs ranging from 42 to 312 days. Stock-outs erode patients’ confidence in the public health care system, which compels them to seek inappropriate and expensive alternative health care services elsewhere.Management experienced delays of up to 54 days in delivery of medicines and sundries to the hospital by National Medical Stores.Examination of end-of-year stock balances for essential medicines revealed that some of the drugs had expired  

			 I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/21 and noted that

			in an unspent balance of UGX.0.232Bn representing an absorption level of 97.8%.	
			 I noted the Hospital received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.254,095,329, which was not declared to treasury and,	
			therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. These funds were received directly from development partners for

			 Three suppliers whose outstanding arrears were UGX.516,952,824 as at the end of FY 2019/20 were paid a total of UGX

			that UGX.119,352,684 was paid to three providers in excess of their outstanding domestic arrears, five suppliers with arrears	
			totalling to UGX.102,668,097 were not paid.	
			 The hospital structure has 349 approved positions. However, only 297 (85%) positions were filled and 52 (15%) positions	
			were vacant by the end of the year under review. The hospital lacked a neurosurgeon to build the capacity of the emergency

			services and reduce unnecessary referrals. Inadequate staffing undermines the achievement of strategic objectives and affects	
			service delivery.	
			 I noted that the information system at the hospital is manual and there is no linkage between the point of admission of a	
			patient, to treatment, laboratory, pharmacy, billing, payment and finally discharge as there are no patient records and as such	
			it is difficult to confirm completeness of the fees billed since the current system cannot completely and quickly show the	
			services consumed by a particular patient. Failure to integrate the systems leads to loss of revenue as it is difficult to quickly	
			establish the services different patients have consumed, paid for, and those that have not been paid for.	
			 There was a continued challenge concerning inadequate ward space especially for the Pediatrics, inpatient care for	
			malnourished children, new born care and isolation of patients with contagious diseases. Congestion at the hospital with	
			patients crowded in the wards and some sleeping on the floors exposes the patients to spread of contagious diseases.	
Out of UGX.8,686,536,283, UGX.7,319,187,794 (84%) was spent by the entity on salaries, pension and gratuity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1,367,348,489 that were returned to the consolidated fund.

newly recruited or transferred staff to the payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff as well as accumulation of salary arrears.

- Medical intern staff were paid past their due date by an average of 27 days, in all 6 months reviewed. I noted that in June 2021 and October 2021, they were paid 52 days and 45 days after the closure of the months. Delayed payment of salaries leads to demotivation of the affected staff as well as accumulation of salary arrears.

- An over and/or under remittance amounting to UGX.248,991,771 and UGX.1,544,347 respectively were noted during comparison of the deductions in the IPPS payroll registers with the remittances/payments in the IFMS details XML payment file.

- Net variances of UGX.56,622,986 between the IPPS payroll registers and interface files availed to the entity by the core FTP system. This creates an opportunity for manipulation and misappropriation of salary funds and could also lead to over/under payments of salary

- The Hospital did not maintain IPPS pension registers nor did it maintain IPPS verification reports for their pension staff. As a result, I was unable to analyse their pension and gratuity payroll with the payments executed in IFMS

- The Hospital did not include Hospital Management Board Member’s retainer fees of UGX.19,200,000 in the computation of PAYE leading to under deduction of PAYE of UGX.5,760,000. Omission of commissioner’s gratuity from the computation of PAYE leads to understatement of payables and receivables.

- The Hospital received off budget financing to a tune of UGX.2,692,383,900, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by the law. These funds were received directly from Ministry of Health and development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public Finance Management Act.

- Although UGX.843,109,684 from other government units was reported as part of the project balances in the memorandum statement for project balances on page 47 to financial statements, they it was not appropriated by Parliament and were not part of the budget. Inadequate disclosures may give room to misuse of funds.

- Out of budgeted total revenue of UGX.12,359,383,661 for the year 2021/2022, UGX.12,357,633,660 (99%) was realized.

- Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.12,357,633,660, UGX.12,229,767,057 (99%) was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.127,866,603 (1%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. The funds that were not absorbed were meant for the part payment of supply of an assortment of orthopedic equipment and accessories. I noted that while the equipment was delivered, it was not paid because the hospital administrator rejected some accessories valued at UGX.5,900,000.

- The budgets for 2 of the 12 outputs assessed were not supported by costings/budgets for each of the activities within these outputs. I was therefore unable to confirm if the funds allocated for these out-puts were reasonable and justifiable.

- Arua Regional Referral Hospital structure lacked over 69 positions that were prerequisite to the full operationalization of a referral hospital. The Hospital was operating on a staffing structure established in 1996 when the hospital was still operating as a District hospital. The structure had not been updated to match its new status as a regional referral hospital. As a result,

while the hospital staffing level stood at 77.3%, several critical staff could not be recruited and absorbed leaving several departments understaffed

- Several inadequacies in vital equipment like infant warmers, patient monitors, operating beds and headlamps among others were observed. There were also cases of stock outs of vital accessories needed to operationalize some medical equipment like batteries, distilled water for incubators, tubes for infusion pumps among others. The theatre also lacked several complementary equipment like cupboards needed to store sterilized equipment and accessories, drums for sterile equipment, mayo trays, operating stools, weighing scales etc.

- Maintenance works were hampered because of lack of ready spare parts for some medical equipment such as the Auto Clave machines. Some equipment was too old or damaged beyond repair for example operating lights in the Gynecology Theatres.

- The x-ray duo-diagnostic heavy-duty machine was non-functional, idle and redundant. The machine needed updating of software yet the service provider’s contract had expired. Idle and redundant medical equipment denies services to the patients and the equipment may be rendered obsolete over time.

- The hospital had non-functional medical equipment eg Weighing scales – infants, Ultra scanners, Infusion Pump etc. Non- functioning equipment denies services to the patients and the equipment may be rendered obsolete over time.

- During Inspections, it was noted that the hospital the structure was old, non-maintained, without sanitation facilities, no heavy duty staff gloves and therefore exposing staff to infections, had inadequate detergents, no flat iron, basins and buckets for carrying machine washed clothes and no uniforms and seats for staff.

- The Oxygen plant was non-functional and hospital was relying on the oxygen supplied by NMS and therefore affecting the hospital drugs budget. No proper storage for both empty and filled cylinders. Cylinders were scattered on the ground exposing them to theft and explosions. Although the daily oxygen production is documented to be 30 cylinders per day, there was no proper distribution system to respective ward/s users in terms of requisitions and dispatch exposing the cylinders to the risk of black market.

- The Pediatric Ward The ward has capacity of 40 beds but on average accommodates 90 children making others to sleep on the floor as shown in the picture. No trolleys for equipment and drugs, No wheel chairs. 3 oxygen concentrators function out of 6.

- Doors and windows broken without locks and therefore exposing patient and staff to risk of theft. Poor hygiene was also noticed in toilets and bathrooms due to their non-functionality.

- The maternity ward had Inadequate leading floor cases during the peak hours, Inadequate sanitary facilities, one toilet and bathroom supporting an average of 100 women on in the ward, Maternity had 6 deliveries but the minimum required beds are 10,the drainage system for the sluicing room was blocked and non-functional.

- Gynae Theatre’s cupboards had rusted and hence exposing the medical tools to contaminations, no trolleys, no fridge, and no anaesthetist for operations.

It lacked the following materials for operations; Polypropylene for making sockets, Eva Foams for making soft inserts, Pop powder for fabrication of devices, Knee Joint for Artificial limbs and Components for fabricating the limbsHospital Lagoon’s fence was vandalized due to the absence of security and as a result manhole covers have been stolen and the community was using the land for grazing.Arua Regional Referral Hospital private wing did not have an approved work plan and budget for the financial year 2019/2020.The strategic plan and budget is supposed to guide the budgeting process by creating integrated link with the general hospital annual work plans which feed into the budget to ensure effective service delivery and achievement of their vision, mission and objectives.The hospital did not maintain a detailed risk register for all risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. As such, there were no strategies and officers responsible to mitigate the occurrence of such risks or to minimize the impact in the event that these risks materialized. The failure to maintain risk registers implies that the entity does not have a mitigation or response strategy to risks that may affect the achievement of planned activities.Arua Referral Hospital showed that receipts and payments totaling UGX.2,692,383,900 did not go through GFMIS.

I further noted that out of the USD 2,610,101 (UGX. 9,479,082,377) received, the project only utilised USD 2,577,021 (UGX. 9,362,167,833) leaving a balance of USD 33,080 (UGX 116,914,544 ). The low release of funds coupled with under absorption of funds implies unrealistic over budgeting. In addition the low absorption of funds received constrains management in the delivery of planned project outputs.

  A review of the project financial records revealed that, as of 30th June 2021, although cumulative receipts of EUROs 4,200,000 (100%) had been released to the project by the Italian Republic, the cumulative expenditure was EUROs 3,355,254.49 (79.89%) thereby leaving EUROs 844,495.51(20%) unabsorbed by close of the year under review. I further noted that the remaining project funds are insufficient to complete the project due to cost escalations. Under the circumstances, the project is exposed to a risk of incomplete projects and unpaid obligations at project closure.The Italian Government delayed to disburse the second installment which affected the execution of the civil works under the initial contract. The Ministry of Health provided USD 1,304,322.96 (earlier meant for the procurement of x-rays) to the project to keep the works going. Upon receipt of the 2nd release from the Italian Government in December 2017, USD 1,276,847 was refunded leaving a balance of EUROs 22,302.24 outstanding to date. I informed management that delayed refund of internally borrowed monies negatively affects the delivery of the Ministry’s planned outputs.The Ministry of Health engaged a foreign firm to construct 68 staff houses at selected Health Centre IIIs in 9 Karamoja Districts at USD 5,592,885. The contract period was 18 months and a sum of USD 1,118,577 was advanced to the contractor on 16th June 2016. However, due to delayed payments by the Ministry arising from delayed release of funds by both the Italian Government and GoU co-funding, works stalled in 2018 and eventually the contractor abandoned the sites.I noted that at the time when the sites were abandoned, USD 415,025.48 had been recovered by the Ministry against the advance leaving a balance of USD 703,551.56. On the other hand, works valued at USD 315,827.87 had been certified. The contractor sued the Ministry for breach of contract. Whereas a reconciliation statement was prepared by the project consultant and shared with the contractor, the latter insisted that the Ministry settles the outstanding amount of USD 315,827.87. This court case had not been disposed by the time of audit. Whereas the contracts for civil works under Lot 1 and Lot 2 were scheduled to be completed on 16th May 2021, the sites had not been handed over and commissioned by 30th June 2021. Delayed contract execution compromises the timely achievement of project objectives and may lead to cost escalations.Italian Support to UHSSP and PRDP –Karamoja Region Staff Housing Project June 2021Unqualified22.Opinion

At the end of the financial year, the project closed with a cash and cash equivalent of EUR 530,266.59. Whereas the contracts for Lot 1 and Lot 2 were meant to be completed on 16th May 2021, only Lot 1 sites had been handed over and commissioned by end of FY 2021/2022. This implies delays for Lot 2 of 17 months from the planned completion date of 16th May 2021. By December 2022, the sites had not been completed.

contribution. Therefore, a budget shortfall of USD.135,657.97 (representing 1.7% of the external funding approved budget) was registered. This has a negative effect on the timely delivery of the planned outputs achievement of project objectives. Whereas the contract for the supply of medical and Hospital furniture worth USD 1,999,854.56 was initiated in the FY 2018/2019, deliveries had not yet been made by close of the year under review (30th June 2021). In addition, the performance guarantee had expired. Under the circumstances, the intended service delivery is compromised. In addition, the expiry of the bank guarantee exposes the Ministry of Health to a risk of a financial loss in the event that the company fails to deliver. Three (3) Supplies contracts worth USD 2,582,573.121 for the supply of laboratory equipment had not performed by 30th June 2021 as planned thereby delaying the intended service delivery at both Kayunga and Yumbe hospitals. Failure to ensure timely execution of the project supplies contracts impacts negatively on the achievement of the primary objective of the project of contributing to the delivery of the Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package (UNMHCP), through improvement of health infrastructure at the two hospitals.During the year under review, the project planned, under component 3, to procure six (6) vehicles (2 Ambulances, 2 mini- buses and 2 pickups) for the two hospitals. Draft contracts were prepared and submitted to the Funds for final approval. However, approval of Draft contracts by the Development funders was yet to be obtained and accordingly clearance from the Solicitor General had not been sought by 30th June 2021. Under the circumstances, the intended project outputs were not attained thereby delaying planned service delivery at the two (2) hospitals.There were delays by the Funding Agencies in effecting payments due to Contractors and Suppliers for services offered to the project. This led to failure to pay project obligations on time resulting into accrued outstanding obligations of USD 2,361,491.08 of which USD 1,558,909.95 was related to unpaid interim certificates for civil works, USD765,581.13 due to equipment suppliers and USD 3,700 in respect of unpaid Project staff salaries. Low disbursement rate exposes the project to a risk of loss of funds due to unfavourable foreign exchange fluctuations. Furthermore, the project is at risk of having incomplete project components and litigations due to unpaid obligations at project closure.

Council sued RAM Engineering and Stanbic Bank in a fraudulent case worth UGX 444,400,000 and the case was ruled in favor of UNMC. In the court ruling dated 4th October 2021, a garnishee order for refund of UGX.444,400,000 was issued against the respondent and the bank jointly and, or severally. I further noted that costs of the application were awarded to Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council (the Applicant). During the year under review, management made the necessary adjustments to the financial statements in the form of a receivable of UGX 444,400,000 and further disclosed a contingent asset in the form of interest and costs of the application. By the end of the year under review, funds were yet to be recovered as per the court ruling.On 3rd July 2020, management fixed a sum of UGX. 4,370,100,000 (UGX 4,000,000,000 and USD 100,000) with Standard Chartered Bank for 6 months with approval of the Governing Council vide resolution No. 11 under minute Ref: FC/16/26/06/2020 of the 7th full Council Virtual meeting held on 24th, 25th and 26th June 2020. Council earned interest income of UGX.163,429,767 that was credited on Standard Chartered Bank A/c No. 0102086768300 on 2nd January 2021. In addition, a sum of UGX 4.5bn was fixed on 21st June 2021 with the same bankers. I noted that the investment decisions were made without the guidance envisaged under a resource mobilization strategy. Furthermore, an investment register was not availed for audit verification.				
27. Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council.UnqualifiedOpinion			 Due to Government reforms to rationalize Government agencies and public expenditure, there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt that the Council shall remain a Going Concern in the foreseeable future.	
				
			 I observed that whereas the Council’s potential revenue from members was UGX.2,336,864,180, only UGX.2,094,087,170 was	
			budgeted for leaving UGX.242,777,010 unbudgeted for. The Council has not established a mechanism to collect and update	
			information in the register of members so as to have reliable data to inform the revenue budgeting process.The Council collected Non – Tax Revenue of UGX.1,846,419,724 against a budget of UGX.2,094,087,170 leading to under	
			collection of UGX.247,667,446.	
			 Contrary to section 32(1) of the Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, 1998, that requires inspection/supervisory visits to be	
			undertaken by the office of the Registrar at least once in every quarter of the year, I noted that inspection visits of health	
			facilities were done once in the year and only 155 out of 1,523 health units were inspected. This can lead to complacency and	
			compromise standards of health practitioners thus affecting the lives of patients.	
 I noted that the council has an approved staff establishment of 28 positions. However, only 16 positions (representing 57%) were filled leaving 12 positions (43%) vacant. Under the circumstances, the existing staff are exposed to a risk of job-related stress which could negatively affect service delivery.Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners council had four (4) motor vehicles. The council did not have a policy on Motor Vehicle Management to guide the usage of its fleet of four (4) vehicles so as to eliminate theft, losses, wastage and misuse.None of the four (4) vehicles owned by the council was inspected during the year under review. Under the circumstances, there is a risk of unforeseen mechanical failures that would expose the users of such vehicles to road accidents.I noted that the three (3) drivers employed by the Council had not undertaken additional training to obtain additional skills and were not subjected to annual medical examination to ascertain their fitness to drive.Unqualified 2020/2128.

I noted that as part of Management’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements outlined on Page 6 of the Financial Statements, the Accounting Officer stated that a material uncertainty existed regarding the continued operation of Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners’ Council in the foreseeable future. Management’s judgement was informed by a letter Ref: MSD/135/165/01 dated 19th April 2021 from the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Public Service to all Accounting Officers. In this letter, guidance was provided on the modalities for management of public Institutions during the implementation of recommendations on the rationalization of Agencies and Public Expenditure.

The balance of USD 2.572 M had not been disbursedBy 30th June 2022, the project registered outstanding obligations of USD 1,615,332.06 due to delays in payment by the funders	
				
				
				
				
				
				
 Whereas the project had a closing cash balance of USD 1,355,619.94, I noted the existence of outstanding claims from Excel Construction Ltd worth USD 1,414,640 and M/S ISDEFE (consultant) of Euros 88,437.97. This state of affairs affects the implementation of planned project activities which ultimately leads to delayed service delivery.There was a delay in the refurbishment of Busolwe General Hospital whose proposed scope was estimated to cost USD 5,532,792.38. This is despite the fact that the consultant so far has been paid EUROs 155,108 since December 2017. Delayed implementation of the project activities and disbursement of funds attracts commitment charges. In addition, these delays may result into cost overruns on the entire project.30.

			 I observed that a total of three (3) IT systems were not being optimally utilized by the entity and the Integrated Hospital	
			Management System (IHMS) running in the Hospital is not owned by the entity. In addition, the Hospital’s IHMS is not	
			integrated or automatically sharing information with other systems. This leads to redundancies, duplications and inefficiencies.	
			 A review of drugs supply chain management revealed that on several occasions there were drug stock outs which left Kiruddu

Out of the total expenditure budget of UGX.104.8bn, only UGX.85.7bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.19.1bn representing an absorption level of 82%.I assessed the implementation of a sample of forty three (43) activities with a total of one hundred twenty four (124) targets worth UGX.73.9Bn and noted that twenty three (23) activities with fifty one (51) targets and expenditure worth UGX.43.7Bn were fully implemented, twenty (20) activities with seventy three (73) targets worth UGX.30.2Bn were partially implemented. Out of the seventy three (73) targets, the entity fully achieved forty (40) targets; thirty two (32) targets were partially achieved, while one (1) target was not achieved.The Authority had long outstanding receivables from Ministry of Health and tenants to the tune of UGX.43,210,405,917 and UGX.131,298,624 respectively. Receivables represent idle assets which deny the entity availability of funds for prompt service delivery.I note that out of the four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 2.537 hectares held, one (1) piece of land located on Block 423, plot 13 in Busiro County (measuring approximately 1.619 hectares) had encumbrances in the form of encroachment by the local population.

			 Plot 2F on Nakasero Hill Road which houses the Headquarters of UBTS was encroached upon by a Hotel by way of a wall fence	
			covering a total area of 0.079ha.	
			 UGX 955,195,790 was reported as payables of which UGX.624,097,536 was accrued during the year. The payables arose from	
			over commitment beyond the approved estimates as appropriated by Parliament for the financial year.	
			 Out of 424 approved staff positions only 286 (67%) posts were filled, leaving 138 (33%) positions vacant.	
			 I noted that whereas a contractor for the remodelling and expansion of a store at Nakasero prepared and submitted building	
			plans to UBTS, there was no evidence that these plans had been submitted to KCCA and subsequently approved.	
			Implementation of unapproved building plans poses a risk of financial loss in the event that the responsible Authority	
			(Metropolitan Authority/KCCA) refused to approve the plans and directed the demolition of the works already done.	
			 Records of 313,975 units of blood collected and recorded on the Blood Safety Information system indicated that 252,178 units	
			of blood were dispatched to 488 health units. However, there was no record of blood received and issued by health Units on	
			the District Health Information System (DHIS2) to enable verification of data entered in the DHIS2. Tracing of blood to the

As a result, I noted that of the thirty-one (31) quantified activities worth UGX.14.51Bn assessed; twenty-nine (29) activities (representing 87%) were fully implemented and two (2) activities (representing 13%) were partially implemented.The Institute did not have land titles for the four (4) pieces of Land under its use. I further established that apart from Kamwanyi land measuring about 1.416 hectares and the UVRI Headquarters land measuring about 29.137 hectares, management was not certain of the size of the land in Arua and at Zika Forest. Lack of Land titles could result into encroachment, disputes and loss of public land.The reported payables of UGX.202,811,084 relating to property tax that the Institute owes Entebbe Municipal Council have been outstanding since FY 2010/11. Under the circumstances, the entity runs a risk of litigation that could result in a financial loss in the form of penalties.Contrary to PPDA Regulations, contract managers did not submit monthly reports to the Accounting Officer on the progress of contracts worth GBP.7,938.63; USD.33,473.07 and UGX.3,280,937,286.

Encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the land and pose a risk of loss of land.UGX.2,429,618,348 was assessed by URA as outstanding tax obligation (PAYE) arising from wrong deduction of taxes from professional allowances at 6% instead of 30% as per sec 19 (1) a of the Income Tax Act. Management has started implementing the tax rates but it has resulted into low morale with some professional employees leaving the Institute which may in the long run affect its ability to effectively deliver on its mandate.I noted that UHI has a Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) for patient management and other ancillary services in the OPD, Theatre, Cath Lab, IPD, Lab and other ancillary services. Despite the fact that the system is meant to share information to aid the smooth running of the entity, the system operates in isolation of other systems such as IFMIS and Human Capital Management (HCM) system of Ministry of Public Service. This leads to duplications and inefficienciesI observed that there were no factory trainings conducted for users and engineers (technicians) for some of the equipment procured by the Institute which makes the equipment susceptible to breakdown and prolonged down time.I noted that some vital medical equipment was inadequate according to the bio-medical department analysis and recommendation, while others were due for replacement. This compromises the level of service to patientsOut of the 10 (ten) items selected as tracer Essential Medicines at the Institute, three (3) experienced stock-outs ranging from 40 to 45 days.

  Out of the total receipts for the financial year UGX.8.088Bn, the Commission spent UGX.7.744Bn resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.0.343Bn (representing an absorption level of 95.75%). As a result, I noted that out of the 19 quantified activities worth UGX.7.309Bn assessed; 7 activities representing 37% were fully implemented while 12 activities representing 63% were partially implemented.On 31st March 2015, Butabika Hospital Management Board permitted the Commission together with four (4) other government entities to utilise three acres of Butabika Hospital land on a lease to construct office premises. However, by close of the year under review, no action had been taken by the Commission despite its current substantial annual rent expenses of UGX.680,000,000.I noted that although the Board of Survey recommended twenty-seven (27) IT equipment valued at UGX.63,300,000 for decommissioning in the financial year 2021/22, no disposals had been made.Out of 79 positions only 52 are filled leaving 27 positions vacant.44.

45. Uganda AIDS Commission.UnqualifiedOpinion			 According to the revised approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.14.736Bn however UGX.14.551BN was	
			warranted resulting into a revenue shortfall of UGX. 0.185Bn. The Commission received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX. 939,268,646 which was not declared to Treasury and therefore not appropriated by Parliament Although UAC did not budget to collect NTR during the year under review UGX.40,180,000 was collected as NTR.	
			 I reviewed the implementation of nine (9) outputs that were fully quantified with a total of forty-four (44) activities worth	
			UGX.14.55Bn and noted that the reported performance at activity level was not aligned with the planned performance. As a	
			result, it was difficult to assess the level of implementation of the planned out puts.	
			 UGX.13,347,458 was irregularly diverted from workshops and seminars code and spent on staff lunch without seeking and	
			obtaining the necessary approvals.	
			 The entity had reported payables of UGX.76,162,182 which have been accumulating since July 2005.	
Out of the UGX.243.62Bn total funds available for spending, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48Bn representing 87% under absorption. The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery.I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations The Corporation has been holding 2 pieces of land measuring approximately 6.932 hectares without land titles for a long time without justification, exposing the corporation to the risk of loss of land thru land grabbing and encroachment.Unqualified46.

Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices.Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties.

I noted that the bank reconciliations from June 2021 to September 2021 were not correctly done. There were un-reconciling differences between the cashbook and the bank statement balances. In addition to this, the bank reconciliations provided for my review lacked evidence of review and approval by senior management.I noted that the project field staff allowances were not charged PAYE tax. Non-compliance with Income Tax Act may precipitate tax penalties from Uganda Revenue Authority, leading to financial loss for the project.I noted quarterly reports were not submitted to CDC on time. Late submission of reports may delay reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the project by the development partners.Parliamentary Pension Scheme.Unqualified1.Opinion				
				
2. Parliamentary Commission.UnqualifiedOpinion			Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.822.278Bn, only UGX.818.533Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.3.744Bn representing an absorption level of 99.5%. As a result, I noted that out of 27 quantified activities worth UGX.703.275Bn assessed; 21 activities representing 77.7%, were fully implemented, and six activities representing 22.3%, were partially implemented.	
				
			 I noted that completed physical works for the New Parliamentary Chambers stood at 53%, which is only an increase of 20%	
			from the previous year at 33%. In addition, the contractor stated that works could not be completed by the end of the contract,	
			i.e. May 2023.	
			 A review of ICT activities implemented revealed the following; non-optimal utilization of IT system, absence of IT risk	
			management framework/policy and use of an old IT staff structure.	
			 I noted that the Commission did not maintain an updated asset register as required and had not implemented the	
			disposal/divestment plans and recommendation of the Board of survey reports for the last four (4) financial years.
