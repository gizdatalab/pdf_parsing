;;;; I noted weaknesses regarding the reporting and performance evaluation on the implementation of NDP III i.e.
;;;;failure by LGs to produce the annual performance reports, only 4 (20%) out of the 20 programs had been able to
;;;;produce annual performance reports and the lack of follow-up mechanisms for proper compliance to the respective
;;;;guidelines.
;;;; The MTR highlighted that the PWG processes have not materialized as most programmes (16 out 20) are not
;;;;operational, and their respective secretariats are not visible.
;;;; There was slow progress in implementing NDP III Monitoring and Evaluation reforms.
;;;; I noted that there was no current 10-year national development plan informing the formulation of the NDP III and
;;;;NDP IV. Additionally, the Authority only had a 5-year human resource development plan as opposed to the thirty-
;;;;year and 10-year long-term development plans as required by the regulations.
;;;; The Authority lacked a National research agenda.
;;;; I noted that the oversight and coordination mandate or research in different institutions was originally conducted
;;;;by UNCST and was now duplicated in the Authority.
;;;; I noted absence of representation of ICT governance structures at top management and absence of ICT assets in
;;;;the asset management strategic plan of the Authority.
;;;; I reviewed the staff exits from the Authority in the last five financial years and noted a total of 24 staff had left
;;;;the authority outside the jurisdiction of mandatory retirement or death.
9.;"     The Commission failed to spend UGX.0.41Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. As a result, I noted that of the six (6) outputs with fifty-one (51) activities worth UGX.1.65Bn assessed; twenty-three (23) activities were fully implemented, fifteen (15) activities were partially implemented while thirteen (13) activities remained unimplemented. I noted that the Commission’s audit tool lacked a section for following up on prior supervision recommendations made to DSCs before the current assessment. The revised PSC Guidelines to DSCs and the Assessment tool for Minimum Conditions and Performance Standards have not yet been approved by the Commission awaiting the approval of the PSC Regulations. I noted that several stakeholders particularly the Ministry of Public Service, Ministry of Local Government, Education Service Commission, and Health Service Commission are undertaking similar and complementary roles with the DSCs however, a review of the existing coordination arrangements revealed weaknesses in how PSC coordinates with other players. The relationship of PSC with other stakeholders needs to be harmonized. Public Service Commission (PSC) The Commission did not budget for NTR however; UGX.1,420,000 was collected.
