"       The Corporations Trade and other Payables increased to UGX.84Bn from UGX.75.119 (i.e. an increase of …%). Further analysis on trade and other payables revealed that some payables had remained outstanding for more than eight years old without any movements. The increased payables expose the Corporation to a risk of costly litigation as well as penalties and fines from statutory bodies. The Corporation has contingent liabilities outstanding as of 30th June 2022 of UGX.6.252Bn. This figure significantly increased by 300% from UGX.1.827Bn as at 30th June 2021. This figure will worsen the liability position if it materialises. The Corporations’ strategic plan running for the period 2017-2022 had expired and Management was in process of designing a new one aligned to NDPIII. It implies the organisastion is being managed without a strategic direction. The Corporation has an approved staff establishment for 353 positions of which 99 (28%) positions remained vacant due to indequate wage. This undermines service delivery. The Corporation does not have Land titles for 36 pieces of land it currently owns. Further, the Corporation owns 80 acres of land as per Vesting Order at Bobi-Gulu and the land is not being utilized and hosts equipment that is not on air. Lack of Land titles may result in encroachment, disputes and even loss of public land. The Corporation has land titles for 19 pieces of land which were leased out, however there were no lease agreements for 10 of these pieces of land. In addition, out of 19 pieces of land leased out, 6 pieces had expired leases. This exposes such land to a risk of loss.  I reviewed Uganda Broad Casting Corporation IT systems and noted the following; o The systems were not intergrated, o no systems maintenance strategy and policy was in place, o SONAPS system used for studios production chain for ingesting media from various sources onto UBC computing storage, editing content, archiving and storage, playout, scheduling of adverts and announcements, and monitoring became unusable after 3 years in use. o The entity did not have an approved IT staff structure in place despite ICT prioritization in NDP III. o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register. There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014. 59. Uganda Broadcasting Corporation (UBC). Unqualified Opinion";;;

60. Uganda Post Limited. Unqualified Opinion;;; Receivables were reported at UGX.8.71Bn by close of the financial year, contrary to paragraph 4.2.1 of Posta
;;;Uganda’s debt management policy 2016, which stipulates that standard terms for sundry debtors are 30 days from the date of invoice. Accumulation of receivables denies the company the cash flows which are vital for service delivery.
