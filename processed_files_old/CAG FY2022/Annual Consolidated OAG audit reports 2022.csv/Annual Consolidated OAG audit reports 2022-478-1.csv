;;;• The system network connectivity was noted to be unstable and this delayed implementation of various
;;;procurements, which greatly affected service delivery at the Institute.
;;; I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.1.06Bn were not initiated as of 30th June 2022. As a result,
;;;implementation of critical institute programs was delayed.
The entity budgeted to receive UGX. 3.5 Bn, out of which UGX.2.38 Bn was availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.1.11 Bn, which is 31.7% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities. The Institute has total receivables of UGX.440,038,625 in the statement of financial position, which includes an amount of UGX.343,855,528 relating to student debtors. The student-related receivables grew by 11% from UGX.308,954,465 (2019/20) to UGX.343,855,528 (2020/2021). The institute and staff who were in acting position for more than 6 months, contrary to Section 3.3.5.1 of the UICT Human Resource Manual 2018 that requires that acting appointments not to exceed six (6) months, save for special circumstances approved by the Governing Council. In addition, a review of the staff establishment showed 107 (61%) positions were filled, 68 (38.9%) positions vacant. Unfilled postilions negatively impact the Institute’s capacity to have effective service delivery.    53. Uganda Institute of Communication Technology (UICT). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;

54. Uganda Post Limited Unqualified Opinion;;;Receivables were reported at UGX.8.71Bn by close of the financial year, contrary to paragraph 4.2.1 of Posta Uganda’s debt management policy 2016, which stipulates that standard terms for sundry debtors are 30 days from the date of invoice. Accumulation of receivables denies the company the cash flows which are vital for service delivery. 

;;; The financial statements revealed that UPL’s payables increased by UGX.1.9Bn from UGX.14.79Bn as at 30th June
;;;2021 to UGX.16.69Bn in financial year 30th June 2022. Accumulation of payables creates a risk of litigation that
;;;may lead to payment of penalties and fines for delayed settlement to possible aggrieved parties in future.
;;; A review of UPL’s staff list as at 30th June 2022 and the approved Organisation Structure revealed that out of the
;;;staff establishment of 247, only 172 positions were filled, leading to a staffing gap of 75 (30.4%). Inadequacy in
;;;staffing leads to inability to fully carry out the mandate hence negatively negatively impacting on staff performance,
;;;service delivery and attainmant of company objectives.
;;;" The following aspects were noted in regard to management land by UPL;"
;;; The Company did not renew leases for three (3) pieces of land. The entity has taken an average of 14 years from
;;;the time of expiry of the lease term without having them renewed. This exposes such land to a risk of loss.
;;; I noted that 10 pieces of land did not have their sizes recorded in the land register either in acres or hectares as
;;;required. I also noted that 8 pieces of land did not have a value attached to them in form of cost of valuation
;;;amount.
;;; I noted that 1 piece of land measuring approximately 0.464 hectares (5.8%) valued at UGX.1.147Bn was not being
;;;utilized by the entity.
