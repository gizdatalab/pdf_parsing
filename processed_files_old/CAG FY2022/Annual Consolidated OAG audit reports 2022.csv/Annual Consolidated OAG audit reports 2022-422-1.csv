23. Uganda High Commission Canberra Unqualified Opinion;;; Contrary to the requirements of the circular, the Uganda High Commission, Canberra had a Mission Chatter for 2021/2022 which was not aligned to the Mission’s Strategic Plan 2020/21 - 2025. As a result the budget for the same financial year was also not aligned to the strategic objectives in the Strategic Plan.
;;;
;;; I noted that according to the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) projections, only UGX.23.08 was
;;;allocated to the High Commission over the five years, mainly for wage and non-wage (recurrent) spending
;;; The approved structure of the High Commission considers only the Head of Mission and the graded as Foreign
;;;Service Officers. Other officers who are posted and work at the High Commission such as the Financial and the
;;;Administrative Attaches were not included in the approved structure of the High Commission.
;;; I established that the High Commission paid a total of AUD 48,551.57 during the financial without separating what
;;;related to normal power use and the portion meant for cooling/heating. This is irregular and affects implementation
;;;of other planned activities of the High commission.
;;; I noted that MOFA released AUD.1,068,219.79 (UGX.3.00Bn) to the High Commission in excess of the required
;;;commitment of AUD 320,000 for the Acquisition of the Chancery by Government of Uganda. The excess of AUD
;;;748,219.79 was deposited with Lawyers under an Escrow Account in the bank. However, this excess amount was
;;;wrongly expensed during the year instead of recognizing it as cash and cash equivalents on the escrow Account.
24. Uganda High Commission Canberra 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;; I noted that the mission finalised the preparation of the strategic plan for the period 2020/2021-2024/2025. However, the strategic plan was approved on 27th September 2021 after the end of the financial year under audit.
;;;
;;; I noted that funds to the tune of AUD.10081.38 (UGX.27, 161,455) were irregularly diverted from the activities on
;;;which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; I noted that the Mission spent UGX.171, 287,858 on medical refunds and other medical expenses to its staff during
;;;the financial year. Out of the total refunds paid, the insurance refunded only the qualifying amount of
;;;UGX.72,880,522
