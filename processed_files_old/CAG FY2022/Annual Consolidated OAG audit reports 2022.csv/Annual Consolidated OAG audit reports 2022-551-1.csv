Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Services Improvement Project (URMCHSIP) Unqualified Opinion;;;  Out of the available budget of USD180Mn, a total of USD 131.7Mn was spent resulting into unutilized balance of USD 17,056,967 yet the project was closing in December 2022, a month away. I noted that, as at 30th September 2022, the digitalized system for verification of outputs and invoicing which had been rolled out by the Ministry to all the 131 districts was being utilised by only 98% of the districts to verify outputs and generate invoices.

;;; Despite the significant contribution of URMCHSIP to the mandate of the health sector and bearing in mind that the project
;;;interventions will be closing by 31st December 2022 and finally end by June 2023, measures have not been put in place by
;;;the Ministry to guide the sustainable financing of the project interventions after close of project.

    I noted that the entity had prepared its Strategic Plan for the period 2020/21 – 2024/25. However, although the plan was submitted to National Planning Authority (NPA) it had not yet been certified by the time of reporting. There is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/21 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the achievement of NDP-III objectives. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2020/21 and noted that although the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.1.95Bn during the year under review, only UGX.1.58Bn was collected resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.37bn (representing under performance of 18.97% of the target). Shortfalls in NTR collections affect the implementation of planned activities at Government wide level. UCI budgeted to receive UGX.37.76Bn out of which UGX.37.11Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.65Bn (representing 1.72% of the budget). Revenue shortfalls affect the implementation of planned activities. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX. 82,520,767 were irregularly reallocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Unauthorized reallocation of funds is not 8. Uganda Cancer 2021 Institute Unqualified Opinion;;;
