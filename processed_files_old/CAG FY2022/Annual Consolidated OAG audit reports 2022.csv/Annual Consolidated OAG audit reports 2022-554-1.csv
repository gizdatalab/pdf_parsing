;;;services and reduce unnecessary referrals. Inadequate staffing undermines the achievement of strategic objectives and affects
;;;service delivery.
;;; I noted that the information system at the hospital is manual and there is no linkage between the point of admission of a
;;;patient, to treatment, laboratory, pharmacy, billing, payment and finally discharge as there are no patient records and as such
;;;it is difficult to confirm completeness of the fees billed since the current system cannot completely and quickly show the
;;;services consumed by a particular patient. Failure to integrate the systems leads to loss of revenue as it is difficult to quickly
;;;establish the services different patients have consumed, paid for, and those that have not been paid for.
;;; There was a continued challenge concerning inadequate ward space especially for the Pediatrics, inpatient care for
;;;malnourished children, new born care and isolation of patients with contagious diseases. Congestion at the hospital with
;;;patients crowded in the wards and some sleeping on the floors exposes the patients to spread of contagious diseases.
