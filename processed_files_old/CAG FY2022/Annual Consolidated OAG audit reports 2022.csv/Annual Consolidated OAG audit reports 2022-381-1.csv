     I assessed the implementation of the case backlog reduction strategy by DGAL and noted that despite the goal of clearing all backlog cases by June 2021, the backlog had only reduced by 63.97%, implying that the zero-backlog goal was not achieved. I also noted that despite various efforts, the case turnaround time has remained stagnant at 30 days for over four financial years with no improvement. I observed that DGAL prioritises new cases over older cases. As a result, backlog cases which have remained unresolved for five (5) years or longer constitute 50% of all the backlog cases of DGAL. Although the Directorate spent UGX.1.05Bn on the operations of the regional laboratories, I noted that the regional laboratories are not sufficiently equipped for forensic analysis and are currently used by Scene of Crime Officers as temporary collection points for samples and exhibits before transferring them to the main laboratory for analysis. I reviewed the management of public land and noted that the entity did not maintain a land register or capture the owned land in the assets register in the Government’s Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). I reviewed the management of IT systems and noted that DGAL had a number of IT Governance shortfalls. For instance, there were no structures to oversee ICT implementation, no approved IT staff structure, internal audit did not review ICT systems, and the entity did not have an approved IT risk management framework.;;;
3. Justice Law and Order Sector (JLOS- SWAP). Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the total available funds for the financial year of UGX.106.3Bn, only UGX.76Bn was spent by the Project resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.30.3Bn, representing an absorption level of 71.5%. As a result, I noted
;;;that of the 370 activities, ninety (96) were fully implemented, 219 were partially implemented, and 73 were not
;;; implemented. I noted that NIRA issued birth certificates to 42,216 children born to refugees out of the planned 50,000. Whereas
;;;NIRA had planned to cover six (6) refugee sites, the issuance was only done in three (3) refugee sites. This affected
;;;service delivery.
;;; Whereas a sum of UGX.86,754,847 was spent on reviewing stalled cases to enable the affected citizens to obtain
;;;national IDs, only 2,498 cases were reviewed out of the planned 7,122 cases.
;;; The Judicial Service Commission procured furniture and a motorcycle worth UGX.35,842,000 for use by the regional
;;;offices of Arua and Mbarara. At the time of audit these offices had not been operationalised, implying that the
;;;equipment was not used for the intended purpose.
;;; I reviewed the clearance of case backlog by the Judiciary using the JLOS SWAP funding and observed that 2,632
;;;cases which had been part of the backlog were handled to completion and 6,035 cases remain as part of the
;;;backlog.
;;; The Judiciary spent a sum of UGX.160,000,000 on installing a wide and local area network in court stations, and
;;;only 2 out of the 20 court stations were covered. The failure to establish networks may negatively impact the
;;;Electronic Court Case Management Information System (ECCMIS) rollout.
