;;;; There was a fire outbreak at Uganda Police’s Garment Factory in Lugogo along Jinja Road, which damaged both
;;;;equipment and materials, causing an estimated loss of UGX.1.95Bn. An investigation into the cause and extent of
;;;;the fire's damage is yet to be concluded.
;;;; I reviewed public land management and noted that UPF land at Kabalagala, Nakawa and Pallisa is encumbered,
;;;;which poses a risk of loss of land. A number of land parcels owned by UPF are not titled.
;;;; There is unclear ownership of Police land in Naguru arising from a claim for the same land by M/s Oscar Industries
;;;;Ltd.
;;;; Whereas the Government leased land to UNAFRI for setting up their operations, the agency has since failed to
;;;;develop the land and has subleased the land to Yuasa and Future group car bonds while the structures are being
;;;;rented out to individuals for revenue.
;;;; I noted deficiencies in the ICT Governance structures. The ICT department is understaffed, and there is no IT risk
;;;;management framework, risk register and business continuity plan.
;;;; I noted that UPF does not adequately budget for liabilities arising from compensations and court awards. There
;;;;were delays in the settlement of court awards, with some not settled for over 10 years. UPF does not maintain a
;;;;comprehensive and detailed register of all cases for compensation and court awards.
20.;      Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.62.62Bn, only UGX.57.27Bn was spent by NIRA resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.5.34Bn representing an absorption level of 91.46%. Out of the budgeted funds of UGX.75.02Bn, only UGX.62.62Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX12.4Bn, which represents 16.5% of the approved budget. Out of the total approved NTR estimates of UGX.15Bn, only UGX5.3Bn was collected, representing a performance of only 35%. I sampled ten (10) outputs that had been fully quantified worth UGX.22Bn and noted that two outputs worth UGX.3.1Bn were fully implemented, and seven outputs worth UGX.18.9Bn were partially implemented. I reviewed the progress of enrolment and registration of citizens and noted that approximately 4.3 million Ugandans are still unregistered, and 419,055 have applied, but their applications are still under data processing. It takes an average of 21 days to process an application instead of the expected seven days if NIRA is working efficiently, indicating delays in the process. I noted that about 1.6 million cards were printed but not issued, and 1.5M of these have been unissued for a period exceeding six months. In addition, about 1.3 million applications were rejected for inaccurate data and errors that need rectification, but NIRA has not notified these clients.
