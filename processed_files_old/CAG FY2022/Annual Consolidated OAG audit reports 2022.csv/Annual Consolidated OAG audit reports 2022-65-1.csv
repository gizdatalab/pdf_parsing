;"Loans/savings not supported by letters of under- taking/consent may lead to; unauthorized deductions and lack of assurance/guarantee to lending institutions which may limit access to loan services and affects the livelihoods of civil servants. The Accounting Officer explained that this was an oversight and promised to keep copies of letters of undertaking and consent letters in the subsequent years. I advised the Accounting Officers to ensure that letters of undertaking are duly prepared, signed by the bank and a copy retained on the staff personnel file for ease of reference.  Deduction past the deduction end date observed that MoPS deducted UGX. 1,458,405,180 relating to 2,143 employees in 83 LGs past the end date on behalf of UCLA/UBA. Details are in Appendix 1 k. Deductions past the end date result into financial loss to the affected staff.  Unrealistic loan end dates noted that unrealistic loan end dates for 2,729 employees in 69 LGs with the worst ranging from ranging from 11 to 5,642 years. In the year under review, UGX.4,745,884,699 had been deducted from these employees. Details are in Appendix 1 k. The above end dates are unrealistic and cast doubt on the integrity of the PDMS system controlled by PCA. This has led to continuous deductions from staff and there are possibilities of making deductions from staff without running loans.  Unapproved loan deductions by Accounting Officer in the PDMS I I I observed that UCLA/UBA deducted UGX.8,885,902,311 from 8,468 staff in 95 LGs without approval of the Accounting Officers from the PDMS contrary to Section 2.1.2 & 2.1.4 of the service agreement. Details are in Appendix 1 k. This creates opportunities to misappropriate funds through making fictitious deductions as well as over deductions. In addition, UGX.1,643,636,038 was deducted by UCLA/UBA from 8,756 staff over and above the approved amounts by the Accounting Officers in 68 LGs. Details are in Appendix 1 k.";;;;;;
