  Despite the strategic goal of clearing all backlogs, various entities still report outstanding/pending cases of backlog, and in some instances, the backlog has increased rather than reduced. The JLOS SWAP project depends on development partners to finance most of the budgeted activities. In the financial year 2020/2021, Development Partners directly contributed a total of UGX.16.5Bn. Of this, UGX.14.1Bn or 85% was contributed by the Embassy of Netherlands,1.69Bn by UNFPA, 0.52Bn by UNICEF, and 0.15Bn by DGF. Also, some donors contributed through budget support. For instance, EUR. 2,000,000 by Austria, EUR. 6,000,000 by European Union, EUR. 6,500,000 through Dutch support, which approximately totaled UGX. 55.8Bn.;;;

;;;"the six (6) quantified outputs worth UGX.32.127Bn assessed; two (2) outputs were fully implemented, three (3)"
;;; outputs were partially implemented, while one (1) was not implemented. I assessed the delivery of services from implemented activities and I noted that three field offices in Namutumba,
;;;Kazo and Ntoroko districts were not established as planned. I also observed that the PROCAMIS system was only

;;;in the year under audit. I also noted inconsistencies in the data kept on an outstanding number of cases.
;;; I reviewed the management of public land and noted that the entity maintained a land register however it did not

;;;positions were filled (40.5%) leaving a staffing gap of 884 positions (59.5%).
