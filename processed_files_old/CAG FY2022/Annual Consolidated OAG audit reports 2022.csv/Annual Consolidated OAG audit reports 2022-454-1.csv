Upgrading of Tirinyi-Pallisa-Kumi/Pallisa- Kamonkoli Road Project (111kms) i (Uganda National Roads Authority). 2022 Unqualified 13. Opinion;;; A review of the Interim payment certificates (IPCs) established that there was delayed certification of contractor’s IPCs and subsequently delayed payments beyond the stipulated time period of 56 days with a time lag ranging from 23-122 days for GOU portion and 44-101 days for IsDB portion. These delays have attracted interest charges amounting to UGX.4,858,216,355. This is wasteful as it should have been avoided had the Supervising Consultant approved the IPCs in time.
;;;
;;; Audit noted that there were delays, by the Bank, ranging from 100 to 157 days to release funds requested by
;;;UNRA for payment of contractor’s certificates to be remitted to the contractor’s bank account.
;;; Contrary to the requirements of the Regulation 16 of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted
;;;that, although there were surplus funds amounting to UGX.3,687,491, 470 for Tirinyi Palisa Kumi Kamonkoli road
;;;project that should have been returned to the consolidated fund at year end, management reallocated these funds
;;;to the Nakalama Tirinyi-Mbale project to pay debts owed to the contractor without the Minister’s approval.
;;; I noted that a total of UGX.4,563,236,836 for Lot 1 and UGX.1,075,035,660 for Lot 2 was paid to the contractor
;;;as costs due to the approved Extension of Time amounting to 215 days and 45 days respectively beyond the
;;;original completion dates. This was attributed to delayed compensation of project affected persons.
     By the end of the year 2021/22, the project had incurred total financial charges of USD. 1,020,775.068 on delayed absorption of disbursed project amount worth USD. 10,964,141.51 I noted that the project is slow and has resulted into an under-utilization of the signed loan amount thus incurring commitment charges of USD. 785,248.3 on the unwithdrawn principle Loan Amount. Interest payment of UGX. 20,152,565,660 due to delayed payment of claims under the contract for Provision of works and Services. Contrary to the requirements of the Regulation 16 of the Public Finance Management regulations 2016, I noted that UGX. 26,580,590 (USD 7,056.24) of the funds available from GOU counterpart funding was re-allocated to funding civil works without evidence of approval. Although the OPRC Consultancy Agreement between UNRA and the consultant had the contract price agreed of USD. 9,463,248 and UGX. 2,370,533,211 inclusive of all applicable taxes, withholding tax due from project consultant was erroneously charged to the Project account USD. 187,438 instead of the consultant. 14.

15. Upgrading Masaka – Bukakata Road Project Unqualified Opinion;;; I noted that the financing agreements expired on 30th June 2022 when the funders had not yet disbursed a total of USD.1,047,693.84, which was equivalent to UGX.3,952,948,858. It may therefore be difficult to settle the Project outstanding obligations amounting to UGX.5,046,437,929. The Project cost increased by UGX.340,948,885 in respect of interest paid and interest payable during the year under review alone. This figure was likely to increase in the subsequent year if the outstanding certificates of works worth UGX.4,864,209,954 were not settled at the beginning of the following year. 
