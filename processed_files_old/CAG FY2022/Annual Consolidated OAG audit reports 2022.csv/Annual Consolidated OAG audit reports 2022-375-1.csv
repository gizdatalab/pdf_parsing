8. National Animal Genetic Resources Centre & Data Bank (NAGRIC & DB) Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.1.56Bn, UGX.2.629Bn was realised, representing a performance of 169%. This was attributed to the entity NTR budget projections way below probable revenue sources.
;;;
;;; Out of the budgeted UGX.73.362Bn, UGX.72.762Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX0.6Bn
;;;representing 0.82% of the budget. The Shortfall affected implementation of activities
;;; I reviewed the implementation of a sample of two outputs with a total of four (4) activities worth UGX.7.5Bn. I
;;;"noted that; 1 output with one (1) activity and expenditure worth UGX.2Bn was fully implemented while 1 output"
;;;with 3 activities worth UGX.5.5Bn was partially implemented. As a result, the entity did not finalise establishment
;;;of fish feed plant and animal feed production, processing, packaging and storage facilities on Centre farms.
;;; UGX.0.470Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted for and spent on other activities
;;;without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; I noted challenges in regard to service delivery mainly resulting from delays and non-performing contracts.
;;; I noted shortcomings in the management of land owned by the entity which included encumbrances on 5 pieces
;;;of land, lack of land titles for all 16 entity pieces of land, failure to transfer all the sixteen (16) land titles into the
;;;name and custody of the Uganda Land Commission, unutilized pieces of land.
;;; The entity had outstanding arrears to the tune of UGX.1.31Bn which was an increment of 4.5% from the prior year
;;;arrears balance of UGX.1.25Bn
;;; There was loss of 920 cattle, 521 goats and 1 pig estimated at UGX.0.33Bn through death and theft leading to
;;;loss of government biological assets and thus Government revenues.
;;; I observed that letters of credit opened as far back as 2018/2019 had not performed which continued to affect
;;;progress of works and service delivery.
;;; I noted that the entity management was not adhering to the approved staff structure during recruitment. Some of
;;;the positions were over filled while others were under-filled. In addition, 17 staff had been in acting positions for
;;;more than six months which was irregular.
;;; I noted shortcomings in the management of IT Investments i.e. delays to implement the procured IT system,
;;;failure to dispose IT hardware equipment, inadequate Internal Audit review of the ICT systems that produce
;;;financial statements, lack of an approved IT risk management framework/policy and lack of a business continuity
;;;plan.
;;; Withholding tax to the tune of UGX.0.33Bn from payments worth UGX.6.25Bn was not recovered from service
;;;providers.
