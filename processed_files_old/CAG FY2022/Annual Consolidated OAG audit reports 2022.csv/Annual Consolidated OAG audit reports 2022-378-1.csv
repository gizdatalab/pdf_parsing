13.;"Out of the approved budget of UGX.254.12Bn, UGX.201.35Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.52.66Bn representing a 21% of the budget. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.201.35Bn, only UGX.196.54Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.4.81Bn representing an absorption level of 97.6%. As a result of failure to utilize warrants; Pension and gratuity arrears continued to accumulate, 0.29Mn cashew Nut seedlings were not procured and Staff houses at FTI and BAC were not renovated. I noted that out of the 30 outputs sampled with a total of 83 activities worth UGX.55.7Bn; 18 outputs with 49 activities and expenditure worth UGX.23.1Bn were fully implemented; 10 outputs with 32 activities worth UGX.31.9Bn were partially implemented that is; 20 activities were fully implemented, 11 activities were partially implemented while 1 activity remained unimplemented and 2 outputs with 2 activities worth 0.7Bn were not implemented at all. UGX.1.36Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approval. There was inadequate delivery of services to the citizens as highlighted by delays in construction of infrastructure projects (Dams, valley tanks, irrigation schemes), delayed delivery of vaccines and tractors, delayed distribution of tractors and failure to utilise well drilling rigs. I noted shortcomings in the management of Public Land for instance; failure to record land pieces in the assets register and GFMIS fixed asset module, encumbrances on 27 pieces of land through encroachment, lack of land titles for 59 pieces of land, non-quantification of planned land for acquisition, non-involvement of ULC in land acquisition, failure to transfer 4 land titles into the name and custody of the ULC, unutilised pieces of land, lack of land lease register and Irregular allocation of Land by District Land Boards. The entity had outstanding arrears to the tune of UGX.11.46Bn which was an increment of 4.% from the prior year arrears balance of UGX.11.03Bn.        Ministry of Agriculture, Animal, Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF).
