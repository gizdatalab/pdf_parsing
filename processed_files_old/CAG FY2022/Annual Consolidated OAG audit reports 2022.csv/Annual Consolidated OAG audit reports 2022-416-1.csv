UGX.18,600,672 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The Embassy only paid UGX.3,095,724,757 (12.5%) and not UGX.4,820,729,056 (20%) agreed in signed contract as advance payment to a firm for construction works at Abuja Chancery plot. If this is to continue, this is likely to result into litigation and financial loss. A review of the asset register, Board of Survey report and inspection of HOM residential house revealed that there were 18 unserviceable items that were not disposed as required. I noted that the Embassy’s capital development budget was inadequately funded yet UGX1.35Bn is urgently needed to procure various items to fund urgent operations. E-Visa approval for travelers to Uganda was handled by Immigration office in Kampala without the input of Embassy of Uganda in Nigeria. This poses various risks to Uganda and Nigeria Governments on security issues.     ;;;
