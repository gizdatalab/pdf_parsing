     I noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.2.125Bn during the year under review. Out of this, UGX.0.101Bn was collected, resulting in a shortfall of UGX UGX.2.024Bn which represents 4.75% performance. The entity budgeted to receive UGX.3.59Bn and all of it was warranted. I noted that three (3) outputs with a total of Seventeen (17) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.29Bn were fully quantified, while One (1) output with one (1) activity and expenditure of UGx.0.3BN was not quantified to enable assessment of performance. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX. 740,634,774 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. A review of the approved staff establishment of the Embassy revealed that the Embassy had an approved staff structure of 6 staff positions which were all filled. However, the Embassy had four (4) extra Staff. 4. The Embassy of Republic of Uganda, Cairo 2021 Unqualified Opinion;;;
