;;; I noted delayed service delivery due to the fact that the achievement of Uganda’s EAC commitments is dependent
;;;on the corroboration of the other member states.
;;; I observed that although the trend of domestic arrears over the past three (3) years shows a reduction in arrears,
;;;the Ministry had outstanding arrears totalling to UGX.1.665Bn as at 30th June 2022.
;;; Out of the approved 103 staff positions, 72 positions representing 70% were filled while 31 positions representing
;;;30% were vacant. Further, the Ministry planned to recruit eight (8) staff to fill some of the vacant positions,
;;;however this was not implemented.
"        The Commission budgeted to collect NTR amounting to UGX.0.19Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.0.11Bn was collected, representing a performance of 58% of the target. According to the approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.230.16Bn out of which UGX.227.59Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.2.57Bn. The shortfall represents 1.12% of the approved budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.227.59Bn received during the financial year UGX.161.32Bn was utilized by the entity resulting in un-utilized warrants to the tune UGX.66.27Bn. I assessed the implementation of a sample of six (6) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of sixteen (16) activities worth UGX.79.14Bn and noted that; two (2) outputs were fully implemented, three (3) outputs were partially implemented and one (1) output was not implemented at all. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.556,130,140 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I noted that the commission had undertaken activities towards the conduct of women council elections however; the exercise was never completed due to inadequate funding. I noted that payables worth UGX. 2,744,317,391 relate to fines and penalties levied against the commission by Uganda Revenue Authority and these date back to more than five financial years. The Commission delayed to vacate the current location of its offices in order to pave way for the construction of the Kampala express way. I noted short comings in the management of the ICT function at the commission such as failure to obtain NITA U approvals of the Commission’s system, failure to dispose of obsolete ICT items and absence of structures to steer ICT within the Commission. 75.
