;;;technology development fund, but the basis for arriving at this figure could not be supported. The lack of these

    Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.58.41Bn, only UGX.53.75Bn was spent by the entity resulting into unutilized funds of UGX.4.655Bn representing an absorption level of 92.02%. I noted that of the 19 outputs that I sampled, 12 outputs with 14 activities were fully implemented, 15 quantified activities of the 5 outputs were not implemented. 2 outputs could not be assessed due to lack of performance targets and indicators. Failure to fully implement all planned outputs negatively impacts service delivery. The Project remained with outstanding payables totalling to UGX.5.08Bn by the end of year, which were as a result of completion works for the last mile project whose payments were not made to the contractors. World Bank/IDA cautioned and notified NITAU and MoFPED that it would not pay or take on any project liabilities after 31st December 2022. This implies that Government may have to bear the burden of paying the respective suppliers. A total of USD.249,500 was spent without obtaining a no objection from the World Bank in accordance with the funding guidelines. This caused the PS/ST to instruct the Accounting Officer of NITAU to refund the money to abate the risk of affecting funding of other ongoing World Bank Projects. The Project failed to upgrade the service desk due to the limited time to procure and implement the works before project closure in December 2022. Consequently, a total of USD.664,160.64 was reallocated from the IT service desk budget to upgrade the Data centre. 57.

58. National Authority – Uganda (NITA-U) Information Technology Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.30.24Bn, only UGX.28.678Bn was spent by the entity resulting in unutilized funds of UGX.1.559Bn representing an absorption level of 94.84%. As a result, I noted that some of the planned activities for the year were not implemented, which negatively impacts on service delivery.
;;;
;;; The Authority accumulated receivables and payables to a tune of UGX.28.5Bn and UGX.21.85Bn respectively. The
;;;accumulation of receivables was a result of non-consolidation of MDA and LG IT budgets with NITA-U while the
;;;payables was a result of the budget cuts on the IT consolidated Budget of MDAs and LGs.
;;; The Authority did not have a fully constituted Board which may lead to NITA failing to have effective oversight
;;;functions appropriately undertaken.
;;; I noted a delay in reduction of the cost of internet to USD.20 per MBPS in order to promote connectivity in provision
;;;of Government services in the country. Failure to reduce the internet cost will deny service delivery such as
;;;affordable communication and electronic learning in both public and private institutions country wide.
;;; The Authority was registering professionals and the training institutions without a prescribed standards or
;;;regulations. Over 62 applicants for individual Service Provider and IT institutions applications were received since
;;;2017, 13 of the applicants were certified and only 2 Individual Service Providers have updated certificates while
;;;the 11 are expired.
