;;; The Uganda Land Commission was not notified about the acquisition of one piece of land measuring 0.4 hectares
;;;costing UGX.750,000,000 to enable recording and updating of the GOU land register.
;;; I noted that all the 6 pieces of land measuring approximately 2.12 hectares held by the entity at the reporting date
;;;had not been transferred into the custody of ULC.
;;; I noted that one piece of land measuring approximately 0.4 hectares (100%) had not yet been used in accordance
;;;with the approved purpose set out in the strategic plan.
;;; There was no IT risk management framework/policy at UNEB by the time of the audit.
        I noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.7.7Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.2.3Bn was realised, representing a performance of 30% of the target. I noted that out of the total available funds of UGX. 35.2Bn during the financial year, UGX. 32.65Bn was spent resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 2.55Bn representing absorption level of 92.8%. I noted that four (4) outputs with seven (7) activities and expenditures worth UGX.16.3Bn were fully implemented three (3) outputs with nine (9) activities worth UGX.16.4Bn were partially implemented. I noted that the Board did not have a land title for its 1 piece of land measuring approximately 0.404 hectares (100%) I noted that UBTEB had only made payments amounting to UGX. 3,792,402,179 against the required amount of UGX. 5,126,257,884 toward advance payments for the construction of the proposed UBTEB assessment Centre hence an underpayment of UGX.1,333,855,405. I further noted that at the time of the audit in October 2022, the Board had not made any payments toward the four Interim payment certificates raised by the contractor totaling UGX. 2,980,505,141 I noted that there was no Business and Technical Vocational Qualifications Framework in place rendering it difficult for the Board to effectively execute its mandate. I noted that though the Board had 205 approved staff positions, only 97 had been filled leaving a staffing gap of 108 (52%). I noted that Uganda Hotel Training and Tourism Institute, Bukalasa Agricultural College, and Nyabyeya Forestry College do offer diploma programmes but assess their students contrary to the provision of the law. 41.
