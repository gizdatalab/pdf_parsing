"Out of the NTR estimate of UGX.6Bn, the Institute realized UGX.6.485Bn representing a performance of 108% of the target hence the need for the Institute to review its revenue targets. Out of the total warrants for the financial year of UGX.29.216Bn, only UGX.28.873Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.343Bn (representing an absorption level of 98.8%). As a result, I noted that of the 37 quantified activities worth UGX.14.365Bn assessed; 18 activities (49%) were fully implemented, 18 activities (49%) were partially implemented while 1(one) activity remained unimplemented. I observed that land measuring 4.0470 hectares owned by the entity in Naguru had been encroached upon. Encumbrances hinder management’s ability to utilize the land and pose a risk of loss of land. UGX.2,429,618,348 was assessed by URA as outstanding tax obligation (PAYE) arising from wrong deduction of taxes from professional allowances at 6% instead of 30% as per sec 19 (1) a of the Income Tax Act. Management has started implementing the tax rates but it has resulted into low morale with some professional employees leaving the Institute which may in the long run affect its ability to effectively deliver on its mandate. I noted that UHI has a Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) for patient management and other ancillary services in the OPD, Theatre, Cath Lab, IPD, Lab and other ancillary services. Despite the fact that the system is meant to share information to aid the smooth running of the entity, the system operates in isolation of other systems such as IFMIS and Human Capital Management (HCM) system of Ministry of Public Service. This leads to duplications and inefficiencies I observed that there were no factory trainings conducted for users and engineers (technicians) for some of the equipment procured by the Institute which makes the equipment susceptible to breakdown and prolonged down time. I noted that some vital medical equipment was inadequate according to the bio-medical department analysis and recommendation, while others were due for replacement. This compromises the level of service to patients Out of the 10 (ten) items selected as tracer Essential Medicines at the Institute, three (3) experienced stock-outs ranging from 40 to 45 days. In addition, the Institute had some expired medicine which had no designated holding area; and were kept together with medicines still under use. This poses a high risk to the patients.         40. Uganda Heart Institute. Unqualified Opinion";;;
