 I noted that the Corporation does not have an approved outsourcing policy/framework for received work orders.;;;
4. Markets Agricultural Improvement Project (MATIP) and Trade Unqualified Opinion;;;  There was a shortfall in GoU funding amounting to UGX.0.81Bn representing 81% of the budget. Similarly, the programme had a shortfall in releases from external financing amounting to UGX.32.10Bn representing 45% of the approved budget. The programme failed to absorb UGX.0.27Bn, representing an absorption level of 99%. As a result, I noted that out of the three (3) outputs with nineteen (19) activities worth UGX.37Bn planned for execution, one (1) activity was fully implemented, seven (7) activities were partially implemented, while eleven (11) activities remained

;;; I noted that the programme experienced several challenges in implementing several activities, such as delays in

;;;delivery of services to the citizens.
"      I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.0.14Bn during the year under review; however, UGX.0.37Bn was collected, representing a performance of 264% of the target. According to the approved budget, the entity was supposed to receive UGX.34.4Bn, out of which UGX.33.3Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.1.1Bn. The shortfall represents 3.2% of the approved budget. Out of the total warrants of UGX.33.3Bn received during the financial year, the entity submitted invoices totalling to UGX.31.045Bn resulting in un-utilised warrants of UGX. 2.259Bn representing an absorption level of 93.2%. I assessed the implementation of a sample of twenty-two (22) outputs that had been fully quantified with a total of one hundred forty-six (146) activities worth UGX.23.63Bn and noted that; three (3) outputs with twelve (12) activities and expenditure worth UGX.10.02Bn were fully implemented. Nineteen (19) outputs with one hundred thirty-four (134) activities worth UGX.13.6Bn were partially implemented. Out of the one hundred thirty-four (134) activities, the entity fully implemented fifty-five (55) activities; fifty-five (55) activities were partially implemented, while twenty- four (24) activities remained unimplemented. I undertook physical inspections to establish if works/services were delivered. I noted performance gaps and delays in the renovation of Ministry premises; operationalisation of new cities; operations of the civil service college; compliance with service delivery standards; harmonisation of salaries in Government and roll out and implementation of the Human Capital Management System (HCM). I noted that though the second phase of implementation of the pay policy was scheduled for FYR 2019/20, the MoPS failed to secure a budget allocation with MoFPED for financing pay enhancement. Also, there was no uniform percentage enhancement of the Public officers to benefit from salary enhancement. Additionally, selective enhancement of salaries for cadres like science teachers executing the same job as artisan teachers in public service has further demotivated the workforce. 5.
