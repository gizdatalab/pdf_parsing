Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) entered into a number of contracts worth UGX.2.7Bn with various suppliers without conducting market price assessments. This was contrary to the procurement law and exposed the entity to a risk of obtaining services at uncompetitive prices. Out of the 70 established posts in the UDC structure, only 49 are filled (70% staffing level) and 21 positions were vacant representing 30%. I further noted that among the vacant positions were significant/priority positions such as the Director of Internal Audit, Manager Investment (mining and manufacturing), and Manager Investments Appraisal among others. Inadequate staffing levels affect the level and quality of service delivery by the Corporation and may compromise the principle of segregation of duties.  ;;;

I noted that the bank reconciliations from June 2021 to September 2021 were not correctly done. There were un-reconciling differences between the cashbook and the bank statement balances. In addition to this, the bank reconciliations provided for my review lacked evidence of review and approval by senior management. I noted that the project field staff allowances were not charged PAYE tax. Non-compliance with Income Tax Act may precipitate tax penalties from Uganda Revenue Authority, leading to financial loss for the project. I noted quarterly reports were not submitted to CDC on time. Late submission of reports may delay reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the project by the development partners.    Parliamentary Pension Scheme. Unqualified 1. Opinion;;;
