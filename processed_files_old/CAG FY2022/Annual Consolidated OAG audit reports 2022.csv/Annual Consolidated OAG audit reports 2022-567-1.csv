contribution. Therefore, a budget shortfall of USD.135,657.97 (representing 1.7% of the external funding approved budget) was registered. This has a negative effect on the timely delivery of the planned outputs achievement of project objectives.  Whereas the contract for the supply of medical and Hospital furniture worth USD 1,999,854.56 was initiated in the FY 2018/2019, deliveries had not yet been made by close of the year under review (30th June 2021). In addition, the performance guarantee had expired. Under the circumstances, the intended service delivery is compromised. In addition, the expiry of the bank guarantee exposes the Ministry of Health to a risk of a financial loss in the event that the company fails to deliver.    Three (3) Supplies contracts worth USD 2,582,573.121 for the supply of laboratory equipment had not performed by 30th June 2021 as planned thereby delaying the intended service delivery at both Kayunga and Yumbe hospitals. Failure to ensure timely execution of the project supplies contracts impacts negatively on the achievement of the primary objective of the project of contributing to the delivery of the Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package (UNMHCP), through improvement of health infrastructure at the two hospitals. During the year under review, the project planned, under component 3, to procure six (6) vehicles (2 Ambulances, 2 mini- buses and 2 pickups) for the two hospitals. Draft contracts were prepared and submitted to the Funds for final approval. However, approval of Draft contracts by the Development funders was yet to be obtained and accordingly clearance from the Solicitor General had not been sought by 30th June 2021. Under the circumstances, the intended project outputs were not attained thereby delaying planned service delivery at the two (2) hospitals. There were delays by the Funding Agencies in effecting payments due to Contractors and Suppliers for services offered to the project. This led to failure to pay project obligations on time resulting into accrued outstanding obligations of USD 2,361,491.08 of which USD 1,558,909.95 was related to unpaid interim certificates for civil works, USD765,581.13 due to equipment suppliers and USD 3,700 in respect of unpaid Project staff salaries. Low disbursement rate exposes the project to a risk of loss of funds due to unfavourable foreign exchange fluctuations. Furthermore, the project is at risk of having incomplete project components and litigations due to unpaid obligations at project closure.;;;

  I noted that a material uncertainty existed regarding the continued operation of Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council in the foreseeable future. This state of affairs is supported with a letter from the Permanent Secretary – Ministry of Public Service to all Accounting Officers Ref: MSD/135/165/01 dated 19th April 2021 in which guidance was provided on the modalities for management of public Institutions during the implementation of recommendations on the rationalization of Agencies and Public Expenditure. I noted that during the year under review, management made the necessary adjustments to the opening reserves and receivables (1st July 2020) to recognize the unaccounted for advances of UGX 1,274,315,720 which formed a basis for qualification of opinion on the Council’s financial statements for the Financial Year ending 30th June 2020. 26.
