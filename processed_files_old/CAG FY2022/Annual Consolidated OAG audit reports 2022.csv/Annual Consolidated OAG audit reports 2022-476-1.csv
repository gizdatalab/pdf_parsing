;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.74.5Bn, only UGX.72Bn was spent by the entity resulting in
;;;an unspent balance of UGX.2.5Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. As a result, some planned activities
;;;were not implemented.
;;; The entity has outstanding payables of UGX.320.471Bn in the statement of financial position of which
;;;UGX.320.033Bn is an unpaid pension for former UPTC and UTL staff. Unpaid pension not only exposes government
;;;to risks of costly litigation but also denies the pensioners their right to live a decent life.
;;; The Ministry-approved establishment has 103 positions of which 63 positions are filled (61.2%) leaving a staffing
;;;gap of 40 positions (38.8%). Understaffing negatively affects the overall service delivery.
;;;" I reviewed ICT investment initiatives and noted;"
;;;o There were no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.
;;;o The entity has 7 (53.8%) out of 13 positions of ICT staff establishment. All have the required
;;;qualifications.
;;;o There was no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register.
;;;o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy
;;;2014.
;;; One system, the Academic Information Management System (AIMS), costing UGX.3.0Bn was developed using
;;;Innovators and adopted by Government, however, the source codes were yet to be handed over to evidence
;;;Government Ownership.
;;; The Ministry budgeted for UGX.12.4Bn for PDM activities, out of which, UGX.9.4Bn was released resulting in a
;;;budget shortfall of UGX.3Bn (25%). As a result, planned PDM activities were not fully implemented.
    I noted that the Actuary/ Asset Consultant did not conduct an actuarial valuation of the scheme for the year under review, and the existing one was done in 2019. There were unsupported payables of UGX.3.904 Bn, of which Administrative fees of UGX.2.022Bn and Actuarial fees of UGX.442Mn. Under the circumstances, it was difficult to provide assurance that the amounts in question are genuine liabilities to the Scheme. I further noted that the amounts have not changed over the years implying Scheme’s inability to settle its obligations. Disclosed under Note 15 to the Financial Statements on page 22, are receivables recognised by the Scheme amounting to UGX.4.171Bn, up from UGX.4.038Bn the previous year, arising from amounts due from employers (UTL In-Administration). However, these receivables were not supported with any documentation and schedule to confirm the amounts and authenticity, which renders the receivables doubtful. I further noted that as reported in the previous year, according to UTL in-administration, only UGX.2.466Bn was due to UCECPS, implying a variance of UGX.1.705Bn. 51.
