"Out of the Donor budget of UGX.39.29Bn, only UGX.21.15Bn was availed for spending resulting in a shortfall of UGX.18.14Bn representing 46%. Further, of the UGX.4.897Bn GOU co-funding, only UGX.4.647Bn was warranted resulting in a shortfall of UGX.0.25Bn representing 5.1%. Out of the total available funds for the year of UGX.26.659Bn, only UGX.15.366Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.11.293Bn representing an absorption level of 58.5%. As a result of under-absorption, a number of planned activities were not implemented by the project which affected service delivery. Out of the sampled 88 activities worth UGX.9.67Bn assessed; 15 activities representing 17% were fully implemented, 22 activities representing 25% were partially implemented, while 51 activities representing 58% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement activities affects service delivery. I noted inadequacies in service delivery in form of delayed review of consultancy reports to enable approval of new hubs for oil palm growing by IFAD and delayed hand over of Land for the nucleus estates for oil palm development due to delays in transferring of titles for the acquired land. I noted non-remittance of loan recoveries to the UCF worth UGX.18.4Bn thus delaying implementation of critical government programs. Further, there was non-utilization of reflows to a tune of UGX.29.1bn to fund the National Oil Palm Project (NOPP) in contravention of the tripartite agreement thus denying the citizens benefits accruing.      9.
