"    I noted that with the demand for wages outpacing the current growth rate of the economy, there is a risk that Government would fall short of: Servicing the financial implication of the increased pension liability as a result of salary enhancement since pension liability is calculated upon the final salary at retirement; Delivering quality services in the different sectors to the citizens as a substantial portion of the resources available would be reallocated to servicing the wage requirement. I noted that the expiry of the five years approved pay targets and principles would elapse in the FYR ended 2022/23. Yet, with the recently concluded budget cycle, no funds were appropriated to enhance the salaries of technical officers in the Public Service in both Central and Local Governments.";;;

"    I observed that the program work plans and budgets were never approved by Parliament, contrary to the PFMA. The programme received all the anticipated funds from the donors; however, GoU counterpart funding was less than expected by USD 0.02 Million. The program absorbed USD USD.1,141,876, which is 53% of the funds availed to the project for implementation of activities. I noted that the project substantially quantified all its activities. Out of the sixty-eight (68) activities assessed, forty-four (44) – 65% of activities worth USD 975,602 were fully implemented, fourteen (14)- 21% of activities worth USD 116,816 were partially implemented, while ten (10)- 15% of activities worth USD 49,457 were not implemented at all. 7.
