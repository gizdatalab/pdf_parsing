    A review of the project financial records revealed that, as of 30th June 2021, although cumulative receipts of EUROs 4,200,000 (100%) had been released to the project by the Italian Republic, the cumulative expenditure was EUROs 3,355,254.49 (79.89%) thereby leaving EUROs 844,495.51(20%) unabsorbed by close of the year under review. I further noted that the remaining project funds are insufficient to complete the project due to cost escalations. Under the circumstances, the project is exposed to a risk of incomplete projects and unpaid obligations at project closure. The Italian Government delayed to disburse the second installment which affected the execution of the civil works under the initial contract. The Ministry of Health provided USD 1,304,322.96 (earlier meant for the procurement of x-rays) to the project to keep the works going. Upon receipt of the 2nd release from the Italian Government in December 2017, USD 1,276,847 was refunded leaving a balance of EUROs 22,302.24 outstanding to date. I informed management that delayed refund of internally borrowed monies negatively affects the delivery of the Ministry’s planned outputs. The Ministry of Health engaged a foreign firm to construct 68 staff houses at selected Health Centre IIIs in 9 Karamoja Districts at USD 5,592,885. The contract period was 18 months and a sum of USD 1,118,577 was advanced to the contractor on 16th June 2016. However, due to delayed payments by the Ministry arising from delayed release of funds by both the Italian Government and GoU co-funding, works stalled in 2018 and eventually the contractor abandoned the sites. I noted that at the time when the sites were abandoned, USD 415,025.48 had been recovered by the Ministry against the advance leaving a balance of USD 703,551.56. On the other hand, works valued at USD 315,827.87 had been certified. The contractor sued the Ministry for breach of contract. Whereas a reconciliation statement was prepared by the project consultant and shared with the contractor, the latter insisted that the Ministry settles the outstanding amount of USD 315,827.87. This court case had not been disposed by the time of audit.  Whereas the contracts for civil works under Lot 1 and Lot 2 were scheduled to be completed on 16th May 2021, the sites had not been handed over and commissioned by 30th June 2021. Delayed contract execution compromises the timely achievement of project objectives and may lead to cost escalations.

The Italian Support to the Uganda Health Sector Strategic Plan Iii (HSSPIII) and the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) For Northern Uganda Karamoja Housing Project (KRSP) Region Staff Unqualified 23. Opinion;;; Out of the total actual receipts of EUR 4,199,750 a sum of EUR 3,691,785.65(88%) had been utilised by 30th June 2022 implying an under absorption of 12% of the total project grant. At the end of the financial year, the project closed with a cash and cash equivalent of EUR 530,266.59.  Whereas the contracts for Lot 1 and Lot 2 were meant to be completed on 16th May 2021, only Lot 1 sites had been handed over and commissioned by end of FY 2021/2022. This implies delays for Lot 2 of 17 months from the planned completion date of 16th May 2021. By December 2022, the sites had not been completed.

 I noted that out of the expected receipts of USD.8,643,589.75, the project received funding totalling USD.8,579,596.82 constituting USD.7,769,470.24 from external sources and USD.810,126.58 (UGX. 2,880,000,000) from GoU counterpart Kayunga Yumbe Hospital Project (KAYUP) FYT June 2021 24.;;;
