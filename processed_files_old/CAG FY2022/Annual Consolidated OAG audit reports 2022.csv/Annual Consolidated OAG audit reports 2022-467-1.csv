 Failure to constitute the SACCO Stabilisation Fund and the SACCO Savings Protection Fund contrary to the law.;;;
29. Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) Unqualified Opinion;;; I noted that the MoFPED had an approved budget of UGX.815.5Bn out of which UGX.792.8Bn was warranted,
;;;
;;;resulting in a shortfall of UGX.22.7Bn, which represents 2.8% of the approved budget. Budget shortfalls constrain management is implementing fully, the approved activities and hence service delivery.
;;;
;;; Out of the total warrants of UGX.792.8Bn received during the financial year, UGX.782.4Bn was utilised by the
;;;Ministry resulting in unutilized warrants of UGX.10.34Bn representing absorption level of 98.7%. As a result, I
;;;noted that of the 64 outputs that I sampled, Eighteen (18) outputs were fully implemented, thirty-six (36) outputs
;;;were partially implemented, Seven (7) out puts were not implemented, while Three (3) out puts could not be
;;;assessed. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery.
;;; The Ministry did not have a running strategic plan to facilitate achievement of the NDP III objectives. This poses
;;;a risk of non-attainment of NDP III objectives since the strategic plan that would serve as basis for the annual
;;;plan and budget that is being implemented is non-existent.
;;; Domestic arrears stock was reported as UGX.473Bn as at the end of the financial year 2021/22 up from
;;;UGX.268.9Bn in F/Y 2020/21 representing 76% increase. The Domestic arrears are not given appropriate budget
;;;provision hence accumulation of the stock. Failure to budget and pay arrears negatively impacts the
;;;creditworthiness of the Ministry and could result into penalties and costly litigations.
;;; The Ministry did not disclose contingent liabilities worth UGX2.839Bn in the memorandum statement of Contingent
;;;liabilities. This denies end users of the Financial Statements useful information for decision making.
;;; The Ministry has seven (7) IT systems which were not integrated or not automatically sharing information with
;;;other systems. This could lead to duplication of functionalities, procurement of non-compatible solutions and
;;;equipment, and general deviation from Government’s efforts to rationalize resources for better service delivery.
" The approved budget for the previous financial year (FY2020/21) was UGX.45.49Trillion, which would have translated into UGX.227.47Bn funding for the Contingencies Fund in the year under review, in accordance with the formula provided in the PFMA, 2015. I however noted the following; Unqualified 30. Contingencies Fund Opinion";;;
