;;; Although the Hospital has an official bed capacity of 550, I noted that the bed occupancy rate was 150% and that the Hospital
;;;was handling over 1,000 in-patients on a daily basis.
;;; The entity has two Information technology systems, that is, the internally developed Medical Records Management System
;;;(MRMS) and the Health Management Information System (HMIS) which were not integrated and therefore not automatically
;;;sharing information with each other which leads to duplications and inefficiencies and affects service delivery.
;;; 143 IT equipment which had exceeded the recommended 3 year useful life and recommended for decommissioning by the
;;;Board of Survey were not disposed of.

        Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.13.168Bn, the Hospital spent UGX.13.030Bn resulting in unspent balance of UGX.0.139Bn representing an absorption level of 99%. The unspent funds were meant for payment of salary and furniture and fittings. 26 quantified activities worth UGX.11.557Bn were assessed and established that 23 activities representing 88% were fully implemented while 3 activities representing 12% were partially implemented. Funds to the tune of UGX.47,111,540 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Out of the payables of UGX.932,927,785, UGX.669,602,626 owed to UMEME Ltd have been outstanding for the last 3 financial years while UGX.263,325,159 owed to BHL Healthcare Ltd has existed for the last 2 financial years. The Hospital did not pay gratuity worth UGX.167,487,795 to three (3) pensioners as by the close of the financial year. Although the hospital had an established staffing level of 889 only 296(33%) positions were filled leading to an understaffing of 585 (67%). Although the Hospital deployed two (2) information systems (Integrated Hospital Management Information System and Open Electronic Medical record system) they did not have any automated interface mechanisms to share information (integrated). This leads to duplication and inefficiency. A review of the ICT governance structure of the entity revealed that there was no specific structure that steers and oversees ICT implementation and approved IT risk management framework/policy. 32. Kawempe National Referral Hospital. Unqualified The Hospital contracted M/S Toyota Uganda Limited (CFAO Motors Uganda) to supply two double cabin Pickups at a contract sum of UGX.433,432,126. I however noted that although the entire contract amount was paid only one double cabin pickup had been delivered by the time of reporting, almost 6 months late. Opinion;;;
