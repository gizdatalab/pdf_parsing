 Out of the staff structure of 491 staff only 357 positions were filled, resulting in a staffing gap of 134 (27%) of the staff structure. I noted that UETCL o the Rural Electrification Fund evacuates power over weak third-party grids, The entity relies on 33KV infrastructure of UEDCL, REA and UMEME as wheelers, to evacuate power. The lines are faced with various faults and outages making it unreliable. I further noted that there were no formal wheeling agreements imposing duties and obligations for the third-party wheelers. I noted non-remittance of the 5% Rural Electrification Levy by UETCL, amounting to UGX.131,958,754,535, contray to the electricity (establishment and management of Rural electrification fund) instrument No. 75 of 2001 and instrument number 29 of 2021.  I noted termination of the contract for the construction of houses for Project Affected Persons, due to submission of false extensions of advance payment guarantee by contractors amounting to UGX. 256,455,705 and performance bond guarantee amounting to UGX. 128,227,852. The progress of execution of work by the new contractor under LOT A (Uganda- Kenya Overhead transmission line) was at only 30%, 60% of the works were affected by court injunctions and 10% by failure to procure materials to cover the vandalized sections.
