 international organisations, the Ministry was not able to fully settle the opening domestic arrears due to insufficient budgetary provisions. This exposes government to a risk of litigation and possible unnecessary litigation costs. A total of UGX.27.9Bn was paid to 13 Cooperative Societies, yet these were not in the original Ministry’s work plan. This creates unfairness and lack of transparency in the settlement of the outstanding compensation funds.  War claims compensation of UGX.29.09Bn was made to third parties but not directly to the beneficiary Cooperative societies for onward remittance to beneficiary Cooperative members. I found the practice of payment through third parties both inconveniencing and exposing government to a risk of loss of public funds to non-bonafide members, given the lack of participation of members of the cooperative societies.;;;
9. Uganda National Bureau of Standards. Unqualified Opinion;;; The entity budgeted to receive UGX.65.04Bn out of which UGX.64.08Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.96Bn, representing 1.4% of the approved budget. Under release of funds undermines service delivery
;;; since not all the planned outputs could be produced, given the available funds. The Digital Conformity Stamps had not yet been implemented by the entity despite the service provider’s readiness.
;;;As a result, UGX.19.88 Bn was not remitted by the service provider to UNBS since it is dependent on UNBS’s implementation of Digital Conformity Stamps.
;;;
;;; The Bureau had a staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. There is a risk that sub-standard
;;;goods are entering the Ugandan market through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present.
;;; The entity had accrued pension and gratuity of UGX.1.29Bn contrary to regulations. Non-payment of pension leads
;;;to the accumulation of arrears and affects the livelihood of the pensioners.
;;; There was no particular budget line for destroying substandard commodities that come into the country and those
;;;seized from market surveillance activities. As a result, warehouses in the Bureau were filled with substandard
;;;products that were not yet destroyed.
;;; Procurements amounting to UGX.1.32Bn that were initiated during the financial year had not been completed by
;;;the close of the financial year. This leads to delays in service delivery.
"  Out of the UGX.243.62Bn total funds available for spending, only UGX.33.14 (13%) was spent by the Corporation leaving a balance of UGX.210.48Bn representing 87% under absorption. The low absorption was attributed to the supplementary funding that was approved during the financial year and only availed towards year-end. Delayed receipt and utilization resulted into delays in service delivery. I noted that there is slow progress on the takeover of Government interests as listed in Schedule 2 of the UDC Act 2016, which identified seven Government undertakings that were to be taken over. I noted that only two companies (i.e. Phoenix Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Ltd) had been transferred to UDC. The remaining five, namely; Amber House Limited, Embassy House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort and Nile Hotel International Limited were still outstanding. Delays undermine the implementation of the UDC Act 2016 and undermine the public policy of streamlining the management of these corporations 10. Uganda (UDC).
