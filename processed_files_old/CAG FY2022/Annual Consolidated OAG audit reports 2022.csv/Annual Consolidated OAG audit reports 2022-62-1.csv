SN Observation Recommendation;;;
retirement date. In case of death or early retirement, the process should be initiated immediately the Letters of Administration are issued and/or the early retirement has been granted. 5.1.2 of establishment notice no. 3 of 2019 provides that pensioners’ retirement benefits are authorised 5 days after retirement for payment. I however noted that 1,019 new pensioners/beneficiaries in 65 LGs delayed to access pension payroll, with some delays ranging from 50 to 110 months. As a result, UGX.1,380,739,357 was not paid. Details are in Appendix 1 i. Failure to access pension payroll affects pensioners’ livelihood and also leads to accumulation of pension arrears. While non- removal of transferred staff affects the releasing LGs as replacements cannot access the payroll until the transferred staff have been discontinued. The Accounting Officers attributed this to challenges with setting-up pensioners in the IPPS by MoPS because the process is not fully decentralised for which the LGs have no control. Most Accounting Officers had hopes that the introduction of HCM will most likely address the issue. interaction with MoPS indicated that this is still a challenge and as a stop gap measure, the Accounting Officers are advised to bring cases of un-validated staff to the attention of MoPS for follow up with NIRA. Going forward, with the introduction of HCM, data of only validated staff will be migrated. Paragraph My;;;
