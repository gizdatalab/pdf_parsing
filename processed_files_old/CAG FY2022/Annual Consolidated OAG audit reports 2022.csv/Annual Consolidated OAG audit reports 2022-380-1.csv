;;; A review of four (4) sampled quantified outputs with a total of forty-three (43) activities worth UGX. 52.8Bn
;;;revealed that all the four (04) outputs were partially implemented.
;;; Funds amounting to UGX 0.183Bn was irregularly diverted from the activities on which it was budgeted for and
;;;spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.
;;; The Authority received off-budget financing worth UGX.3.3Bn which was never declared to the PS/ST.
;;; Field inspections and document review revealed several short comings in service delivery such as delayed
;;;installation of wet mills, failure to establish demonstration gardens despite spending funds among others.
;;; The entity had unsettled domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 amounting to UGX 15.9Bn.
;;; Out of the approved staff structure of 224 staff, only 138 (61%) positions were filled leaving 86 (39%) positions
;;;vacant. Among the vacant posts are key positions of managers.

JUSTICE, LAW AND ORDER SECTOR;;;
1. The Industrial Court of Uganda Unqualified Opinion;;; The Court did not have a strategic plan to facilitate preparation of annual work plans and the achievement of the NDP objectives.
;;;
;;;  I noted that all the three (03) quantified activities assessed worth UGX.2.095Bn were partially implemented. A review of the financial statements revealed that the Court reported under the statement of financial position payables amounting to UGX. 247,000,000. These related to unpaid sundry creditors in the period under review.
;;;
;;;
;;; There are conflicting provisions between the Employment Act, 2006 and the Labour Disputes (Arbitration and
;;;Settlement) Act, 2006 on period taken by labour officers to handle labour disputes, the qualifications of both the
;;;Labour officers and the Court panellists and their role as quasi-judicial officers were not standardised.
;;; I also noted delayed implementation of the Court structure resulting into increased case backlogs from 2,524 to
;;;2,722 cases (8%) as at 30th June 2022.
"  Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.25.83Bn, only UGX.19.31Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.6.52Bn representing an absorption level of 75%. As a result, I noted that out of the ten (10) quantified outputs worth UGX.12.51Bn assessed; three (3) outputs were fully implemented, while seven (7) outputs were partially implemented. I assessed the delivery of services from implemented activities and noted that whereas DGAL acquired a Laboratory Information Management System in the financial year 2020/2021 at a cost of €58,146.60 (equivalent to UGX.250,000,000), the system was not fully utilised. 2.
