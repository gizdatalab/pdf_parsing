;;;; The company had trade and other receivables of UGX 32.8 billion as at 30th June 2022 compared to UGX 32.4
;;;;billion of the previous period (2021) and expected credit losses of UGX 3.37 billion (2021: UGX 3.2 billion) as at
;;;;30th June 2022. Management performed the impairment assessment of trade receivables and other receivables
;;;;using its own expected credit loss model. I however noted challenges with the expected credit loss model, like a
;;;;lack of integration of the risk management framework into the financial reporting system, the different users of
;;;;the model, were not trained on how to use the model and there were inconsistencies in the source of data for the
;;;;model.
3.;        The Statement of Financial Position as at 30th June, 2022 reported the UPPC Investment in the Joint Venture (Uganda Security Printing Company Limited) at a cost of UGX.9.097Bn as valued by 30th June, 2020 but did not use the equity method as required by IFRS 11- Joint arrangements implying that the statement is misstated and misleading to the users. I noted that whereas the Tax records as per URA revealed a tax liability figure of UGX.1.609Bn, the Financial Statements disclosed only UGX.1.148Bn resulting in a variance of UGX.0.461Bn I noted that debtors worth UGX.3.76Bn have been outstanding for a period ranging between 361 days to 1800 days contrary to best practice thus limiting the availability of funds for UPPC activities. Review of the Corporation financial performance revealed a fall in profits of 64.4% from profits of UGX.3.38Bn realized in the previous year, a reduction of 21% on Return on Assets from 26% posted in the previous year, a liquidity ratio of 2.8 implying the Corporation is not efficiently using its current assets and failure to pay any dividend to government for the previous (3) years despite making profits. I noted that the Corporation did not have a functional Board of directors during the year under review since the tenure for the previous Board had elapsed in October 2021. Out of the approved staff establishment of 120 staff, only 69 were filled representing 57.5% thereby leaving a staffing gap of 51. I noted shortcomings in regard to procurement and utilization of IT equipment i.e. IT systems/equipment procured without clearance by NITA-U and neither recorded in the Assets register, failure to accurately record (35) IT assets worth UGX.0.256Bn in the right format, failure to allocate and engrave 25 IT assets to staff in the assets register, lack of specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation, non-representation of ICT in top management, lack of an approved IT staff structure, failure by internal Audit to review the various ICT systems and lack of rights to some of the systems, unapproved draft ICT policy, lack of a risk register and lack of a business continuity plan. I noted that (01) piece of land measuring 1.778 Hectares was disposed of as a contribution to the joint venture with USPC at UGX.9.091Bn below the Chief Government Valuer valuation of UGX.10.6Bn hence causing a financial loss of UGX.1.509Bn to Government and all the 5 pieces of land measuring approximately 1.256 hectares held by the entity valued at UGX4.151Bn were not fully utilized.
