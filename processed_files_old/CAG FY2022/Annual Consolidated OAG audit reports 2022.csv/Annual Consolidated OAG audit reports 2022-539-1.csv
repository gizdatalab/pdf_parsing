 Whereas Section 1.2 of the Partnership Agreement stated that the Programme Projects would commence on 1st January 2021, I noted that funds disbursements were received late towards the year end for all the Projects under NORHED II Programme. The delays ranged from 4- 11 months, depending on the completion of implementing agreements of the various projects. Late disbursement of funds may have affected the implementation of planned project activities. I noted, out of the NOK 7,753,259 (USD.846,508) budgeted under the Programme, only NOK 5,890,963 (USD.679,048) was received, which is 76% performance. This led to a budget shortfall of NOK 1,862,296 (USD.167,049). I further noted that out of the released funds to the Programme totaling to NOK 5,890,963 (USD.679,048), only NOK 3,146,879 (USD.362,801) was utilized by the Programme projects, indicating a programme funds absorption rate of only 53.4%.   The Norwegian Programme for Capacity Development in Higher Education And Research For Development (Norhed) 2020 Unqualified 55.

I noted that expenditure amounting to UGX.1,074,783 was not supported contrary to the requirements of the Treasury Instructions. I noted that the Ministry recruited GBV support officers as volunteers who earned a basic allowance, however, their contracts indicated that they earned a monthly salary of UGX.500,000, which is above the PAYE threshold and qualifies for PAYE deductions as per the income Tax Act.   1.
