;;; Three (03) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.51 were clearly and fully
;;;quantified to enable assessment of performance.
;;; I noted that three (03) outputs with a total of fourteen (14) activities worth UGX.3.51Bn were partially
;;;"implemented. Out of fourteen (14) activities, six (6) representing 43% of the activities were fully implemented;"
;;;three (3) activities (21%) were partially implemented while five (5) activities (36%) were not implemented.
;;;" The activities that were not fully implemented included; 10 planned scholarships, Presentation of Credentials to"
;;;Cambodia, Laos-PDR and Myanmar, 3 bilateral engagements and 12 planned official delegations.
;;; The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 after the deadline given for submission of the
;;;reports and the level of performance was consistent with my review of other comparative information and reports.
45. Uganda High Commission in London. Unqualified Opinion;;; The Mission continues to experience funding challenges, with several of its planned activities in the strategic plan not adequately funded as planned. Of specific concern is the absence of funding to undertake urgent repairs on the Mission properties (Chancery, Official residence and the Rentable structure on Wardour Street), which continue to increase the eventual repair costs given that they continue to further degenerate with severe weather conditions.
;;;The continued underfunding implies that the Mission will face challenges in implementing all the planned activities
;;;which may in turn impact on the attainment of the intended goals.
;;; The Mission did not budget to collect any Non-Tax Revenue (NTR) during the year under review, although a total
;;;of UGX.769.6Mn was collected. Failure to budget for such NTR implies that there was no target upon which the
;;;Mission’s performance could be evaluated.
;;; The Accounting Officer did not appoint contract managers for the procurements worth GBP.113,788 (equivalent
;;;to UGX.522Mn) during the year under review. Failure to appoint contract managers is irregular and may lead to
;;;challenges in contract implementation going un detected by management, in the absence of close supervision of
;;;the performance of such contracts.
;;; The Mission did not procure a medical insurance provider during the year under review, and mission staff would
;;;obtain treatment from health facilities and claim refunds upon presentation of receipts. This practice is contrary to
;;;the requirements by the public service standing orders.
