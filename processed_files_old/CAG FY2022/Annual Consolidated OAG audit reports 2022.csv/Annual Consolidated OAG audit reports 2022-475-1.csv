Unqualified;;; According to the staff establishment, the approved number of positions for PPDA is 140, out of which only 103
;;;positions were filled, leaving 37 positions vacant, which is 26% of the workforce. Failure to fill the staff
;;;establishment hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Authority.
     Out of the approved budget of UGX.6.894Bn, UGX.6.237Bn was warranted and the entity spent UGX.5.246Bn resulting into un-utilized warrants of UGX.975Bn representing an absorption level of 84.32%. As a result, some of the Authority planned activities remained unimplemented, due to failure to absorb all the availed funding, which in turn, negatively impacts service delivery. The entity paid mandatory (10%) contributions to the National Social Security Fund worth UGX.301.66Mn, and also paid an extra UGX.446.04Mn to a second standard contribution scheme operated by the Authority. This resulted into a double payment of gratuity contributions contrary to the requirements of the Public Service Standing Orders. The responsible Minister had not constituted the Capital Markets Tribunal to handle disputes arising out of disputes in the sector. The entity also lacked some critical regulations necessary for the management of the activities of the Authority. The audit of the licensing function revealed that: The Authority conducted irregular licensing without prescribed fees being paid, the entity failed to follow up licensees with expired licenses, the entity failed to collect security deposit from Brokers dealers licensed, lacked evidence of proper due diligence, and also failed to license primary dealers of Government Bonds. Such weaknesses point to challenges in execution of its mandate which could lead to failure to collect all potential revenues. In the audit of Human Resource management, I noted that the Authority lacked an approved staff and salary structure, contrary to the standing orders. There were also no comprehensive annual performance plans and Job Descriptions for the staff during the year under review. This complicates assessment of staff performance at year end. 48.
