      I noted that in the Statement of Financial Position, the company reported a current account balance of UGX.1.221Bn which was not backed by any schedule and/or supporting documents. I was unable to confirm the correctness of the current account balance reported in the financial statements. A total of UGX.110Mn in outstanding receivables was not supported by any documentation or schedule to enable independent confirmation of the value. I noted that whereas the Company reported net cash flows of UGX.13.77Mn as per statement of cash flows (page 11), this was not reported in the statement of financial position. I observed a reduction in capital reserves of UGX.57.6Mn in the statement of changes in equity, however, the change in the capital reserves was not in line with the reported net loss in the statement of profit or loss of UGX.62.6Mn, thereby occasioning an unexplained variance of UGX.5Mn. The Company did not have any quantified outputs, and as such, no assessment as to the extent of implementation was undertaken. Uganda Seeds Limited did not have an approved strategic plan and budget to guide and support the company's Management undertaking its stewardship roles. 26.
