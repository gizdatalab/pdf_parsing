Arua Regional Referral Hospital private wing did not have an approved work plan and budget for the financial year 2019/2020.The strategic plan and budget is supposed to guide the budgeting process by creating integrated link with the general hospital annual work plans which feed into the budget to ensure effective service delivery and achievement of their vision, mission and objectives. The hospital did not maintain a detailed risk register for all risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. As such, there were no strategies and officers responsible to mitigate the occurrence of such risks or to minimize the impact in the event that these risks materialized. The failure to maintain risk registers implies that the entity does not have a mitigation or response strategy to risks that may affect the achievement of planned activities.
