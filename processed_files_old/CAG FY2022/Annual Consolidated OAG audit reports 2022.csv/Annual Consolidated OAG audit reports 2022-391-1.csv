15. The Uganda Registration Services Bureau –Liquidation. Unqualified Opinion;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.24.83Bn, only UGX.24.51Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.32Bn representing an absorption level of 98.7%. As a result, I noted that all the four (4) quantified outputs worth UGX.20.2Bn were partially implemented.
;;;
;;; I assessed the implementation of URSB’s mandate and noted that the Bureau was experiencing challenges in
;;;storage space on the servers to support the entity’s IT systems, affecting service delivery. Whereas the Bureau
;;;requires a storage size of 69 terabytes, only nine terabytes were available for allocation. It was further revealed
;;;that the available space is approximated to only serve until June 2023, given the current demand for storage
;;;space, after which the Bureau will be out of space.
;;; I reviewed the operations of the National Marriage Registration System and noted several changes affecting service
;;;"delivery. These included; Clients can only make payments through the bank, the filling of civil marriage returns by"
;;;the Chief Administrative Officers is not enabled, the system doesnot provide alerts or real-time updates of an
;;;application for marriage to intending couples, hence making the follow up of any progress difficult. In addition,
;;;the replacement of lost certificates is not catered for in the system, and the system allows filing of marriages from
;;;ungazetted churches.
;;; A trend analysis of the Bureau’s domestic arrears position for the past three years showed that arrears increased
;;;by 335% from UGX.1.47Bn in 2019/2020 to UGX.6.38Bn in 2021/2022. No budgetary provision was made to settle
;;;domestic arrears totalling UGX.4,516,077,833 in the year under audit.
;;; I reviewed the management of IT investments and noted that the entity receives insufficient funds to maintain IT
;;;hardware. In addition, the Bureau has no maintenance plan for IT systems, and routine maintenance of systems
;;;is not carried out. Instead, the Bureau relies on corrective maintenance of IT systems and equipment in response
;;;to user requests or when systems break down.
;;; A review of the Board of survey reports and the assets register revealed that 301 IT equipment had been used for
;;;periods exceeding ten (10) years and are due for disposal.
