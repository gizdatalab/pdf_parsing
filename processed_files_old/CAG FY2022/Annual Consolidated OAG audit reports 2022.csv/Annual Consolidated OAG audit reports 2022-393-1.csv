 I observed that the NGO Bureau did not have a fully constituted and operational board of directors to oversee the operations of the Bureau during the year under review.;;;
19. Uganda Police Force. Unqualified Opinion;;;  UPF budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.24.50Bn but realised a total of UGX.33.01Bn representing a performance of 135% of the target. Out of the total budgeted GoU receipts for the financial year of UGX.980.67Bn, UGX.977.63Bn (99.9%) was collected and fully utilised during the year. I sampled sixteen (16) outputs worth UGX.673.89Bn for assessment and noted that seven (7) outputs worth UGX.168.09Bn were fully implemented, while nine (9) outputs worth 245.97Bn were partially implemented.

;;; A total of UGX.3.05Bn was diverted from activities for which they were budgeted and spent on the settlement of
;;;arrears.
;;;" I assessed the performance of the police Canine unit and noted that; the police dogs are concentrated in the"
;;;Kampala region despite statistics indicating a significant number of crimes reported in rural areas.
;;; I noted that the dogs’ medical requirements are not sufficiently addressed due to an insufficient number of
;;;veterinary staff, insufficient transportation facilities and poor housing for the dogs.
;;; I assessed the performance of the forensics unit and noted that the unit does not have a Laboratory Information
;;;Management System and an automated exhibit tracking system. Analysis shows that there was an increase in the
;;;backlog of cases in the Forensic unit.
;;; I observed overcrowding at the UPF’s enrolment and distribution centre for Certificates of Good Conduct. This was
;;;attributed to the increased demand for the certificates. For instance, the number of certificates issued increased
;;;by 170% from 31,671 in 2020 to 85,664 in 2021. There is need to establish more enrolment centres and
;;;decentralise the operations.
;;; I reviewed the performance of investigation by the CID and noted that only 56% of cases were investigated and
;;;concluded, leaving a backlog of 316,667 cases. This was partly attributed to low levels of automation in the
;;;investigation process, limited technical and financial support, and human resource challenges such as insufficient
;;;training.
;;; I reviewed the performance of the Express Penalty Scheme and noted an increasing trend of unpaid tickets for
;;;fines issued over three (3) years. The analysis revealed that out of the 1.77 million tickets issued in the last three
;;;financial years, 700,000 tickets worth UGX.94Bn were still unpaid at the time of audit. This was attributed to
;;;weaknesses in the enforcement of payment of traffic fines. Some offenders are untraceable, with no permanent
;;;"addresses; others are foreigners, and yet there is no policy on enforcement procedures, especially for such"
;;;defaulters.
