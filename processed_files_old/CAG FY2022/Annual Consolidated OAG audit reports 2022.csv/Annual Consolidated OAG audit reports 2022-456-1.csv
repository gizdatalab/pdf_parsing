   I noted that the Company included a gain on fair valuation of investment property undertaken amounting to UGX.18 billion basing on the valuation undertaken in the financial year ended 30th June 2022. However, there was revaluation of the investment property as required under IAS 40 at the end the accounting period ended 30th June 2021 due to the prevailing COVID 19 lock down during the year. As at close of business 30 June 2021, the Company had unremitted statutory obligations of UGX. 5.9 billion which related to Value Added Tax (UGX. 2.5 billion), Pay as you Earn (UGX. 2.0 billion) and National Social Security Fund (UGX. 1.5 billion).
