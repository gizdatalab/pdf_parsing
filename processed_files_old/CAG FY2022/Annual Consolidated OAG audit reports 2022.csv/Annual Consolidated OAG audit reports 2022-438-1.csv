;;; The Mission budgeted to receive UGX.6.04Bn which was all warranted representing 100% performance on GoU
;;;receipts.
;;; Out of the total receipts of UGX.6.04Bn, UGX.5.86Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of

"    The Mission delayed to remit cash balances to the Consolidated Fund. I noted that the Mission had total collections including unspent balances in the current year and balance brought forward from previous year totalling to UGX.1.679Bn. At the closur 1 e of the period, UGX.1.348Bn had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.0.331Bn. The practice amounts to a violation of regulations and could lead to misallocation of the Embassy’s funds. I noted that the Assets Register maintained by the Mission was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions, and several asset details were missing. I also noted a number of unserviceable items recommended for disposal in the prior financial year but still remained undisposed at the end of 2020/2021. The Mission owns two chancery buildings in Washington DC. The Board of Survey and an engineering assessment on the buildings disclosed the following among other issues; o The back porch of one of the buildings continued to disintegrate due to an unstable foundation. o The Chancery buildings on plots 5909 and 5911 had shown serious structural cracks ranging from 1mm to 7mm. The landing rear porch of building on plot 5909 had completely failed. o The buildings were susceptible to storm water, which was disastrous to their integrity given that the interior of the buildings was made of wood. The incomplete splash aprons were noted to be allowing water in the buildings. My inspection of the buildings revealed structural issues including corrosion of water pipes, cracks in the buildings, detached chimney on building on 5911 and detached porch on building on plot 5909. The buildings are likely to deteriorate further if no urgent civil works are undertaken, which renders their occupancy by Mission staff and their clients unsafe. Delayed works may also render the repairs more costly. 67. Uganda Embassy in Washington Unqualified Opinion";;;
