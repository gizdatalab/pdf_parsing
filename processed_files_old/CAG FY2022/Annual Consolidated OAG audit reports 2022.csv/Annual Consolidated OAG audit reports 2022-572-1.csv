;;; Two (2) regional office buildings of UBTS in Mbale and Fort portal were constructed within the regional hospitals land without
;;;land titles or signed memoranda of understanding. In the circumstances, UBTS could lose infrastructural investments in case
;;;of future disagreements.
;;; Plot 2F on Nakasero Hill Road which houses the Headquarters of UBTS was encroached upon by a Hotel by way of a wall fence
;;;covering a total area of 0.079ha.
;;; UGX 955,195,790 was reported as payables of which UGX.624,097,536 was accrued during the year. The payables arose from
;;;over commitment beyond the approved estimates as appropriated by Parliament for the financial year.
;;; Out of 424 approved staff positions only 286 (67%) posts were filled, leaving 138 (33%) positions vacant.
;;; I noted that whereas a contractor for the remodelling and expansion of a store at Nakasero prepared and submitted building
;;;plans to UBTS, there was no evidence that these plans had been submitted to KCCA and subsequently approved.
;;;Implementation of unapproved building plans poses a risk of financial loss in the event that the responsible Authority
;;;(Metropolitan Authority/KCCA) refused to approve the plans and directed the demolition of the works already done.
;;; Records of 313,975 units of blood collected and recorded on the Blood Safety Information system indicated that 252,178 units
;;;of blood were dispatched to 488 health units. However, there was no record of blood received and issued by health Units on
;;;the District Health Information System (DHIS2) to enable verification of data entered in the DHIS2. Tracing of blood to the
;;;‘last mile’ or user becomes difficult and renders the accountability cycle for the blood units incomplete.
