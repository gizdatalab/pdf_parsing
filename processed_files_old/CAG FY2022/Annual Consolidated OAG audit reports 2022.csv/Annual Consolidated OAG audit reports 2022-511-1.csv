These activities include construction under the EACOP Project, the Refinery Project, Kabaale Industrial Park, construction of the oil Jetty and Pipeline at JST, as well as undertaking the Engineering Procurement and Construction activities at the Kampala Storage Terminal. A review of the approved structure and the staff list revealed that out of the 261 approved posts for the company, only 114 (44%) were filled leaving 145 (56%) posts vacant. Internal Audit did not review the ICT systems that produce financial statements. There is a risk that internal control weaknesses related to ICT system may not be detected timely.;;;
