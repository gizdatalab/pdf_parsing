      During the FY 2020/21, UCECPS realised only UGX.0.311Bn but expended UGX.0.332Bn, representing 106.74% of the realised monies. I noted that the expenditure exceeded the cash collection, and payments were made using the cash balances carried forward from FY 2019/2020. I established from the statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits on page 14 of the financial statements that the current assets amounting to UGX.4,550,343,000 was due from government. This arose after management on the advice of government, diverted money from the Defined Contributions (DC) active members Fund to pay the increased monthly pensions to the Defined Benefits members, thus creating a deficit/Liability to the scheme. PS/ST directed that UCECPS transfer the files of all pensioners of UPTC to the line Ministry of Information Communication Technology and National Guidance (MoICT&NG) to facilitate the payment of the pensioners effective FY 2020/2021 in accordance with the decentralisation policy. I noted however that, the decision to streamline pension payments has created uncertainty on the continuity of UCECPSs. During the year under review, the scheme expected a total sum of UGX.331,340,796 from the Employer (UTL) as a contribution to the members. However, only UGX.310,962,857 was remitted relating to arrears which in turn led to the monthly interest which accumulated to UGX.112,119,561. The total amounts due from the employers (UTL) had accumulated to UGX.4,171,050,819 as of 30th June 2021. PAYE of UGX.44,867,514 withheld from employees as required during the year was never remitted to URA by the year end. I further noted that the accumulated PAYE arrears stood at UGX.241,677,000. I noted that the board was not fully constituted as the Government (Founder) had only appointed one representative as of 30th June 2021;;;
52. Uganda Institute of Communication Technology (UICT). Unqualified Opinion;;;" Out of the approved budget for the financial year of UGX.11.4Bn, only UGX.6.1Bn was collected by the entity resulting into an under-collection of UGX.5.3Bn representing a performance level of 53.5%. As a result, I noted that of the 15 quantified activities worth UGX.3.95Bn assessed; no activities were fully implemented, while 15 activities representing 100% were partially implemented. Failure to fully implement planned activities negatively impacts service delivery."
;;;
;;; I noted that the staff establishment showed that only thirty-seven (37) positions (38%) were filled out of the
;;;established ninety-seven (97) positions leaving sixty (60) positions vacant (62%). Most of the vacant positions
;;;were key positions that are required to achieve the mandate of the Institute. Failure to fill the staff establishment
;;;hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Institute.
;;; The Institute was among the 11 entities selected for implementation of Electronic Government Procurement (EGP)
;;;system, and hence was required to conduct all its procurement process on the EGP system effective 1/July/2021.
;;;However, I noted that the Institute faced a number operational challenges that affected the timely implementation
;;;"of planned procurements. These included;"
;;;"• The system was unable to update the procurement file directory where; procurement is retendered,"
;;;where a requisition is rejected before final approval, where procurement is reinstated due to inadequate
;;;statement of requirements and where procurement is cancelled.
