;;;Management agreed to work closely with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED)
;;;and the Parish Development Model (PDM) Secretariat to develop a clear proposal for MoFPED to consider scaling

;;;November 2022, to ensure that grant funds are fully and properly utilized, and that outcome measurement of the
;;;grant is facilitated. During audit examination, I however noted that the contracts have not been signed and
;;;implemented.

  I noted that, as reported in my report for the year ended 30th June 2020, Government of Uganda has not yet honored its obligation of UGX.5.6Bn as co-funding for the Project. The project entirely depended on the IFAD funding in implementing its activities I observed that the project has been supporting SACCO’s that were not registered by Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA). Un-registered SACCO’s are unregulated and this could result into loss of member deposits and endanger the sustainability of the Project-supported SACCOs. 10.

  Out of the total warrants of UGX.10.833Bn received during the financial year UGX.10.562Bn was utilized by the Directorate resulting into unutilized warrants of UGX.0.562Bn, representing absorption level of 97.5%. Un utilised warrants signify failure to utilise availed funds which negatively impacts service delivery. Out of the domestic arrears balance of UGX.442Mn at the beginning of the year, only UGX.122Mn (28%) was paid, while the balance of UGX.319Mn still remained outstanding during the Financial Year 2021/2022. Delayed settlement of arrears could lead to costly litigation and loss to government. 12. Directorate for Ethics and Integrity (DEI) Unqualified Opinion;;;
