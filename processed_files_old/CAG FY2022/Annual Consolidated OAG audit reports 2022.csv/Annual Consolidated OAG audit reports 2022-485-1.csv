;;;; The vote had accumulated domestic arrears of UGX.380, 245,920 relating to acquisition of IT system.
;;;;Accumulation of domestic arrears indicates non-compliance to the commitment control system and stifles the
;;;;private sector growth and may lead to unnecessary ligation costs.
;;;;" I review the IT investment and not that;"
;;;;o The IT investment projects were behind schedule
;;;;o Three systems with an acquisition cost of UGX.642,797,920 did not meet the user requirements and
;;;;did not have any automated mechanisms to share information (integrated) which may lead to
;;;;duplication of system and defeating rationalisation policy.
;;;;o There was no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security
;;;;Policy 2014 which may lead to loss of data in case of disaster.
;;;;o The entity was preparing financial statements off the system rendering the financial statements prone
;;;;to errors.

8.;The Ministry charged wrong expenditure codes leading to mischarge of UGX.5.3Bn. I observed that, although the PS/ST authorized the change in the Ministry’s workplan to enable the Accounting Officer to utilize the funds requested, for renovation of premises as opposed to rent, the ministry has not recorded the resulting prepayment, since the amount is question is to be recovered through rental deductions, following an MoU signed with Uganda Property Holdings Limited, who own the premises that were renovated. Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares (100%) costing UGX.0.822Bn were not recorded in the Ministry’s land register. In addition, Property comprised in Plots 9, 11 and 13 Corporation rise - Bukoto Kampala, valued at UGX.1.935Bn (Land - UGX.1.77Bn and Developments UGX.159.8 Mn) had no land title and was not disclosed in the memorandum Statement. Failure to properly record all public land could cpmplicate proper follow up of such land. Four (4) pieces of land measuring approximately 3.107 hectares held by the Ministry did not have Land titles, yet they were acquired over 16 years ago. This exposes such land to a risk of loss through encroachment and land grabbing. Five (5) plots acquired by Government of Uganda to resettle the metal fabricators previously operating along Katwe road under their association Katwe Small Scale Industrial Development Association (KSIDA), measuring approximately 0.435 hectares (14%) and costing UGX.0.505Bn was irregularly transferred to KSIDA as the user under Uganda Land Commission instead of Ministry of Trade as the rightful user. Land measuring 1.462 hectares (47%) acquired at UGX.0.217Bn out of the 3.107 hectares of land owned by the Ministry, had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions and encroachment as there was a legal challenge with a private company. I observed that the Ministry disclosed domestic arrears as at 30th June 2022 of UGX.4.2Bn (2020/2021: UGX.16.4Bn). I noted that although the ministry settled a total of UGX.12.3Bn in lieu of subscription fees to       Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives Industry and Unqualified Opinion;;;
