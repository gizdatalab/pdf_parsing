    The Directorate of Ethics and Integrity (DEI) has an approved staff structure of 122, but only 54 (44.3%) were filled leaving 68 (55.7%) positions unfilled. Failure to fill the staff establishment hampers service delivery and adversely affects the day-to-day running of the Directorate. Management spent a total of UGX.248.883Mn on micro procurements without use of request for quotations, contrary to the PPDA Act Section 79 (1) Subsection 5(C) and 7(C) Fourth Schedule, that specifies the conditions for use of Procurement Methods for Micro Procurement and Quotation and proposal method. This could lead to uncompetitive prices and failure to maximize value for money. The Directorate irregularly used direct procurement for the purchase of vehicles at a cost of UGX.1.046Bn, contrary to PPDA Guidelines 2014 Paragraph 1, Thresholds for Procurement of supplies and non-consultancy services, method. This could also lead to uncompetitive prices and failure to maximize value for money. A review of the governance structures indicated that there was neither specific structure that steers and oversees ICT implementation nor an approved IT staff structure while at the same time the expected ICT Unit of two staff, only one position had been filled.;;;

"    Out of the approved budget of UGX.8.370Bn, a total of UGX.8.310Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.06Bn representing 0.72% of the approved budget. I further noted that of the total warrants of UGX.8.310Bn, the Board spent a total of UGX.7.528Bn resulting into unspent warrants of UGX.0.782Bn. Unreleased and unutilised funds signify failure to implement all the planned activities which negatively impacts service delivery. The Board remained understaffed with only had 36 positions out of 51 approved positions leaving a gap of 15 positions, representing 30% of the approved structure. Understaffing constrains effective service delivery. The Board failed to prepare 4 Statutory Regulations to regulate the industry contrary to the provision of Section 70 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015. I noted that the entity failed to prepare a National Register of gaming or betting machines and devices, as provided for under Section 36 of the Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2015. Absence of a register of machines and equipment being used in the industry, complicates monitoring and renewal of licences and also exposes the industry players to risks of using inappropriate machinery and equipment.  I carried out a review of management of IT investments at the entity and noted that; o 138 IT assets (100%) inspected over the period under review were not accurately recorded in the Assets register. 14.
