"   The average annual quality of service performance for the distribution companies, especially those operating in rural areas was 60%, while that of UMEME was 90%. There are inadequacies in the awareness of the existence of the rebate policy, which has resulted in only two (2) rebate applications being processed, with an expected installed capacity addition of 9.1 MVA. A review of the management of IT investments revealed inadequacies including; failure to seek clearance from NITA(U) on acquisitions, non-integration of IT systems and applications, lack of a specific structure to steer and oversee ICT implementation, staffing gap and failure by Internal audit to review the ICT systems that produce financial statements.";;;

;;; I noted that out of the available funds for the year totalling to USD.1.549Mn comprising an opening balance of
;;;USD.0.655Mn and USD 0.894Mn received during the year, only a total of USD 0.82Mn was utilised during the year,

As at 30th June 2022, 5 years into implementation, it was noted that only USD.2.815Mn (80.4%) had been released to the project of which only USD.2.085Mn (74.1%) had been spent hence putting the overall loan absorption at 59.6% by 30th June 2022. The project was expected to close on 31st October 2022 but has since been granted

  I noted that the project Statement of Financial Position included an amount of UGX 17.71 billion, being the Project cash balance as at 31st December 2021. However, management did not open a separate bank account for the project as required by the Grant Agreement (Clause 5.6) and Chapter 13 of UEGCL’s Finance Regulations Manual. Co-mingling of grant funds with other funds makes them susceptible to misuse, and it renders it difficult to easily ascertain the accuracy of the project balances. In the period under review, I noted that the absorption of budgeted funds was only NOK.2.274m of the budgeted NOK.30.278m, representing a 7.5% absorption level. Low funds absorption leads to delayed implementation of critical project activities, which may hinder project effectiveness. 3.
