;;;; Under the JLOS SWAP project, MoLG planned to print 100,000 copies of the local council register and to undertake
;;;;training of Local Council I, II, and III Courts in 30 Local Governments. Only 48,000 copies out of the 100,000
;;;;copies were printed, while training was only 53% (7,980) of the target number of training were conducted.
;;;; I noted a misalignment in the construction of prisons. Whereas the JLOS SWAP project provides funding for the
;;;;construction of prison wards, there is no concurrent funding for the construction of staff quarters, even when
;;;;prisons cannot operate without staff.
;;;; I noted cumulative and persistent underfunding of the project. Over a period of three (3) years, the total approved
;;;;budget has been UGX.337Bn however, UGX.219Bn has been availed, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.118Bn.
;;;; I further noted that of the availed UGX.219Bn in the last three financial years, the entities have failed to absorb
;;;;UGX.43Bn. Under absorption affects the timely delivery of services.
;;;; I noted that the project does not have a detailed risk assessment policy, risk-management guidelines and risk
;;;;register as required under the Treasury Instructions. As a result, all project-specific risks may not be assessed in
;;;;time, and robust risk management and mitigation measures implemented. In addition, risk management
;;;;procedures may not be well coordinated and consistently applied across all of the JLOS SWAP implementing
;;;;entities.
;;;; I noted delays in completing construction projects in eight (8) implementing entities. The Accounting Officers
;;;;attributed the delays to late or partial release of funds, failure to complete procurement processes on time and
;;;;disruptions due to the Covid pandemic in some cases.
4.;     Out of the budgeted revenue of UGX.127.64Bn for the financial year 2020/2021, only UGX.73.03Bn (57.2%) was released, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.54.60Bn (42.8%). A comparison of the disbursement of JLOS SWAP funds to implementing entities and the actual expenditure revealed that out of the available sum of UGX. 123Bn, only UGX. 73Bn was spent, and Letters of Credit amounting to UGX.1.2Bn performed, resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.48.7Bn. I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities by management and noted that all of the programme activities were quantified in the annual work plans. I assessed the implementation of 507 outputs/activities for the Programme that were fully quantified worth UGX.74.267Bn for the year under audit. I noted the 165 outputs/activities worth UGX.17.327Bn were fully implemented. The entities implemented the activities (100%) within these outputs, 220 outputs/activities worth UGX. 37.945Bn were partially implemented, 122 outputs/activities worth UGX.18.9952Bn were not implemented at all. During the financial year 2020/2021, the JLOS SWAP project provided funding amounting to UGX. 8,507,209,099 for constructing twenty-two (22) infrastructural development projects across the entire sector and country. A review of the project progress revealed that four (4) projects for which UGX. 2,570,000,000 was released during the year have experienced delays or stalled.
