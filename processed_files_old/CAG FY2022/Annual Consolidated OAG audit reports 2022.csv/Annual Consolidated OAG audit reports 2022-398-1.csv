implies a significant failure of revenue collection strategies employed by the institution which may impact its sustainability. It was further allocated supplementary funding of UGX.527.8Mn for the PRESIDE research project, of which UGX.343.9Mn was received during the financial year and the balance received shortly after the close the financial year as a result, out of the 23 outputs assessed, 14 outputs representing 61% were fully implemented and 6 outputs representing 26% were partially implemented and 3 outputs representing 13% were not implemented. Failure tp fully implement planned activities may lead to inability to attain the intended project objectives. PBID has a secondary processing plant, which turns matooke chips into matooke flour with a capacity of 1 tonne per hour. During the audit, I was not provided with details of output during the period, but my anaysis of revenue reported during the year shows only UGX.295Mn was attained against a budget of UGX.2.757Bn. This implies the plant is grossly under utilised. Of the UGX.295Mn that was reported as collections from operations, only UGX.99Mn was banked. Out of the unbanked revenue of UGX.196Mn, only UGX.153.9Mn was accounted for in form of cash payments leaving a balance of UGX.42Mn unaccounted for. There is a risk that this amount was not put to proper use. PIBID lacked land titles for its land at Sanga (approximately 50 acres) and land located at Kyamuhanga (approximately 4 acres) exposing the land to the risk of encroachment and land grabbing. PIBID does not have an approved salary structure on which it pays individual staff. It should be noted that this issue has been re-occurring and Management has not taken action. Contracts totalling UGX.1.228Bn were signed by the entity without the approval of the Solicitor General contrary to Article 119 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995 (as amended). This exposes government to risks of unfavaourable contractual terms and potential loss.      ;;;
5. Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) Unqualified Opinion;;;I reviewed the approved budget for the financial year 2021/2022 and noted that the entity had a revenue budget of UGX.43.14Bn during the year under review. By the end of the year only UGX.29.10Bn had been realized, representing a performance of 32.9% of the target 
;;;
;;; I noted that the entity only had a budget of UGX5.5bn for land purchase during the period under review, but went
;;;ahead and spent UGX.8.5bn resulting in an irregular over payment of UGX.3bn.
;;; The Uganda Land Commission was not involved in the procurement of the land since the entity did not obtain any
;;;approvals from ULC as required. Similarly, the title of the land was not transferred to the names of ULC by
;;;Management as required by the land Act.
;;; Out of the approved staff structure of 70 positions, 55 were filled leaving 15 positions unfilled.
I noted that the Company has an operating margin of 7.1%, which is below 15% which is generally recommended. The current year operating ratio however is 5.9% above the ratio of the previous year 2020/2021.  6. National Enterprise Corporation (NEC) Farm Katonga. Opinion;;;
