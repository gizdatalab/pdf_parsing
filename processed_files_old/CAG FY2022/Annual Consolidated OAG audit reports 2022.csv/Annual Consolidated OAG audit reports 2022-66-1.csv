SN Observation Recommendation;;;;
This resulted into financial loss to the affected staff. “Active” deductions report and “my approvals” report in the PDMS should have consistent deduction amounts to give confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the system. A comparison of the “active deductions” and “my approvals” reports in the PDMS revealed that there were variances in deduction amounts. Details are in Appendix 1 k. Lack of integrity of the system creates opportunities for manipulation of the deduction which could result into financial loss to the affected employees. Details are in Appendix 1 k. The Accounting Officers explained that entities had no control over the challenges above in the management of non-statutory deductions in the PDMS system by UCLA/UBA. The Accounting Officers further explained that the issues would be resolved if the LGs do not have rights for coding and decoding of deductions.

3.1.10;Use of wrong formula to compute statutory deductions;;;
;;;;I advised MoPs to
;Section 22 1(d) of the Income Tax Act as amended by;;;engage the
;Amendment Act of 2008 provides that for the purpose of;;;Attorney General
;ascertaining the chargeable income of a person for a year of;;;to have the above
;income, Local Service Tax paid by an individual should be an;;;contradiction
;allowable deduction.;;;resolved.
;;;;
;The Local Governments (Amendment) (No. 2) Act of 2008;;;
;defined “take-home salary” as gross salary after deducting;;;
;income tax in the form of Pay as You Earn (PAYE) and;;;
;prescribed the rates of local service tax in respect of;;;
;persons in gainful employment and earning a monthly take-;;;
;home salary.;;;
;;;;
;I noted a contradiction between the Income Tax Act and the;;;
;Local Government Act in regard to computation of PAYE and;;;
;LST. The contradictions result from the Income Tax treating LST;;;
;as an allowable deduction when computing PAYE while the Local;;;
;Government Act treats PAYE as an allowable deduction when;;;
;computing LST.;;;
;;;;
;Consequently, the contradiction has resulted to over deduction;;;
;of PAYE of UGX.3,040,220,504 and under deduction of;;;
;UGX.2,387,243,619 from 75,094 employees in 96 LGs. This has;;;
;also resulted into under deduction of LST of UGX.682,208,048;;;
;and over deduction of UGX.1,043,454,067 from 94,892;;;
;employees in 102 LGs which is a loss to Government. Details;;;
;are in Appendix 1 l.;;;
