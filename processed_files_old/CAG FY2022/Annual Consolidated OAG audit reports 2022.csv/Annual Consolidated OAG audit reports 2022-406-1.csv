"  Inspection of the progress of the project works at four (4) sites revealed that; works at Kyanja had stalled, delayed completion of works at Kalerwe and inadequate contract management at Nakawa, City Square and Kalerwe. This affects service delivery. The project had accumulated arrears amounting to USD 340,298 at the end of the financial year.";;;
8. National Planning Authority Unqualified Opinion;;;" Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.37.60Bn, only UGX.37.60Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.004Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. As a result, I noted that out of the 6 quantified activities worth UGX.8.62Bn assessed; 3 activities representing 50% were fully implemented, 3 activities representing 50% were partially implemented and no activity was not implemented."
;;;
;;;
;;;
;;; The Authority experienced implementation challenges of some activities within the planned time frames, affecting
;;;service delivery.
;;; Out of the approved staffing level of 181, only 126 positions were filled (69.6%), leaving a staffing gap of 55
;;;positions (19.3%).
;;; I noted inadequate top-level support in the transition from sector to program approaches to planning and budgeting
;;;as only the P/Ss’ of the convening Ministries attend the programme working group (PWG) meetings. The rest were
;;;lower cadre officers, which lowered the level of the technical discussions. Program Working Groups were generally
;;;not functional and had not played their coordination roles basically due to lack of human, financial, and logistical
;;;resources.
;;; I noted that at the sub-programme level, the coordination arrangements amongst the development partners, the
;;;private sector, and the civil society groups were sluggish over the first half of the NDPIII.
;;; There was delayed approval of strategic plans at only 86% due to non-compliance and delays in responding by
;;;the respective MDAs’ and LGs’ to the various review comments raised by NPA.
;;; I noted delayed realignment of the CNDPF to program planning approach, which affected the proper guidance of
;;;entities in undertaking planning activities.
;;; I noted that there was a lack of a follow-up mechanism for ensuring that NPA recommendations on CoC issues are
;;;implemented to improve budget compliance in the subsequent years.
;;; I noted that there was lack of programme planning capacity in both MDAs and LGs as, by the time of the MTR,
;;;LGs were yet to produce programme-based BFPs despite being allowed to undertake budget expenditure.
;;; I observed that there was no adjustment or risk mitigation strategy which allowed Government to adjust the plan
;;;throughout the implementation period in line with the available financial resources and the external environment
;;;while keeping the broad focus constant.
