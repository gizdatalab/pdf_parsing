;;;; I noted that the buildings located at UBOS Entebbe Office were in a poor state, and are were due for demolition.
;;;;Although UBOS has an architectural plan for redevelopment of the UBOS office into the East African Bureau of
;;;;Statistics and a training centre, funding for the construction works has not yet been secured.
;;;; I noted that Parish Development Model (PDM) baseline data collection exercise had only commenced in 169 out
;;;;of 181 Higher Local Governments (HLGs) and the exercise was incomplete and behind schedule at a completion
;;;;rate of 41%. The data processing at the Bureau had also been affected by limited access granted by the Ministry
;;;;of ICT and National Guidance (MOICT&NG) to the data collected from the local governments which is affecting the
;;;;initial implementation of Parish Development Model.
;;;; I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.1.08Bn were not executed as of 30th June 2022. As a result,
;;;;implementation of critical government programs was delayed.
;;;;" I noted inadequate management of grants from development partners relating to three projects under the Bureau;"
;;;;
;;;;o I observed that the Bureau received UGX.5.15Bn from the Ministry of Education and Sports for the Baseline
;;;;Education Census Project funded by World Bank. However, I noted that the exercise was delayed and only
;;;;UGX.1.2Bn had been utilized by the time of audit (November 2022) for the recruitment, procurement of
;;;;tools for the census, and training of project staff.
;;;;
;;;;o During the FY 2021/2022, the Bureau received UGX.2.14Bn for the project: Support of the Advancement
;;;;of the Uganda Annual Agricultural Survey (AAS). However, the Bureau failed to absorb part of the funds
;;;;and refunded UGX.1.87Bn to the FAO International Representative.
;;;;
;;;; Failure to absorb project funds leads to delayed service delivery.
;;;;
38.;The Authority had a revenue collection target of UGX.22,802.62Bn, out of which UGX.22,098.06Bn (96.9%) was collected. Under-collection of revenue affects the overall delivery of Public services by the Government. Out of the planned 493 compliance audits, only 227 (46%) were carried out, implying that the corrective actions that would have been undertaken to enhance tax compliance were impeded. This negatively affected revenue collection. Despite several tax heads having 0 (zero) budgeted revenue, a total of UGX.370.58Bn was collected from the tax heads in question - contrary to the provisions in Paragraph 4.19.3 of the Treasury Instructions, 2017 and Section 45(3) of the PFMA, 2015. URA did not have documented step-wise processes on the importation and exportation of precious minerals. As result, the Gold exports were not being captured in the customs systems – ASYCUDA and Taxes arising out of Gold exportation to the tune of UGX.340.56Bn were not collected.     Unqualified URA Corporate Opinion;;;
