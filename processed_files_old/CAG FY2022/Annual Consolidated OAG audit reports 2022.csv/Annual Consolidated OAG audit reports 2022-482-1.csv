;;; The financial statements revealed that UPL’s payables increased by UGX.1.9Bn from UGX.14.79Bn as at 30 th June 2021 to UGX.16.69Bn in financial year 30 th June 2022. Accumulation of payables creates a risk of litigation
;;;that may lead to payment of penalties and fines for delayed settlement to possible aggrieved parties in future.
;;; A review of UPL’s staff list as at 30 th June 2022 and the approved Organisation Structure revealed that out of the
;;;staff establishment of 247, only 172 positions were filled, leading to a staffing gap of 75 (30.4%). Inadequacy in
;;;staffing leads to inability to fully carry out the mandate hence negatively negatively impacting on staff performance,
;;;service delivery and attainmant of company objectives.
;;;" The following aspects were noted in regard to management land by UPL;"
;;;
;;;o The Company did not renew leases for three (3) pieces of land. The entity has taken an average of 14
;;;years from the time of expiry of the lease term without having them renewed. This exposes such land to a
;;;risk of loss.
;;;o I noted that 10 pieces of land did not have their sizes recorded in the land register either in acres or
;;;hectares as required. I also noted that 8 pieces of land did not have a value attached to them in form of
;;;cost of valuation amount.
;;;o I noted that 1 piece of land measuring approximately 0.464 hectares (5.8%) valued at UGX.1.147Bn was
;;;not being utilized by the entity.
;;;o I noted that 1 piece of land measuring 0.612 hectares (7.5 %) valued at UGX 0.465Bn out of the 8.06798
;;;hectares of land owned by the entity had encumbrances in the form of court injunctions.
;;;o It was observed that Uganda Post was paid UGX.2.81Bn as compensation for the land and building.
;;;However, I did not obtain the details of the application of these monies after the asset was sold off.
;;;o There was no revaluation carried out over the past eight years. Non-asset revaluation implies the carrying
;;;amounts of the assets in the financial statements may be misstated.
