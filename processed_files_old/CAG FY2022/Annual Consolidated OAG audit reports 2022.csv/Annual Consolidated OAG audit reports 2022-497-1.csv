Opinion Unqualified;;;budgeted GoU revenue of UGX 17.88Bn by the Authority, only UGX 14.18Bn was warranted representing
;;;performance of 79% of the target.

;;; I noted that whereas Section 32 (1) of the National Environment Act, 2019 requires the establishment of the
;;;National Environment Fund, I noted that the fund was not operational, and a sum of UGX. 5,933,507,497 was
;;;collected and deposited into the Consolidated Fund by Uganda Revenue Authority, thus denying the authority
;;;access to statutory funds
;;; I noted that whereas Section 25(1)) of the National Environment Act, 2019 requires the establishment of the
