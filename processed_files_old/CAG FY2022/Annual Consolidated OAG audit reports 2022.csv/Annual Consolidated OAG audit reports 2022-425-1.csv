;;; Out of seven priority areas prescribed in the mission charter only three (3) areas were quantified. Failure to quantify
;;;activities constrained evaluation of performance.
;;; The Geneva mission incurred a total of CHF 259,200 (UGX.1,015,690,752) on annual rent comprising CHF 157,200
;;;for the chancery and CHF 102,000 for the official Residence. Mortgage financing could help the mission acquire its
;;;own property if well negotiated and hence minimize rental costs.
;;; Whereas the staffing structure provides for the position of Foreign Service Officer (FSO) Grade III, it was not filled.
;;;It was further noted that there is no provision for FSO II and yet it is filled while three (3) FSOIV are in place and
;;;yet the structure provides for only one(I). Unharmonized staffing presents a challenge for budget management.
