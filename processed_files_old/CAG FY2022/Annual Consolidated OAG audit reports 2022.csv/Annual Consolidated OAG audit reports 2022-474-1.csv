A total of UGX.17.786Bn was received to be spent on different outputs during the year under review, and only UGX.9.155Bn (51%) was utilized leading to under-absorption of UGX.8.634Bn (49%). As a result, several planned activities were not implemented. A review of the contract for the production of base maps for land administration in Uganda awarded to a firm at a contract price of Euros 4,712,135 revealed a contract performance of 89% despite having paid Euros 4,294,439 (91.1%) of the contract price.   44.

Unqualified 45. PPDA Tribunal. Opinion;;; The budget for the Tribunal was not aligned to its strategic plan creating a risk of the entity not achieving its long
;;;term objectives. The Tribunal did not maintain a detailed risk register of risks that may affect the implementation of activities as detailed in the approved work plans and budgets. I noted that there was no segregation of duties between the function of the Board of the Tribunal and the  

;;;Administrative Function. This is because the members of the Tribunal execute both functions.
"The Authority collected revenue UGX.20.02Bn out of a budget of UGX.21.55Bn. This was in addition to balance brought forward of UGX.7.69Bn resulting in total funds available amounting to UGX.27.71Bn. I reviewed the Authority’s budget implementation and noted that out of the 67 quantified activities assessed worth UGX.2.314Bn; 36 activities representing 54% were fully implemented, 18 activities representing 27% were partially implemented, while 13 activities representing 19% were not implemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities delays service delivery. IRA has a staffing structure totaling to one hundred and nine (109) staff of which eighty-six (86) staff positions (i.e. 78% of the approved structure) filled, leaving a balance of twenty-three (23) positions (22%) vacant. Understaffing impacts on the entity’s capacity to effectively execute their mandate. Procurements to the tune of UGX.5.822Bn were not undertaken as of 30th June 2022. As a result, implementation of critical planned programs was delayed.    46. Insurance Regulatory Authority. Unqualified Opinion";;;
