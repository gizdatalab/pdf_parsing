  The approved structure for URBRA provides a staff ceiling of 73, however, I observed that only 42 positions (57.5%) were filled, hence a staffing gap of 31 positions (42.5%) which includes key positions such as one Director and eight (8) manager positions. This limits the Authority’s capacity to duly implement all its mandate. A review of the Authority’s procurement plan, procurement files and the annual procurement report/register, indicated that procurements worth UGX.0.114Bn were not implemented. This in turn leads to delayed delivery of services.;;;
41. Financial Intelligence Authority. Opinion Unqualified;;; I noted that the entity did not budget to collect NTR during the year but collected UGX.13Mn. Failure to budget for revenue leads to unauthorized collections and makes it impossible to measure performance.

;;;" Review of the entity’s staffing structures revealed that out of the total approved structure of 86 staff, only 41 (48.8%) positions were filled and 45 (51.2%) positions had not yet been filled. These included the key posts of; Director Legal, Inspection and Compliance, Director Audit, Director Finance and Administration among others. Understaffing contrains the entity’s capacity to effectively deliver its mandate."

;;; The Authority made procurements for a total of UGX0.551Mn without conducting market assessments. Lack of
;;;market surveys is not only irregular, but also implies procurements could have been executed at uncompetitive
;;;prices, hence impacting on value for money.
ITC had an approved budget of UGX.9.177Bn of which UGX.8.325Bn was realized, leading to a shortfall of UGX.0.852Bn representing 9.9%% of the budget. I further noted that out of the total receipts for the year, only UGX.6.332Bn was expensed, leading to a surplus of UGX.1.992Bn representing 69% absorption. Also noted was that out of the eleven (11) planned activities, the entity fully implemented five (5) activities, while four (4) activities were partially implemented, and two (2) activities remained unimplemented. Failure to fully implement all planned activities negatively impacts service delivery. ITC acquired fourteen (14) IT assets worth UGX.326.9Mn without clearance from NITA-U. Such non-compliance with the government policies and guidelines may lead to duplication of acquisition, non-compatible solutions which can lead to loss to government.   42.

43. Tax Appeals Tribunal. 2021/22 Unqualified Opinion;;;  The entity budgeted for UGX.7.6Bn, out of which UGX.7.4Bn was received, resulting into a deficit of UGX.240Mn. The deficit represents 3.2% of the approved budget. The deficit in the budget negatively impacted service delivery. The entity had an ambitious plan of one hundred fifty thousand and nine hundred twenty (150,920) planned activities worth UGX.2.8Bn, out of which, only seven hundred and eighteen (1,718) activities were fully
;;;
;;;implemented, hence limiting delivery of the entity’s mandate and service delivery.
;;; A total of 163 tax appeal cases worth UGX.882.6Bn were pending, resulting into locking potential government
;;;revenue in dispute.
