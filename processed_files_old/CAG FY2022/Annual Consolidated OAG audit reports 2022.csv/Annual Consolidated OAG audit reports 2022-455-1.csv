    Out of the budgeted UGX.9.428Bn a total of UGX.8.259Bn was warranted, resulting into a shortfall of UGX.1.169Bn. The shortfall represents 12% of the approved budget. Out of the total of UGX.8.727Bn that was available during the financial year, only UGX.5.819Bn was spent by the entity resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.2.907Bn representing an absorption level of 67%. I noted that out of the approved staffing level of 101, only 29 positions were filled (28%) leaving a staffing gap of 72 positions (72%). A review of the ICT governance structure of the entity revealed that despite the deployment of the Building Industry Management System (BIMS) countrywide, there are no specific structures that steer and oversee IT implementation, no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity and no business continuity plan contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy 2014. 16.

17. National Building Review Board (NBRB) 2021 Unqualified Opinion;;; I noted that, whereas NBRB had an approved five year strategic plan by the Board, it had not been reviewed and approved by NPA to facilitate compliance to national planning requirements and its alignment to the NDP III infrastructure sector priorities. There is a risk that some activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the full realization of NDP-III sector objectives.

;;; Although 49 positions were required to be filled during the year under audit, I noted that by the end of the year

Unqualified 1. National Physical Planning Board (NPPB) Opinion;;;" Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.4.469Bn, UGX.4.469Bn was spent by the entity representing an absorption level of 100%. I noted that of the 06 quantified activities worth UGX.0.768Bn assessed; five (5) activities representing 83% were partially implemented while one (1) activity representing 17% was not implemented. I observed that the budgets for the six outputs assessed were not supported by individual activity costings/budgets and the Board did not submit performance reports for the year under review."
