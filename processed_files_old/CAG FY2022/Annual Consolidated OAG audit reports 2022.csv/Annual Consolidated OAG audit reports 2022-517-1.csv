A review of the ARSDP Project Financing Agreement signed on the 24th August, 2015 indicated that the project which was supposed to end on 30th June, 2019 had its completion date revised thrice to 31st December 2022 due to delayed commencement. I noted that the mid-Term Bursary Scheme Review Report had not been produced hindering timely remedial actions which may affect the Project’s ability to achieve its intended objectives. I noted that there were some Bursary scheme management activities which were not achieved, such as the development of a framework for transfer of knowledge to the client staff and the design of a tracking system to monitor training providers and trainees.   ;;;

This delayed implementation of project activities. I noted that the project requisitioned funds to undertake different activities during the year.
