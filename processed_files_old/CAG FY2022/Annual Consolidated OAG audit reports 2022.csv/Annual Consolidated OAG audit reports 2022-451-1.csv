"I noted that UNRA delayed to pay the Contractor’s Interim Payment Certificate (IPC) within the stipulated days in the contract thereby incurring UGX.609,061,148 and USD.130,733.97 in finance charges UNRA signed contracts with three companies to relocate utilities along the project road for a total cost of UGX. 5,887,444,880 against a budget amount of UGX. 3 Billion thereby resulting into an additional amount of UGX.2,887,444,880. This is an increase of 96% beyond the budgeted amount for this activity casting doubt to the comprehensiveness of the feasibility studies undertaken by the UNRA and the Contractor before BoQs were made. I noted that the progress of work did not match the remaining period to the completion date. The road works were estimated to be at 68%, the OSBP at 25% and Suam Bridge at 70% with just few months to reach contract completion date. I further noted that some of the project components had not been implemented at the time of audit these include; Training in labor based construction techniques, Refurbishment of a post-crash care center and procurement of theatre equipment. I noted that the contracts signed by the consultants required them to provide the Professional liability insurance of 110% of the contract value but those provided did not cover the entire period If there is no Insurance cover as per the PPDA regulations, UNRA will not have a fallback position in case the consultants do not meet their contractual obligations.       8.
