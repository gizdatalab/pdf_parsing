The company had a total outstanding statutory obligation of UGX.310,173,160 attributed to URA and NSSF. The delayed payment of statutory deductions may attract fines and penalties.

A review of the monthly Energy sales of Mubuku HPP for the FY 2021/2022 revealed that the plant evacuated 5,446.09 MWh, which translated into UGX.471,702,475. The plant’s annual available capacity is 21,960.00MWh which would result into revenue of UGX.1,927,690,934.This implies that the company was failing to generate revenue amounting to UGX.1,455,988,459 annually. I noted that the Company had not undertaken an environment Audit, contrary to Section 4.5.6 of the Generation license that requires the Licensee to provide to the Regulatory a detailed environmental audit on an annual basis.    ;;;
