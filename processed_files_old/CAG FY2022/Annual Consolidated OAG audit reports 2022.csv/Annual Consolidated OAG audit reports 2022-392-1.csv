the replacement of lost certificates is not catered for in the system, and the system allows filing of marriages from ungazetted churches. A trend analysis of the Bureau’s domestic arrears position for the past three years showed that arrears increased by 335% from UGX.1.47Bn in 2019/2020 to UGX.6.38Bn in 2021/2022. No budgetary provision was made to settle domestic arrears totalling UGX.4,516,077,833 in the year under audit. I reviewed the management of IT investments and noted that the entity receives insufficient funds to maintain IT hardware. In addition, the Bureau has no maintenance plan for IT systems, and routine maintenance of systems is not carried out. Instead, the Bureau relies on corrective maintenance of IT systems and equipment in response to user requests or when systems break down. A review of the Board of survey reports and the assets register revealed that 301 IT equipment had been used for periods exceeding ten (10) years and are due for disposal.   ;;;
17. The Ministry of Internal Affairs. Unqualified Opinion;;;"Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.67.55, UGX.67.08Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unutilised warrant of UGX.0.48Bn representing an absorption level of 99.3%. As a result, I noted that out of the twenty-three (23) planned outputs worth UGX.26.77Bn assessed; eight (8) outputs were fully implemented, while fifteen (15) outputs were partially implemented. "

;;; I noted a 97% increase in the number of reported incidents of trafficking in persons from 214 in the year 2021 to
;;;421 in the year 2022. In addition, only 78% of the victims are rescued and freed. The increase poses a security
;;;threat to the citizens and increases public outcry.
;;; The Ministry does not maintain a centralised database with statistics and detailed information relating to trafficking
;;;in persons despite receiving a donation of the software from the IOM. This makes it difficult to design interventions,
;;;plan for victims’ support and link trafficking cases across different regions of the country.
;;; There are currently no reception shelters for accommodating the victims of trafficking in persons in the country,
;;;which renders the reintegration process difficult for returning victims and may reduce the chances of registering
;;;success in prosecuting trafficking in persons
;;;" I reviewed IT systems management; the Ministry’s ICT governance had several shortfalls. For instance, there were"
;;;no structures to oversee ICT implementation, no approved IT staff structure, and no IT risk management
;;;framework and business continuity policy.
"Out of the budgeted revenue of UGX.5Bn, only UGX.4.85Bn was received, representing a performance of 97% of the target. All funds received were fully absorbed. I assessed the implementation of the Bureau’s ten (10) outputs and noted that; five (5) were fully implemented, three (3) were partially implemented, and two (2) were not implemented at all. I reviewed the Bureau’s salary payments and noted that PAYE taxes amounting to UGX.255,190,100 were deducted from employee emoluments but were not remitted to URA.    Unqualified 18.
