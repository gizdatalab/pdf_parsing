18. Local Economic Growth Support (LEGS) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;; The project is yet to recover outstanding advances of US$ 1,208,100 in respect of ineligible payments made by the Microfinance Support Centre.
;;;
;;; The Project Steering Committee did not conduct any meeting during the year under review contrary to the
;;; requirements of the project appraisal document that requires the committee to meet on a biannual basis. The project procured coffee and vanilla seedlings worth UGX.1,499,000,000 which were not included in the
;;;procurement/work plan for the year ended 30th June 2021.
;;; Through field inspection in Alebtong district, I observed that some farmers received less coffee seedlings than
;;;those indicated in the distribution records held by Alebtong district local government. From a total of 12,100
;;;seedlings sampled from the distribution lists, only 2670 seedlings where acknowledged as received by the farmers
;;;and 9,430 seedlings not accounted for.
         Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.313.67Bn, only UGX.303.11Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.13.56Bn representing an absorption level of 95.7%. However, I could not assess the implementation of all the forty-six (46) outputs worth UGX.316Bn with 137 activities since they were not quantified. The Authority had a long-term liability of UGX.42Bn on its balance sheet from a development credit agreement entered. In addition, the entity had outstanding commitments to the tune of UGX.24.98Bn at the year-end and unremitted statutory deductions amounting to UGX.4.107Bn The Authority delayed the commencement of the Kampala Rehabilitation project by eleven (11) months after the intended effectiveness date. The entity incurred Nugatory expenditure -Interest on delayed payments worth UGX.94m The Authority managed to recover only UGX.1.46Bn out of UGX.4.628Bn YLP funds disbursed to the youth groups since the programme’s inception. I noted that the Authority had not yet come up with the regulations to operationalize the 2019 outdoor ordinance as such, could not collect revenue from outdoor advertising activities. I noted that 928 schools out of 1,927 were not registered with KCCA representing 48%, while provisional licenses for 102 schools out of the 134 schools with provisional licenses had expired, implying that the schools were operating illegally. I noted that Capital City Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had not been established, as I was not provided evidence of its existence and functionality. Despite 2022 being the final year (expiry of the ten years) of implementing the Consultancy recommendations on KPDP, the Authority had not prepared an implementation and evaluation report to evaluate the plan’s performance. 19.
