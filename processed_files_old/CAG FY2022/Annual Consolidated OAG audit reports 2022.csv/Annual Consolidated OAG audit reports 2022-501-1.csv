;;; I reviewed documents relating to the procurement/development of 3 (three) IT systems and noted that the systems
;;;are not owned by the entity which increases the risk of exposure to vendor manipulation. I noted that the Ministry
;;;has no specific structures that steer and oversee ICT implementation.
;;; The Ministry has no approved IT risk management framework/policy at the entity, and risk register. I also noted
;;;that the Ministry has no business continuity plan, contrary to Section 4.6 of the National Information Security Policy

;;;Cash flow statement and Financial statements for donor funded projects but rather, does it off the system using
;;;the financial statements templates provided by the Accountant General.
;;; Review of the e-Government Procurement (e-GP) system revealed that the Ministry approved a procurement plan
;;;for 1420 procurements estimated at a cost of UGX. 406.77Bn, but none of the procurement was completed on the
;;;system. I was not provided with contract management files for contract management files for 3 projects that were
;;;sampled for audit review.
