However, the Human resource officer confirmed that the correct annual salary of the one (01) pensioner as per the salary structure is UGX. 2,844,832 and the length of service 285 months. If calculated correctly then the CPG amount should have been UGX. 7,101,771 instead of UGX. 8,351,004 leading to an overpayment of UGX. 1,249,233. This was attributed to error in the computation of the gratuity.;;;;;;;;;;;
"v) Delayed deletion of staff from payroll Section B-a (12) of the Uganda Public Standing Orders, 2010 requires the payment of salary to public officers to be stopped immediately they cease rendering services to Government under whatever circumstances, including death. I noted that UGX. 39,616,954 was paid to 11 staff who had either retired, transferred, absconded or died as detailed in appendix 2. These were payment for services not rendered to the District resulting in loss of funds to Government. The Accounting Officer attributed to; non- validation status, inconsistencies in dates of birth, on IPPS and National IDs and the conditions set by the MoPS for correction of date of birth is so difficult to fulfil for pensioners who were recruited in service long time. this";;;;;;;;;;;I advised the Accounting Officer to ensure prompt removal of staff from the payroll.
