         The entity’s draft strategic plan had been aligned to the NDP-III at the time of audit and was awaiting certification from NPA due to delayed approval of the Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs). The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.4.625Bn but collected UGX.3.053Bn representing a performance of 66% of the target. There was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.11.216Bn representing 10.1%. Further, the entity remained with unspent balance of UGX.0.085Bn representing an absorption level of 99.9%. The entity received off-budget financing directly from development partners to a tune of UGX.49.77Bn out of which only UGX.38.19Bn was declared to the PSST and disclosed in the entity ministerial policy statement without a supplementary appropriation for the balance of UGX.11.58Bn. I sampled 8 outputs with 35 activities and expenditure of UGX.99.59Bn and noted that 7 outputs with 18 activities and expenditure worth UGX.45.070Bn were fully quantified while 1 output with 17 activities and expenditure worth UGX.54.52Bn was insufficiently quantified, of which 5 activities (29%) were quantified while 12 activities (71%) were not clearly quantified to enable measurement of performance. Further, I observed that out of the seven (7) outputs that were fully quantified, two (2) outputs with five (5) activities and expenditure worth UGX.5.186Bn were fully implemented while Five (5) outputs with thirteen (13) activities worth UGX.39.884Bn were partially implemented i.e. four (4) activities were fully implemented, eight (8) activities were partially implemented, while one (1) activity remained unimplemented. Submission of performance reports for all the quarters was made after the deadline dates. Fourteen (14) slow progressing competitive grant scheme (CGS) projects initiated in 2018/19 with funding of UGX.1.158Bn during the financial year 2020/2021 were still on-going despite expected completion date of June 2021. Civil works and Supplies Projects worth UGX.32,051,565,938 undertaken during the financial year were not yet handed over for use. Further, inspections of NARO facilities at institutes revealed poor road networks, broken down silos at the feed mill, non-functional water pump and abandoned works. There was failure to achieve the intended service delivery for the additional Civil Works at Rwebitaba ZARDI that costed UGX.418,584,880. This was due to lack of equipment in the laboratory.  Review of 9 sample procurements worth UGX.27,606,866,233 revealed an 5 National Agricultural Research Organization 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
