The Ministry’s strategic plan (2020/2021 to 2025/2026) had not been certified by NPA to confirm that it was well aligned to NDP III at the time of the audit. There was a shortfall in NTR collection of up to 89.9% of the target, while government receipts were less than anticipated by UGX.3.64Bn. The Ministry had unspent balances of UGX.3.94Bn by year-end. I noted that out of the thirty-nine (39) outputs sampled for review, fifteen (15) (38%) were fully quantified, twenty (20) (51%) were insufficiently quantified, and four (4) (10%) were not quantified at all. Out of the fifteen (15) outputs that were fully quantified, one (1) output was fully implemented, while fourteen (14) outputs were partially implemented. All the quarterly performance reports were submitted after the deadline for submission. 2,127 motorcycles and 77,831 bicycles worth UGX.18.9Bn and UGX.24.6Bn respectively had not yet been delivered by the time of audit in November 2021, although they were due for delivery in September 2021. The Ministry delayed disbursing funds for budget support to Local Governments. UGX.22.1Bn to various Local Governments was disbursed in the last two weeks of June 2021. The Ministry delayed disbursing start-up costs of UGX.6.79Bn to 125 Local Governments. Most of the funds were transferred the last two weeks of June and, in some cases, as late as 29th June 2021. The Ministry received UGX.2.86Bn for settlement of domestic arrears as part of the COVID 19 interventions, which was all absorbed and used to settle domestic arrears. The Ministry had outstanding domestic arrears of UGX.33Bn as at June 2021.          11 Ministry of Local Government 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
