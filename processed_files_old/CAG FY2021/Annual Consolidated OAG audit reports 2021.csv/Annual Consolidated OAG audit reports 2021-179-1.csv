;;; I noted that out of the 12 out-puts sampled for review, 6 (50%) were
;;;fully quantified, 5 (41%) were insufficiently quantified and 1 (9%) was
;;;not quantified at all making it impossible to measure performance. Out of
;;;the 6 out puts that were fully quantified, none was fully implemented, 4
;;;(66%) were partially implemented while 2 (34%) were not implemented.
;;; All the quarterly budget performance reports were submitted late by the
;;;Authority.
;;; I noted cases of delays in approval of MDA and LG strategic plans. In
;;;addition to this seventy three (73) entities had not submitted their
;;;strategic plans for review and certification by the Authority.
;;; The Authority had not undertaken capacity building of planners at both
;;;local and national level which affected the capacity of the planners to
;;;implement, monitor and report on the performance of the budgets in
;;;their respective entities.
;;; I observed shortcomings in government’s readiness to implement the
;;;"new programme approach to planning and budgeting which included;"
;;;non-alignment of the accounting and oversight processes to the new
;;;programme planning framework, non-alignment to the statistical and data
;;;collection systems to the new programme planning framework and non-
;;;functional programme working groups among others.
;;; I also noted that the Authority had not realigned the development
;;;planning regulations from the sector approach to planning and budgeting
;;;to the new programme approach of planning and budgeting.
       Although the Commission had come up with a strategic plan aligned to NDP III, this plan had not been approved and certified by NPA as required by the planning regulations. The Commission did collect NTR for the year despite having an NTR budget of UGX.2.7Bn. The Commission received 99% of its budget from Treasury and absorbed all the funds. Out of the thirteen out-puts assessed, two (2) outputs worth 0.88Bn were fully quantified, six (6) worth 6.72Bn were partially quantified while five (5) outputs worth 1.87Bn were not quantified at all. The two (2) out-puts that were quantified were all partially implemented. All the quarterly performance reports were submitted late by the Commission and there were no budget monitoring reports prepared by the Accounting Officer. The Commission does not participate in the recruitment of foreign service officers in Uganda’s missions and embassies abroad. The Commission had outstanding domestic arrears amounting to UGX.48.768,099. The Commission did not deduct PAYE from gratuity payments amounting to UGX.1Bn for its Commission members. 7 Public Service Commission 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
