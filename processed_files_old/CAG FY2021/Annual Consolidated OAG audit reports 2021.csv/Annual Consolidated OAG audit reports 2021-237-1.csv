      The Authority received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.50.43Bn, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by law. These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government. During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage management systems, power supply, street lights etc. The Parks have been characterized by encroachment, farming and cattle grazing, degradation of nearby swamps, unallocated land, idle land allocated to unserious investors and misunderstandings between investors and park management staff. Most roads are impassable and with inadequate lighting which exposes the parks to thefts and insecurity. I observed that some factories in the parks have set up their own infrastructure which may not be sustainable, and to the desired standards. This may negatively affect the usage and utilization of the parks. The Authority lacks regulations required under Section 38(1) of the Investment Code Act to operationalize the statute. This may hinder the smooth implementation of the Act which is meant to create an investment enabling environment. Although the Authority has 124 approved positions, only 78 (i.e. 62.9%) are filled, leaving 46 (37.1%) vacant positions. Among the vacant positions include 24 unfilled positions that are from the core Directorate of Investment which is the backbone of UIA. Understaffing undermines service delivery.
