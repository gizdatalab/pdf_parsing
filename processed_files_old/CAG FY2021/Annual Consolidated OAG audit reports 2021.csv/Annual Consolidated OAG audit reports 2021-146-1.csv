"       Out of seven (7) strategic targets to be achieved by 30th June 2021, none had been fully achieved, two (2) were partially achieved while five (5) were not achieved at all. The Project budgeted to receive IFAD funds to a tune of UGX.39.87bn, out of which UGX.25.584bn was available representing a performance of 64% of the budget. Further, there was a shortfall in GoU releases amounting to UGX.0.035Bn representing 0.46% of the budgeted UGX.7.597Bn. Out of the total available funding of UGX.35.528Bn during the financial year, UGX.28.415Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.7.113Bn representing an absorption level of 80%. I sampled Six (6) outputs with a total of eighty one (81) activities and expenditure of UGX.21.6231Bn and noted that all six (6) outputs with 81 activities were fully quantified to enable assessment of performance. Further, assessment of the implementation of all Six (6) outputs revealed that; all six (6) outputs with eighty one (81) activities were partially implemented i.e. out of the eighty one (81) activities, thirty two (32) activities (40%) were fully implemented; thirty (30) activities (37.5%) were partially implemented, while nineteen (19) activities (12.5%) remained unimplemented. Two (2) contracts worth UGX.12.397Bn in relation to construction of landing sites were cancelled due to delayed implementation of projects beyond 12 months from the initial intended completion date. I noted delayed titling of 883.92 hectares of the acquired nucleus estate Land exposing it to risks of encroachment by individuals. Review of four (4) sample procurements worth UGX.1.47Bn revealed an average delay of 140 days in the procurement process majorly as a result of delayed approval process by IFAD, contracts committee and Solicitor General. 7 National Oil Palm Project 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
