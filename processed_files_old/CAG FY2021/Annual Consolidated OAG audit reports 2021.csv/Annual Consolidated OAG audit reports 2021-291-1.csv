        I noted that the Company had no approved strategic plan that is aligned to NDPIII at the time of audit. I noted that although the Company realized 101% of the budgeted, the original budget was revised from UGX.6.07Bn to UGX.2.63bn to match the expected revenue. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.2.66bn, UGX. 1.36 Bn was resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.1.3bn representing an absorption level of 51%. I noted that the Stadium quantified all its five (5) outputs and all the outputs were partially implemented whereby out of forty four (44) activities, the entity fully implemented seven (7) activities (16%), partially implemented five (5) activities (11%), while thirty two (32) activities (73%) remained unimplemented. I noted that MNSL liabilities remained on a higher side despite a registered decrease in the F/Y 2019/2020 to UGX.3.89Bn as at the end of the financial year under review representing a reduction of UGX.1.49 (28%). from UGX.5.38Bn I noted that Mandela National stadium closed the financial year with a receivables figure of UGX.2.42Bn, a reduction of only 7% from receivables of UGX.2.59 as at the end of the previous FYR: 2019/2020. I noted that the Company did not implement its Staffing Strategy of the current running strategic plan 2018-2023. I noted that stadium Land continues to have illegal occupants.
