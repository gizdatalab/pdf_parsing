An assessment to establish if there has been service delivery from a sample of outputs that were implemented revealed that purchase of motor vehicles and other transport equipment was undertaken but not fully used for the purpose while the Commission continues to pay rent after fully acquiring warehousing space. I noted inconsistencies in the reported performance where all vehicles were reported as received which was not true while reported balances in the financial statements were inconsistent with those reported in the performance reports. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX.4,023,217,397 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I noted that the Commission has been accumulating arrears in past three years and during the year 2020/2021, UGX.6.959Bn in arrears remained outstanding. The Commission has in the past won cases and was awarded costs to the tune of UGX.336,880,920 but management has not collected these receivables. The Commission procured Biometric Voter Verification Kit and services for the 2021 general election at a cost of UGX.82,894,881,252 and I observed that available kits were not considered while the services were not fully delivered. The Commission entered into two contract agreements with a company to supply 10 double cabin pick-up vehicles at a cost of UGX.1,564,563,350 and 40 double cabin pick-up vehicles at UGX.7,013,387,920 for nomination of the Presidential candidates but by the time of audit, whereas the Commission had paid the full amount, only 32 double cabin vehicles out of the total 50 vehicles procured had been delivered leaving a balance of 18 vehicles. The Commission procured for printing of ballot papers for 2021 general elections at a total cost of UGX.83.855Bn. 248 out of expected 448 pallets were delivered but the Commission had assembled vehicles to carry the entire load which rendered the vehicles redundant and this caused a loss to the Commission in form of hire fees, fuel and allowances. The Commission was required to vacate their current premises by 30th June, 2021 and was subsequently compensated with UGX.22.14Bn by the Uganda National Roads Authority which was transferred to the consolidated fund as non-tax revenue. As a result of the continued delay to implement this critical activity of finding a new home, the Commission is already incurring losses on property acquired and is also likely to cause government to incur litigation costs through UNRA’s failure to completely hand over the construction sites for roads to the contractor. The Commission contracted two law firms for provision of legal services for Presidential petition at a cost of UGX.3,748,550,000 which had been budgeted at UGX.800Million resulting into payment of UGX.2,948,550,000 over and above the budget. Even though the planning for the elections started 3 years back, the procurement was treated as an emergency and there was no basis for the fees charged or detail of how the Commission came up with the market price for the service.          ;;
