shall not exceed 3% of the total approved budget for that financial year, without the approval of Parliament. It was established that during the financial year ended 30 th June 2021, supplementary funding totalling UGX.6.13Tn was granted by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. It was, however, noted that the source of the funding for the supplementary expenditure was not clearly shown before approval was granted. As a result, the supplementary expenditure was instead financed by internal budget cuts from various votes thus affecting implementation of plans/ activities by the affected votes. I noted that, although the budget was increased to UGX.51.625Tn, it was only funded to the tune of UGX.46.6Tn (90%funding). approval of supplementary budgets without a corresponding increase in revenue/financing could be attributed to fiscal indiscipline which leads to increased funding gap affecting the earlier budget objectives and plans. Secretary to Treasury responded that for the Financial Year 2022/23, the Ministry of Finance was using zero based budgeting approach to prioritize critical activities and expenditures to avoid supplementary requests during execution.
