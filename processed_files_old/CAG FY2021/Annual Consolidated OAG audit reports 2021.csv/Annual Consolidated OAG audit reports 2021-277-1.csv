    I noted that the University did not have the strategic plan annualized to indicate which outputs are expected for each year of implementation of the plan covering the period of 2021/21-2024/25. I also noted that whereas the University had prepared and submitted its strategic plan to NPA for approval, it had not yet been approved at the time of audit in October 2021. I reviewed the NTR estimates, revenue sources and rates charged at vote level for the financial year 2021/2021 and noted that the University budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.95.84Bn during the year under review. Out of this, only UGX.58.29Bn was collected, representing a performance of 60.82% of the target. I further noted that the University budgeted to receive UGX.363.74Bn out of which UGX.359.86Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.3.88Bn which is 1.1% of the budget. Revenue shortfalls affect implementation of the planned activities. Out of the total warrants of UGX.359.86Bn received during the financial year, UGX.357.04Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.2.82Bn representing an absorption level of 99.2%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by PFMA. I noted that the University received off-budget financing to the tune of UGX.237,398,885,878 which was not declared to Treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. These funds were received directly from both development partners and other stakeholders for undertaking activities not budgeted for.  I reviewed the extent of quantification of outputs and activities for a 12 Makerere University. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
