;;;of UGX 86Bn. Domestic energy sales were 9.5 % below budget. Both
;;;sales to Rwanda and DRC 29% below the budget, and no sales were
;;;made to South Sudan despite the anticipated revenue of UGX.824 million.
;;; UETCL budgeted to receive from Government, UGX.108.823Bn for
;;;capacity charges and deemed energy costs. However, only UGX 36.4Bn
;;;was released resulting in a shortfall of UGX 72.423Bn, which is 66% of
;;;the budget.
;;; I sampled 40 critical activities implemented under 7 sampled departments
;;;under UETCL and noted that 17(43%) tasks had been fully implemented,
;;;13 (32%) were partially implemented, while 10 (25%) were not
;;;implemented at all.
;;; A provision for bad and doubtful debts amounting to UGX 161.4bn was
;;;made under Trade and other receivables in the financial statements. This
;;;was an increment of 25% from the financial year 2019/20. The provision
;;;relates to customers with unpaid balances in contravention of the terms
;;;and conditions of the power sales agreement. I further noted that 74.7%
;;;of the provisions were attributable to only one Company.
;;; Analysis of the trade and other payables revealed an increment of 18.7Bn
;;;from UGX.740.8Bn in 2019/20. Included in these payables were amounts
;;;of UGX.71.2Bn and USD.4.7 million which have been outstanding for over
;;;10 years.
;;; M/s UMEME and M/s UEDCL withheld UETCL revenue of UGX 64Bn and
;;;10.31Bn, respectively on account of evacuation losses and non-payment
;;;of electricity bills by Government MDAs. Withholding revenue constrains
;;;UETCL’s ability to pay electricity generators.
;;; The land titling process was not satisfactory on most of UETCL Projects.
;;;UETCL takes an average of 3 years to conclude the titling process in
;;;contravention of the 6 months period warranted which exposes the
;;;company to a risk of litigation and potential encroachment.
;;; UETCL incurred deemed energy costs of UGX 87.7Bn on thirteen (13)
;;;PPAs, save for me HPP were directly financed through the tariff system,
;;;hence impacting on the electricity price to the final consumer.
;;; I noted that UETCL incurred about UGX 494,150,000 in replacing
;;;vandalized tower equipment during the year under review. I further noted
;;;that the company incurred UGX. 1.6Bn in replacement costs on assorted
;;;transmission line items vandalized between 2017 and 2021.
;;; I noted delays in concluding the procurement process for a sample of
;;;procurements with a total contract sum of UGX.17.8Bn with
;;;procurements lasting an average of 3 years and some cases going up to 5
;;;years. Prolonged procurement processes deny timely achievement of
;;;intended project objectives.
   Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.3.71Bn, UGX.3.71Bn was utilized. This represents an absorption level of 100%. I noted that the Company failed to maintain National Strategic Reserves. In the period under review, the Consortium failed to meet the required National Strategic Reserve levels of 12 million litres per month. Failure to restock petroleum reserves exposes the Country to supply shocks and a risk of inflated prices in the event of disruptions in the petroleum supplies chain. I noted that as at 30th June 2021, the consortium had not developed the facilities to enable lake transport to the Jinja Storage Tanks.
