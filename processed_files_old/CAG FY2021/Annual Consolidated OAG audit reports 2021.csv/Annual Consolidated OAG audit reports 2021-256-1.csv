The College does not have an approved strategic plan for the period 2021-202 and lacks an enabling law that stipulates its mandate. There is a risk that activities implemented during the financial year 2020/2021 were not aligned to the NDP-III, which negatively affects the achievement of the National Development objectives Out of the total receipts of UGX 2,753,839,117 for the financial year, UGX 2,911,962,444 was spent resulting into an over expenditure of UGX 158,123,327 representing an absorption level of 106%. The over absorption of funds was due to the opening balances for civil works executed even during the Covid-19 lockdown. I noted a decline in students’ enrolment from 431 students in 2016/17 to 256 students in 2020/21. Continued fall in enrolment may result in the College’s failure to achieve its mandate of producing technical human resource in forestry and related natural resources through training.   Unqualified 11 Nyabyeya Forestry College (NFC)  Opinion;;;
