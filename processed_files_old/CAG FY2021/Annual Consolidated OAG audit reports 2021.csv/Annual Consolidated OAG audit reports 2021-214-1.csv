"        I noted that the entity had prepared a strategic plan. However, this had not been approved by NPA at the end of the year under review. URF did not forecast the NTR to be collected during the year. However, the Fund collected a total of UGX7,078,800 during the year. Out of the total warrants of UGX. 506.507bn received during the financial year, UGX. 506.296 Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX. 0.211Bn representing an absorption level of 99.96%. The unspent funds were swept back to the consolidated fund as required by the PFMA The Authority did not implement some of its planned activities during the year. Examples include: Production of quarterly reports on the status and functionality of District Road Committees; Recruitment and substantive appointment of staff and; Review and calibration of the funds allocation formula. The Fund did not collect the funds provided for under section 21 of the URF Act 2008 which mandates the Fund on recommendation by the URF Board to charge road user charges which include fuel levies, international transit fees from vehicles entering the country, road license fees, axle load fees, and bridge and road toll fees. I noted that the fund allocation formula was last reviewed by the Secretariat in 2019. In addition, during the year, the formula was not reviewed to provide for current situations such as budget cuts and Covid- 19 pandemic effects which led to disproportionate transfers to designated agencies. Procurements worth UGX 642,234,236 had delays ranging between 1 and 93 working days. For example; the contract for provision of Motor Vehicle maintenance services under framework contract was delayed by 93 days and the contract for supply, delivery and installation of I-pads for URF Board members was delayed by 15 days. There were inadequate monitoring Designated Agencies. Out of the 203 designated agencies supposed to be monitored, only twenty-seven (27) Agencies representing 13.3% of the total designated agencies and sub 3 Uganda Road Fund. Unqualified Opinion";;;
