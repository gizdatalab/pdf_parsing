"         I noted that out of the budgeted revenue of UGX.20.53Bn for 2020/21; UGX.24.59Bn was collected, representing a performance of 120% of the target. Out of the 41 outputs assessed, 34 outputs representing 83% were fully implemented; four (4) outputs representing 10% were partially implemented, while three (3), representing 7%, were not implemented. I noted that there was no evidence that the Accounting Officer prepared or submitted the annual budget performance reports of the Council by 31st July 2021 as required by regulations. I noted that the entity did not prepare and submit the annual monitoring plans to the line Ministry for consolidation and onward transmission to the Ministry of Finance Economic and Economic Planning. I established that UGX.94Mn was directly paid to staff’s personal bank accounts, yet this money could have been directly paid to the intended final recipients. Out of the 85 planned activities assessed, 69 outputs/activities representing 81% were implemented; 9 outputs/activities representing 11% were partially implemented, while seven (7) outputs/activities representing 8% were not implemented at all. fully I noted that the Council did not produce the annual report as required by the UNCST Act. A review of the procurement file for the Supply of ICT Equipment under EDCTP-SCRECU Project revealed no evidence of any public bid opening session, which creates doubts as to whether the bidders attended the bid opening session. Audit noted that the Council had outstanding Pay As You Earn (PAYE) payments relating to UGX.45,457,013 as of 30th June 2021, which had not been remitted to Uganda Revenue Authority to July 2019 and June 2020 amounting Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. 2020/21 Unqualified 6 Opinion";;;
