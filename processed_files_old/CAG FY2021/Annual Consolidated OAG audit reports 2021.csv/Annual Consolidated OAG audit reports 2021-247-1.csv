;;;UGX.16.743Bn.
;;; I noted that the Ministry accrued domestic arrears worth UGX.242Mn
;;;during the financial year.
;;; I noted that a total of UGX.159,543,267 paid to service providers and
;;;advances to various staff was not adequately supported with
;;;accountabilities and supporting documents such as requisitions, receipts,
;;;activity reports, minutes of meetings.
;;; Payments amounting to UGX.73Mn were advanced to personal accounts
;;;of staff to make onward payments to suppliers for services like office
;;;internet, hotels, workshop related expenditure, among others.
;;; I noted that as of 30th June 2021, several compensations claim worth
;;;UGX.165Bn by some Cooperative Societies had not been verified. There
;;;was also no evidence that verification teams had been constituted to
;;;undertake the verification exercise.
;;; Examination of records revealed that for some Cooperatives, the amounts
;;;to be paid as compensation for war losses were in excess of the amounts
;;;originally claimed by the Cooperatives.
;;; I noted that payments amounting to UGX.14Bn were made to persons
;;;and law firms other than the beneficiary Cooperative Societies.
;;; review of the procurement processes revealed that, for eight (8)
;;;procurements valued at UGX.282,626,237, the estimated market prices
;;;approved by the Accounting Officer on Form 5, were the same as those
;;;quoted by the best-evaluated bidder and subsequently awarded. I
;;;observed that the evaluation committee and Contracts committees did
;;;not detect the questionable coincidence.
;;; The ministry acquired a lease on an already existing lease for land and
;;;subsequent loss of funds.
    The Beareau was unable to activate the use of the Digital Tracking System (DTS) to enforce conformity to standards of selected items and claim the associated fees due to absence of an enabling regulation to operationalise the Service. As a result, the Buereau was unable to claim for a total of UGX.13Bn charged on goods and services for conformity stamps issued by the provider towards conformity enforcement. There is a risk of misuse of the amounts involced by the private provider. The Bureau released 366 consignments without testing due to lack of capacity and another 633 consignments released due to the absence of standards to test these commodities for conformity. Lack of capacity may lead to the release of sub-standard products to the market. I noted that out of the approved staff structure of 666 positions, the Bureau had only filled 439, leaving a staffing gap of 227 (34 %). As a result, there was staff presence at only 27 out of the 170 border entry points. There is a risk of sub-standard goods entering the country through border points where the Bureau staffs are not present. It was noted that procurements to the tune of UGX.2.735Bn were not completed as of 30th June 2021. This was attributed to several reasons, including failure to attract competitive bidders for some procruements, delayed submission of clear specifications, especially for specialised equipment, late submissions/ initiations of procurement requisitions by the users, as well as delayed deliveries due to COVID-19 especially for specialised Equipment. Un implemented activities imply that the provision of critical government programs and associated services were delayed. 8 Uganda National Bureau of Standards. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
