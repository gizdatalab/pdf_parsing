;;;UGX.3.77Bn and observed that all the 4 outputs with a total of 7 activities
;;;and expenditure worth UGX.3.77Bn were fully quantified but were
;;;partially implemented.
;;; The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to
;;;MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly
;;;monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED
;;;contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20.
;;; The Mission submitted performance reports for all quarters after the
;;;deadline given for submission. I also observed that cumulative
;;;performance reports revealed that the subsequent quarterly performance
;;;reports did not include activities implemented in the previous quarter(s).
;;; Accumulated arrears of revenue to the tune of UGX.181,948,023 most of
;;;which related to the prior year remained uncollected.
;;; The Embassy paid a sum of USD.46,950 (equivalent to UGX.174,513,150)
;;;to Toyota Kenya Limited for the acquisition of a Land Cruiser Prado but
;;;the procurement was undertaken by the High Commissioner instead of
;;;the Accounting Officer which resulted into usurping the powers of the
;;;Accounting Officer, over committing the Mission, non-compliance with
;;;Government ban on acquisition of motor vehicles, un-planned
;;;procurement, use of inappropriate procurement method and failure to
;;;involve the Contracts Committee.
;;; The Embassy paid KES.3,360,000 (equivalent to UGX.117,633,600) in
;;;respect of education allowances direct to its officials instead of their
;;;respective education institutions or schools contrary to Section (E - e)
;;;Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.
;;; The Embassy spent KES.620,485 (equivalent to UGX.21,723,180)on
;;;refunds for medical expenses to its officers contrary to the requirements
;;;of Section M (m-a) (14) of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010.
;;; The Mission did not have a fixed assets register in the format prescribed
;;;in the Treasury Instructions and therefore additions and disposals to the
;;;assets could not be verified. I further observed that a number of the
;;;entity’s assets were old and due for boarding off exposing the assets to
;;;loss of value and high maintenance costs.
;;; The Mission has an approved staff structure of seven (7) staff positions
;;;out of which 5 (71.4%) were filled leaving 2 (28.5%) vacant.
     Out of the planned 6 (six) strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, 1 (one) was fully achieved while 2 (two) were partially achieved while three (3) were not achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.2.62Bn representing 0.0015% performance. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.4.554Bn, UGX.3.732Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.822Bn representing an absorption level of 81.9%. I sampled 3 outputs with a total of 6 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.732Bn and observed that all the 3 outputs were fully quantified and none was fully implemented. Funds to the tune of INR.42,262 (equivalent to UGX.2,062,385) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals.  The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to 25.
