;;;(94%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.10.885 Bn,
;;;resulting in an unabsorbed balance of UGX. 0.676 Million. The
;;;unabsorbed balance was subsequently swept back to the
;;;consolidated fund account
;;;
;;; I reviewed funds absorption and noted that UGX.19.4 billion
;;;(94%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.20.6 billion,
;;;resulting in an under absorption of UGX.1.2 billion. I further
;;;noted an unexplained under absorption of salaries funds totaling
;;;UGX. 235,934,838 and under absorption of pension and gratuity
;;;totaling UGX.930, 294,356.
;;;
;;; I noted that UGX.3, 339,798 was paid to 4 staff who had retired.
;;;These were payments for services not rendered to the District,
;;;resulting in loss of funds to Government.
;;;
;;; I further noted that loan deductions for a sample of 10
;;;employees lacked letters of undertaking and did not have
;;;evidence of consent.
;;;
;;; I also noted loan deductions for twenty-eight (28) staff, totaling
;;;UGX.33,119,091, were above the approved deduction amount
;;;and Loans for fifteen (15) staff totaling UGX.132,794,500 had
;;;unreasonable loan end-dates.
;;;
;;; I noted that the District did not submit quarterly returns on
;;;payroll to MoPS. This led to accumulations of arrears, under
;;;absorption of wage, pension and gratuity budget and delays in
;;;granting clearance to recruit.
;;;
;;; From a comparison of the payroll register and IFMS payment file,
;;;I noted that 5 staff were paid a total of UGX.7, 145,972 off the
;;;IPPS. This control weakness created an opportunity for payment
;;;of salaries to non-eligible persons
I noted that the wage and Pension Pay roll of UGX. 7,083,040,397 constituted 25% of the Municipal Council’s budget for 2020/2021 of 28.3Bn. I noted that the Municipal Council delayed to submit wage estimates to MoPs, as required. I reviewed funds absorption and noted that UGX.6.7 billion (98%) was spent out of the total receipts of UGX.6.9 billion for salaries, pension and gratuity I noted that whereas UGX.1,510,024,063 was deducted from employees’ salaries to be remitted to different beneficiaries, UGX.1,502,519,098 was remitted leading to an under remittance amounting to UGX.7,504,965 I noted that the entity did not include political leaders’ gratuity of UGX.8,939,400 in the computation of PAYE leading to under deduction of PAYE of UGX.2,681,820      16.
