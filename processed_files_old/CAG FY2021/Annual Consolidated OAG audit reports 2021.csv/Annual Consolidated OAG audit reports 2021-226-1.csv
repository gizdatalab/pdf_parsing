Out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.5.500Bn for the financial year 2019/2020 only UGX.5.480Bn was realized, representing a performance of 99.6 % above the target. The Ministry budgeted for UGX.74.32Bn in Government receipts, out of which UGX.71.13Bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX.3.19Bn which is 4.29% of the budget. Out of the total receipts of UGX.71.12Bn, UGX.69.13Bn was spent resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.1.99Bn representing an absorption level of 97.2%. The balance unspent was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund at the end of the financial year. I sampled 34 outputs with a total of 175 activities and expenditure of UGX 57.908Bn and noted that 15 outputs with a total of 67 activities and expenditure of UGX.12.45Bn were fully quantified. Fifteen (15) outputs with a total of 92 activities and expenditure worth UGX.42.35Bn were insufficiently quantified. Four (4) outputs with a total of 16 activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.11Bn were not quantified. I assessed the implementation of 15 fully quantified outputs with a sample of 67 activities worth UGX.12.45Bn and noted that three (3) outputs with a total of three (3) activities worth UGX.0.456 Bn were fully implemented. Twelve (12) outputs with a total of sixty-four (64) activities worth UGX.11.99Bn were partially implemented. I noted that the Ministry’s Payables amount increased by UGX.105,145,022,390 from UGX.144,329,975,873 in the previous year to UGX.249,474,998,263 addition, UGX.11,593,918,200 of the new compensations related to private persons that had been included among the ranchers to be compensated, but lacked ranch title number, area of land lost and other details recorded in the domestic arrears schedule. in the current year. In I noted a recognized NTR amount of UGX.1.7billion relating to proceeds from the sale of government pool housed had no proper documentation. I noted that Parliament approved a payment of UGX.3,802,500,000, as compensation for Ndeeba Land but the payment was halted by an interim court order. I noted that the Ministry compensated the claimant of land at Block 237 plots 29,48,56,59 and 67 at Mutungo for a sum of UGX.26.4 Bn which had earlier been purchased by Uganda Land Commission which partly paid UGX 2.4Bn. The two entities have not agreed on the ownership of the land.          2 Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
