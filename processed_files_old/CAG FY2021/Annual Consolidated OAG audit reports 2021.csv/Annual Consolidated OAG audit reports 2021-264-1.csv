Out of the total receipts for the financial year of USD 790,580.38, only USD. 239,221.92 was spent by the Programme resulting in an unspent balance of USD 551,358.46, representing an absorption level of 30.2%. Under absorption of released funds results in non-implementation of planned activities. I noted that the Planned Programme activities such as Development of Reservoir Modelling and Simulation, Review of the Tax Laws and the Model Production Sharing Agreement Training course for Component Managers and Program Secretariat among others were not implemented. There is a risk of failure to achieve intended Programme objectives and service delivery due to delayed implementation of activities.   13 Strengthening the Management of Oil and Gas Programme (SMOGP) 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
