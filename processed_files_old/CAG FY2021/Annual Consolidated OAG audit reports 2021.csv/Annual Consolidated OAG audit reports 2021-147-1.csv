"      Out of the planned six (6) strategic targets/goals to be achieved by 30th June 2021, one (1) target was fully achieved, three (3) targets had been partially achieved and two (2) were not achieved at all. The Project budgeted to receive UGX.1.184bn out of which UGX.1.049bn was received resulting into a shortfall of UGX.0.135bn, which is 11% of the budget. Further, out of the total warrants of UGX.1.049Bn received during the financial year, only UGX.0.199Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.85Bn representing absorption level of 19%. I sampled five (5) outputs with 15 activities worth UGX.0.199Bn and noted that three (3) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.0.199Bn were fully quantified; Two (2) outputs with a total of eight (8) activities were not quantified at all. Further, of the three quantified outputs assessed, one (1) output with 3 activities worth UGX.199, 045,000 was partially implemented. Out of the 3 activities, one (1) activity was partially implemented, while two (2) activities remained unimplemented. Two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth NIL expenditure were not implemented. AGRA amended the disbursement of Grant due to low absorption and decided to de-obligate US$.571,167 being the total un-disbursed funds for the project thus necessity to restructure the budget and milestone delivery plan to fit within US$.323, 450 that had been disbursed. Contrary to the grant guidelines, unspent or un-committed grant funds remained on the project bank account and were not invested in highly liquid investments to earn income. A number of project milestones had not been achieved by the end of the financial year exposing the Grant to a risk of failure to achieve its objectives. 9 Strengthening National Seed Certification Service Project (SNSCS). 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion";;;
