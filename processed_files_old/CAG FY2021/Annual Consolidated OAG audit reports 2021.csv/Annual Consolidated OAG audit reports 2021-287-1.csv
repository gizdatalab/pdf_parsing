of which UGX.6.65bn was warranted, resulting in a shortfall of UGX. 1.85bn representing 21% of the budget. I noted that the Institute spent all the funds that was available amounting to UGX.6.92bn representing 100% performance. I noted that Seven (7) outputs with fifteen (15) activities and expenditure worth UGX.4Bn were fully quantified. That is, 100% of the activities within these out-puts were clearly quantified to enable assessment of performance. I further noted that Twelve (12) outputs with Twenty two (22) activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.49Bn was not quantified to enable assessment of performance. Out of the Seven (7) quantified outputs three (3) outputs with seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX 4.39Bn were fully implemented while two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX.0.25Bn were partially implemented as two (2) outputs with four (4) activities worth UGX0.33Bn were not implemented. That is none of the four (4) activities was implemented at all. The Institute had accumulated domestic arrears totalling to UGX. UGX.1.03Bn by the closure of the financial year under review (2020/2021) thereby being expressed to risk of litigation. The Institute had outstanding receivables totalling to UGX.0.055Bn by the closure of the financial year under review. Construction of Female hostel block, 2 Lecture halls, Library and an information Centre and Health Centre had delayed by 20months from the initial completion date of 27th March, 2020. Out of the 103 approved staff established of the Institute, only 84 posts had been filled leaving 19 (18%) positions vacancies. I further noted that in spite of the vacant positions, the Institute had recruited an additional Forty-six (46) staff on contract terms outside the approved structure.       ;;;
