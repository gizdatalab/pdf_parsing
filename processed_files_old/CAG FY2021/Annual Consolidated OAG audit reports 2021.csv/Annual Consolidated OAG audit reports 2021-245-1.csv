I noted that the entity did not budget for any tax revenue despite collecting 84 million. Failure to budget for NTR conceals the entity’s potential collect revenue and also complicates assessment of performance since there is no benchmark. I noted that out of the budgeted revenue of UGX. 8.899Bn from the Central Government for 2020/2021, and only UGX. 8.035Bn was received, representing a performance of only 90 % of the release. The entity had a cash balance brought forward of UGX.134,172,095 from FY 2019/2020 and received UGX.8,035,212,980 making total cash available for spending in FY 20/21 of UGX.8,169,385,075. Out of the total cash available to spend, only UGX.3,730,897,866 was actually spent by the entity, representing an absorption level of 46%. This resulted into a balance of UGX.4,438,487,209 (54%) as unspent funds. I compared the consolidated procurement plan, monthly procurement reports and procurement files availed and established that a number of procurements worth UGX.2,621,000,000 were not completed as of 30th June 2021.

I also noted that the Chairperson of the meeting did not sign the minutes for the meeting. I noted that the Board had not developed some governance policies, manuals and other documents that would help in the smooth running of The Uganda Warehouse Receipt System Authority had an approved budget of UGX.8,904,499,400 for the year. A review of the entity’s receipts, cashbook and bank statement for the period ending 30th June 2021 revealed that UGX.8,035,212,980 was received under the normal budget appropriation  Whereas the overall Government National Development Plan (NDP II1) 2020/2021-2024/2025 was commissioned in the year under review, UWRSA had no approved strategic plan for the period under review 4 Uganda Warehouse Receipt System Authority (UWRSA) 2020/21 Unqualified         Opinion;;;
