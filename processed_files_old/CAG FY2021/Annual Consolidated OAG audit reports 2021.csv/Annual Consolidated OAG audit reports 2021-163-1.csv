      The Ministry of Internal Affairs prepared a strategic plan for 2020-2025. However, it had not been approved by the National Planning Authority at the time of audit. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.51.5Bn, only UGX.50.8Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.7Bn representing an absorption level of 99%. I sampled forty-one (41) outputs with a total of one hundred and ninety- seven (197) activities and expenditure of UGX.37.7Bn for assessment and noted that fifty-nine (59) activities with expenditure worth UGX.11.30Bn were fully quantified. one hundred thirty-seven (137) activities with worth UGX.26.1Bn were insufficiently quantified, and one (1) activity with expenditure worth UGX.0.24Bn was not quantified at all An assessment of service delivery revealed that in the financial year 2020/2021, the Ministry extended support to 299 victims of human trafficking, which is only 45% of the total victims of human trafficking as reported by the Uganda Police Force. An assessment of the Monitoring of NGOs revealed that although the Ministry had registered 2,249 NGOs, the Ministry could only carry out offsite inspections of just 145 NGOs or 1% of all registered NGOs. A trend analysis of the Ministry domestic arrears over the past three years showed an increasing trend from UGX.0.078Bn in 2018/2019 to UGX.1.45Bn in 2020/2021. The Ministry paid for repair services worth UGX.13,237,877 without being certified by the responsible technical officer to confirm receipt of the services. The Ministry also procured stores worth UGX.88,444,071, which were not recorded in the Ministry’s stores records.  I noted that procurements worth UGX.88,844,071 were not recorded in 14 The Ministry of Internal Affairs. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
