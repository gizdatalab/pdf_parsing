"13. MITOOMA DLG Opinion Unqualified          I noted that roll of UGX.18,505,405,927 constituted 63% of the District’s budget for 2020/2021 of UGX.29,350,754,495. the wage and Pension Pay I noted that the District did not to submit wage estimates to MoPS, as required I noted delays in the remittance of PAYE deductions to URA of up to 100 days I noted that 47 newly recruited/transferred employees delayed to access payroll, with delays ranging between 2-14 months I noted that 7 pensioners delayed to access the pension payroll, with delays ranging between 1-14 months I noted that the District did not prepare monthly wage, pension and gratuity performance analysis and thus did not submit quarterly returns on payroll to MoPS I noted that 6 pensioners were paid a total of UGX.26,607,195 off the IPPS I observed that there were variances of UGX.514,103,048 between the figures in the MoPS IPPS and entity payroll registers,  Operational challenges were encountered; E.g. Un-reliable network in Mitooma where HR staff had to physically travel to the neighbouring Bushenyi District to be able to download documents such as pension payroll registers. I noted that the upgrade of Mayanga HC II to HC III contracted to Khalsa (U) Ltd was still under construction and only at roofing stage by the time of audit inspection on 13th October, 2021. However, the medical equipment had already been procured and delivered under a separate contract to M/s Rodrisa Supplies Limited who was expected to supply, deliver, instal, train and commission the medical equipment. Procurement of medical equipment for a health facility still at foundation stage may lead to obsolescence, pilferage and physical damage leading to nugatory expenditure.";;;
