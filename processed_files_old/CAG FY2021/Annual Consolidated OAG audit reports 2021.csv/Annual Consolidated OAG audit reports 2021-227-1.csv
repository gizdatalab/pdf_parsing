Revenue shortfall limits the implementation of planned activities which could affect the achievement of the project objectives. Review of the Q4 Progress report revealed that many sub-projects worth USD 27.5million handed over to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development for construction, will not be implemented due to lack of funding, yet, costs have already been incurred since all the sub- projects have been designed and Environment and Social Impact Assessment done. The civil works for construction of three markets, namely: Biiso Market in Buliisa District, Kabaale Market in Hoima District and Buhuka Market in Kikuube District costed at UGX.9,963,228,048 were not complete despite the extension of the completion date to 31st August 2021, thus delaying service delivery to citizens. 4 Albertine Region Sustainable Development Project (ARSDP) – MoLHUD 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
