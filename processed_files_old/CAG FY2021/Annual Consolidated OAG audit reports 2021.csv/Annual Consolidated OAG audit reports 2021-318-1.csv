;;;reflected as Plot 27 instead of 2F on the cover page of the title deed for
;;;the land currently occupied by Nakasero Blood Bank. Management wrote

;;;dated 5/4/2012 Reference number UBTS/ADM/LT/01, no response had

;;;Bank were reported to have been encroached on by the fence of Pearl of

;;;(Terrain Consult) who had been appointed by UBTS.
;;; I noted a one year’s delayed execution of works for the completion of the
;;;remodelling of a store at Nakasero Blood Bank. A sum of UGX 2.86bn had
;;;so far been paid against the contract sum of UGX.3.77bn.
;;; I noted that a total of UGX.0.968Bn was spent on the Blood Safety
;;;Information System during the year. Whereas there was information on
;;;blood collected, stored and issued during the year, there was no
;;;information on how the 224,303 units of blood that had been issued to
;;;the different health facilities had been utilized.
I noted that the entity had prepared and approved its plan. However, approval and certification had not yet been obtained from the National Planning Authority. I noted that the entity did not budget or collect NTR during the year under review. This was attributed to the breakdown of the Nitrogen plant three years ago which was the main source of revenue. However, the Institute received funds from GoU and was in the process of procuring a new Nitrogen plant. The Institute received the entire budget of UGX.8.97bn out of which UGX.8.95bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.20.76m (representing an absorption level of 98.8%). The unspent balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to the consolidated fund account. Two (2) outputs with a total of two (2) activities and expenditure of UGX 2.23bn were fully quantified out of the eight (8) outputs with a total of twenty-two (22) activities and expenditure of UGX 8.20bn sampled for assessment. None of the two (2) quantified activities under the two (2) outputs was implemented at all. Two (2) outputs with a total of seven (7) activities and expenditure worth UGX.4.99Bn were insufficiently quantified. Out of the seven (7) activities, two (2) activities (29%) was quantified, while the balance of five (5) activities (71%) were not clearly quantified to enable the assessment of performance. Four (4) outputs with a total of thirteen (13) activities and expenditure worth UGX 980m were not quantified at all. That is none of the thirteen (13) activities within these outputs was quantified at all. I noted that funds to the tune of UGX 53,300,000 were irregularly reallocated from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. I noted that the entity submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 after the prescribed deadline.          22 Uganda Virus Research Institute. Unqualified Opinion;;;
