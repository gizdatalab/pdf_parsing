      A total of six (6) strategic outputs (50%) were fully achieved, while 6 outputs were partially achieved and still on-going (50%). Out of the approved budgeted revenue of USD 1,887,374, USD 603,588.93 was released representing performance of 32% of the target. The project had a total available balance of USD 2,767,452.2, out of which USD 2,754,945.85 (99.5%) was spent leading to an unspent balance of only USD 12,506.35. All the 10 planned outputs with 39 activities and a total budget of USD 3,119,412.9 were properly quantified to enable measurement of performance. Out of the 39 planned activities under the 3 Project components, 19 (48.7%) were fully implemented, 10 (25.6 %) were partially implemented and 10 (25.6%) were not implemented at all. I noted delays in construction of infrastructure projects resulting from the effects of the Covid pandemic and effects of the rising water level of Lakes Albert and Edward and inadequate GoU funding. The projects affected included the construction of the surveillance station, Kitebere Landing Site, Mbegu landing site, fish processing facility at Dei Landing site, and supply of a fisheries research vessel. 23 Albert Multinational Lakes Edward and Integrated Fisheries Water Resources Management Project (LEAF) II 2020/21 and Unqualified Opinion;;;
