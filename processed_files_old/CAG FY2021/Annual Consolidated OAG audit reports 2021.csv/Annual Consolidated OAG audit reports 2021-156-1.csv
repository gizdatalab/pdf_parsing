 submitted during the month of January 2021, implying that the funds had not been accounted for by 30th June 2020. I noted from the review of financial statements that management did not disclose the outstanding balances as at 30th June 2019. Consequently, no provision was made to cater for domestic arrears in the financial year 2019/2020 budget. But I noted that UGX.9,145,799 was spent to settle outstanding bills in respect of conference facilities for JLOS and the supply and delivery of law reference books;;;

        I noted that the Commission did not have an approved strategic plan that was aligned to NDP III by the time of audit. The draft plan prepared by the entity had not been certified by NPA. The Commission collected over 100% of its NTR target for the year over and above the target. The Commission absorbed only 86.8% of the funds that were released by government. The Commission received off-budget financing directly from development partners to a tune of UGX.2.187Bn, which was not declared to Treasury and, therefore, not appropriated to the entity by Parliament. Management did not quantify 2 outputs with 6 activities and expenditure worth UGX 0.12Bn. Out of (11) outputs that were fully quantified with 22 activities, 3 activities worth UGX.0.44Bn were fully implemented, 18 activities worth UGX.15.54Bn were partially implemented. 1 output with 1 activity worth UGX.0.17Bn was not implemented at all. The Commission neither prepared annual budget monitoring plans nor submitted quarterly budget monitoring reports. The Commission also failed to submit all its quarterly budget performance reports in time. The UHRC had tribunal case backlog of 1,756 cases at the beginning of the financial year 2020/2021, and 71 additional cases were registered during the year, resulting in a total of 1,827 outstanding cases. Out of the 1,827 cases, only 326 (17.8%) were investigated and disposed of. The 4 Uganda Human Commission 2020/21 Rights Unqualified Opinion;;;
