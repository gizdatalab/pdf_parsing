;Hospital.;;review, and UGX. 451m was realized, representing a performance of
;Unqualified Opinion;;100.4% of the target. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX 11.723 bn, UGX. 11.385Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.337Bn (representing an absorption level of 97.1%). The unspent 
;;;balance at the end of the financial year was subsequently swept back to
;;;the consolidated fund account.
;;; I noted that all the eight (8) outputs selected for budget performance
;;;assessment with a total of eleven (11) activities and actual expenditure of
;;;UGX 4.6bn were fully quantified. This therefore enabled me to assess the
;;;Hospital’s performance during the year under review.
;;; Out of the eight (8) sampled outputs, two (2) outputs were fully
;;;implemented while six (6) were partially implemented. I further noted
;;;that out of the planned eleven (11) activities under the sampled outputs,
;;;two (2) activities were fully achieved while nine (9) were partially
;;;achieved.
;;; A total of UGX 36,870,179 worth of expenditure was charged on other
;;;than the budget lines on which the funds were appropriated without
;;;seeking the necessary approval from the relevant authorities.
;;; I noted that the Hospital submitted all the quarterly performance reports
;;;beyond the prescribed deadlines.
;;; From my review of the annual performance reports and physical
;;;inspections/verification of outputs reported, I did not observe
;;;inconsistencies in the reported performance.
;;; I noted that the Hospital accumulated payables/domestic arrears to tune
;;;of UGX. 799,186,746 up from UGX. 365,151,250 as at 30th June 2020.
;;; I noted that whereas the Board of Survey Report for the year ended 30th
;;;June 2021 established that the Hospital had a closing inventory of various
;;;"items; this state of affairs was not disclosed as part of the Financial"
;;;Statements under Annex (ii)-Schedule of Inventory, thereby rendering
;;;the financial statements incomplete.
;;; It was noted that the Hospital stored expired medicines without disposing
;;;them as required by the law. Out of the seventy four (74) items of
;;;expired drugs, I observed that thirty six (36) had expired by end of
;;;December 2020 (representing 49%). Under the circumstances, lives of
;;;patients are threatened by the existence of expired medicines at the
;;;hospital premises.
;;; I noted that the Referral Hospital was heavily congested with patients
;;;crowded in the wards and some sleeping on the floors. This was further
;;;evidenced by the data collected on Bed Occupancy Rates which showed
;;;an average BOR of 113% for the year under review. Congestion was also
;;;observed in the stores where some items were placed directly on the
;;;floor exposing them to damage.
;;; From a review of payments and procurements made during the year, I
;;;noted that procurements of goods worth UGX 187,406,417 were not
;;;supported with ledgers in the stores to track delivery and utilization of the
;;;accountable inventories procured.
 I noted that the Hospital’s 5-Year Strategic Plan (FY 2020/21-2024/25) had been approved by National Planning Authority (NPA) by the time of audit.  The entity budgeted to collect NTR of UGX. 1,520,000,000 during the 16 Kiruddu National Referral Hospital. Unqualified Opinion;;;
