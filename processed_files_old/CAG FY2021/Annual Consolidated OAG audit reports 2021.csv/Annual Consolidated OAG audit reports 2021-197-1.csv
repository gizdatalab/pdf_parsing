;;;year and remains unrecovered.

;;;of the financial year 2019/2020 revealed that additions during the year
;;;relating to non-residential buildings were disclosed as UGX.465,161,335,
;;;however, the Embassy procured items amounting to GBP.107,661
;;;(equivalent to UGX.494,777,699) implying that items worth
;;;UGX.29,616,364 were not disclosed in this statement thus understating
;;;the Statement of Stores and Other Assets (physical assets).
;;; The Embassy had a capital expenditure budget of UGX.275,000,000 but
;;;items worth UGX.494,777,699 were procured resulting into an over
;;;expenditure of UGX.224,777,699.
;;; The Embassy paid GBP.28,187.49 (equivalent UGX.129,541,258) in

      Out of the planned 5 strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, all the 5 were partially achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.3.14Bn representing 0% performance. Out of the total receipts of UGX.3.78Bn, UGX.2.87Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.91Bn representing an absorption level of 76%. I sampled 3 outputs with a total of 6 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.2.87Bn and observed that all the 3 outputs with a total of 6 activities and expenditure worth UGX.2.87Bn were not quantified at all. I was therefore unable to assess the implementation of outputs/activities of the Mission. Funds to the tune of UGX.16,835,000 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20.  The Mission submitted performance reports for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 after 21.
