9;Uganda Corporation (UDC). 2020/21 Development;;Out of the total funds received of UGX.137.27Bn only UGX.63.39Bn was spent by the entity during the year, resulting into an unspent balance of UGX.73.88Bn representing an absorption level of only 46%. I noted that 
;;;out of the 17 development project activities planned to be implemented
;Unqualified Opinion;;during the period under review, only (3) three development projects were fully implemented, while Five (5) development projects were partially
;;;implemented, Eleven (11) projects were not implemented at all. Failure to
;;;fully absorb funds by the Corporation, leads to non-achievement of
;;;development objectives.
;;; The UDC Act 2016 requires capitalisation of UDC to the tune of
;;;UGX.500Bn. The same Act also established an Industrial and Economic
;;;Development Fund which was to be run by the UDC. However, 5 years
;;;"later, the company has never been capitalised to that tune; currently the"
;;;capitalisation grants have accumulated to UGX.311Bn and the Industrial
;;;and Economic Development Fund has never been operationalized. The
;;;current funding model, is such that capitalisation grants over the years
;;;come assigned to specific projects which nullifies the investment appraisal
;;;process of UDC. This has the disadvantage of earmarking funds for
;;;investments that are not ready or even viable leading to the low
;;;absorption noted above.
;;; An amount of UGX.30.46Bn was invested in various companies by UDC
;;;during the year without valuation. Shareholding in these companies had
;;;not been secured by the time of reporting. There is a risk of loss of value.
;;; Although the UDC Act 2016 provides that the Corporation will take over
;;;the interest of government in seven entities specified in schedule 2 and to
;;;manage, promote and facilitate the interest of the government in those
;;;entities, 5 years later, this had not been done except for Nile Hotel
;;;Limited. The other entities include: Amber House Limited, Embassy
;;;House, Development House, Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort, Phoenix
;;;Logistics and Tri-Star Apparels Limited. There is a risk of loss of strategic
;;;direction and government may not be aware whether the national
;;;objectives of import substitution, employment and industrialization are
;;;being met by these entities.
The Authority received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.50.43Bn, which was not transferred to the consolidated fund as required by law. These funds were received directly from development partners to the EPC contractor for the Development of infrastructure at Kampala Industrial and Business Park, Namanve. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result into duplication of activities and is contrary to the Public finance Management Act 2015. The approved budget estimates for the Authority for the financial year 2020/2021 indicated that only UGX.22Mn out of UGX.2.411Bn was budgeted towards the settlement of domestic arrears. The arrears balance of UGX.2.389Bn was therefore not budgeted for settlement. Failure to provide resources for the accumulated arrears increases outstanding obligations. The Authority continued to accumulate domestic arrears with a total of UGX.1.768Bn incurred in the financial year under review, without clearing outstanding arrears from the previous financial year 2019/2020 of UGX.2.411Bn. The total accumulated domestic arrears stood at UGX.4.18Bn at 30th June 2021. This is an indicator of non adherence with the commitment control system of government.    During inspections countrywide, I observed that the industrial parks lack or had inadequate infrastructures like roads, solid waste and sewage 10 Investment  Uganda Authority. 2020/21 Unqualified Opinion;;;
