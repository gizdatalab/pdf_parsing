;;;DKK.37,500 (equivalent to UGX.21,112,500) while on interdiction.
;;;Payment of employment benefits to staff on interdiction may be unlawful.
;;; The Embassy continued to pay rent for the Finance Attaché’s residence
;;;from April 2020 to September 2020 amounting to DKK.133,800.00
;;;(equivalent to UGX.75,329,400), a period during which the residence was
;;;not occupied.
;;; The Embassy procured 64 items for use at the Chancery and Embassy
;;;staff residences involving a sum of DKK.433,707.00 (equivalent to
;;;UGX.244,177,283). The procurements were undertaken without
;;;adherence to the procurement procedures and were not adequately
;;;accounted for.
;;; Contrary to the provisions in the law, expenditure amounting to
;;;DKK.1,181,215.74 (equivalent to UGX.665,024,462) was irregularly
;;;incurred by the Embassy during the month of July out of the expired
;;;appropriation and before the first quarter release for the financial year
;;;2020/2021 was received.
;;; Prepayments amounting to DKK.566,960.83 (equivalent to
;;;UGX.319,198,947) were made to nine (9) suppliers for services including
;;;fuel, insurance, water, electricity and heating. The funds were paid
;;;before the services were received by the Embassy.
;;; Cash amounting to DKK.37,000 (equivalent to UGX.20,831,000) was
;;;irregularly withdrawn from the Mission’s corporate bank account by Amb.
;;;Elly Kamahungye Kafeero to pay for accounting work done by a non-
;;;member of staff living outside Copenhagen. The funds were re-deposited
;;;on the Embassy account on 12th June 2020 by Amb. Elly Kamahungye
;;;Kafeero after three months because the reasons for which the funds were
;;;withdrawn had been suspended. I found it unusual for an amount of
;;;money to be set aside for an activity without confirming the total cost of
;;;the activity or following procurement procedures to identify a supplier.
;;; During the year 2019/2020, the Finance Committee was comprised of the
;;;Head of Mission (chairperson), Deputy Head of Mission, Accounting
;;;Officer, Finance Attaché, Head of Chancery (Third Secretary) and the
;;;Administrative Attaché. I observed that the Committee did not perform its
;;;roles of reviewing and approving the budgets and work-plans, monitoring
;;;implementation of the annual work-plans and procurement plans,
;;;monitoring implementation of internal controls over financial
;;;management and ensuring that there is compliance with applicable laws
;;;and regulations.
     The Ministry has an approved strategic plan for FY 2020/21- 2024/25. NPA had issued a Certificate of Compliance (CoC) to the Ministry, and Ministry Top Management had approved the plan. It is now aligned to the NDPIII. The Ministry collected only 5.7% of its NTR target for the year and had a shortfall in government funding of UGX.19.886Bn which is 30.9% of the budget. The Ministry absorbed 92.3% of the funds that were released. Out of the thirty-two (32) outputs sampled, ten (10) were fully quantified, seventeen (17) were insufficiently quantified and five (5) were not quantified. Out of the ten (10) outputs assessed, seven (7) were fully implemented while three (3) were partially implemented. The Ministry prepared and submitted the annual budget implementation plans and reports as required but failed to accurately report and submit 37.
