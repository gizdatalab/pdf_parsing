For the under payments, the Accounting Officers attributed it mainly to suspension of staff salaries due to disciplinary issues, delayed removal of staff from the payroll and delays in resolving issues such as abscondment where payments were withheld. For delays in remittance of deductions, the Accounting Officers attributed it to delays in reconciliation of interface deduction files. ii) Un-authorized loans deductions I noted that 48 LGs made unauthorised loans deductions totaling UGX 11.10 Bn. The deductions were from 6,835 employees that lacked letters of consent/ undertaking. I further noted that out of the 48 LGs, 23 LGs (48%) registered 1,916 employees with deductions totaling to UGX 3.77 Bn that did not exist in the Payroll Deduction Management System (PDMS), operated by PCA-Payroll Consults Africa. There is a risk of making deductions from staff that have no loans, which deprives them of their earnings. The inconsistencies in the PDMS undermine the relevance of the system and affect the integrity of the data therein. The Accounting Officers acknowledged the shortcoming and explained that letters of undertaking were being signed although file copies were not being retained for future reference. They further explained that the inconsistencies in the PDMS data were attributed to PCA who largely control and manage the system.;;;;;;

I further noted that 407 employees in 17 LGs had not yet accessed the payroll by the close of the financial year. Delayed access to payroll leads to demotivation of the affected staff and accumulation of salary arrears. The Accounting Officers attributed the shortcoming mainly to delayed submission of key personnel documents and data mismatch between IPPS & NIRA.;;;;;;
