Contrary to Regulation 18 (1) of the PPDA (Contracts) Regulations, 2014, the Ministry issued call off orders to two firms in three separate procurements of office furniture worth UGX.144.8Mn under a framework contract where the items and prices on the call off orders were different from what was agreed on in the signed framework contract. This erodes the benefits of framework contracts and may cause a loss to Government. delivery. ;;;
2;Uganda Communications Commission. Unqualified Opinion;;Assessment of the Commission’s performance of Non Tax Revenue (NTR) revealed that out of the budgeted NTR of UGX.156.59Bn, a total of UGX.454.61 was collected, representing an increase of UGX.298Bn (190% of the target). Management attributed the overperformance to payment of the National Telecom Operator (NTO) license by two telecom 
;;;companies which had not been budgeted for. The Accounting Officer was
;;;advised to always conduct comprehensive research on all potential
;;;revenue sources for proper budgeting of NTR.
;;; Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.454.61Bn, only
;;;UGX.451.98Bn was spent by the entity resulting into an unspent balance
;;;of UGX.2.63Bn representing an absorption level of 99.5%. I commended
;;;the Accounting Officer for absorbing most of the funds availed despite the
;;;challenges during the year.
;;; I noted that several procurements to the tune of UGX.4.51Bn were not
;;;implemented as of 30th June 2021. As a result, implementation of critical
;;;Commission programs was delayed. Management attributed the delays in
;;;these procurements to the COVID-19 pandemic that paralysed the entire
;;;procurement process.
;;; The Commission discontinued issuing invoices to Uganda Telecom Ltd,
;;;Posta Uganda and Uganda Broadcasting Corporation due to tax
;;;implications where, the Commission has to pay VAT to URA on every
;;;invoice raised, whether funds are received or not. As a result, UCC ledger
;;;balances of UGX.85.1Bn differed from the reported receivables of
;;;UGX.13.1Bn, by a total of UGX.72.0Bn. Furthermore, I noted that the
;;;reported receivables by UCC from the same entities differed from the
;;;reported payables to UCC by the same entities. The Accounting Officer
;;;was advised to engage management of the affected entities with a view
;;;of reconciling to the correct receivable figures.
;;; The Commission did not charge the 2% gross annual levy on the licensed
;;;Television and FM radio operators and no licensed Television and FM
;;;radio operator had submitted Audited financial statements to the
;;;Commission for assessment. This denied the Commission the revenue to
;;;implement development programs.
;;; The Commission lacks a Tribunal with the jurisdiction to hear and
;;;determine all matters relating to communications services arising from
;;;decisions made by the Commission or the Minister, contrary to Section
;;;60(1 & 2) and 64(1) of the Uganda Communications Act, 2013. The
;;;accounting officer explained that the responsibility to appoint the tribunal
;;;resides with the President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service
;;;Commission. I advised management and the Board of Directors to liaise
;;;with the relevant authorities with the view of constituting the
;;;Communications Tribunal.
