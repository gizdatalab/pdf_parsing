     length of stay on remand increasing from 10.5 to 18.8 months for capital offenders and from 2.6 months to 3.8 months for petty offenders from 2016/17 to 2020/2021 respectively. For example out of the 32,409 prisoners on remand, a total of 13,933 prisoners had overstayed on remand I observed challenges of staff accommodation which currently stands at a deficit of 7,217 (65.1%) housing units with staff staying in temporary houses/shelters/not accommodated The Service also faced challenges of under staffing where out of an approved organisation structure comprising of 49,470 staff, only 12,860 (26%) posts were filled, leaving a balance of 36,610 (74%) posts vacant. This leads to high staff prisoner ratio and causes fatigue among the few staff I noted that sixty-seven (67) of the prison stations did not have buses to enable safe and secure transportation of prisoners to court which resulted into delayed delivery of prisoners to courts, transportation of high-risk inmates on open trucks, and prisoners and staff walking long distances to attend court. I noted delays in completion of the Prisoners Management Information System (PMIS) which has delayed the enjoyment of anticipated benefits from the system. I observed challenges in land management including encroachments, land disputes and encumbrances. Out of 158 pieces of land of different sizes in the different parts of the country, only 52 pieces were surveyed and titled, 17 pieces were surveyed but still not yet titled, while 89 pieces were not yet surveyed. Furthermore, the UPS did not have land surveying equipment;;;
