        The Authority collected NTR of UGX.8,084,594,955 (50.2%) against the estimated UGX.16,088,769,336 as projected by Ministry of MOFPED. However, there were no NTR estimates indicated in the statement of appropriation. Out of the budgeted GoU revenue of UGX.25,555,655,669 by the Authority, only UGX 18,809,799,829 was warranted representing performance of 73.6% of the target. I noted that out of the UGX.18,809,799,829 released to the Authority, only UGX.18,494,875,926 was spent representing an absorption level of 98.3%. Subsequently, the unspent funds amounting to UGX.314,923,903 were swept back to the Consolidated Fund. The Authority tune of UGX.1,963,413,072 and USD 2,805,651,484 which were not appropriated as required by the law. received off-budget funding to the 9 (69%) of the 13 activities (against which UGX 9,707,487,720 was released) were fully implemented and 4 (31%) of the activities were partially implemented. Contrary to the directive from the Ministry of Finance, during the financial year a total of UGX 441,857,268 was deposited directly into the National Environment Fund (NEF) account as NTR and this amount was not remitted to the consolidated fund. The Authority does not have any legal provision to regulate the work of the Environment Police. In addition, the funds to facilitate the work of the force were not budgeted for in the annual work plan and budget. Financial records indicate that only UGX.21,280,000 was spent on the force during the year. I noted that all the wetlands in Uganda are not gazetted, contrary to Section 2 of the National Environment Act 2019, although they are indicated on the maps. In addition, contrary to Instrument 2 of the Nation Environment Act, 2019 (Commencement) that empowers the Authority to enforce wetland gazetting, the Authority went ahead to collect NTR from wetland user permits amounting to UGX 8,800,000 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY Unqualified 7 Opinion;;;
