Funds to the tune of UGX.184,722,054 were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. Out of the planned 31 strategic targets/goals in the Mission charter, 13 were fully achieved while 18 were partially achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.3.64Bn representing 0.7% performance. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.8,039,710,935, UGX.7,707,884,006 was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.331,826,929 representing an absorption level of 96%. I sampled 6 outputs with a total of 17 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.7.67Bn and observed that all 6 outputs were not quantified. I was therefore unable to undertake assessment of performance. The Mission did not prepare and submit annual monitoring plans to MoFPED and NPA and also did not prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and MoFPED contrary to Paragraph 58 of the Budget Execution Circular for 2019/20. Performance reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 were submitted after the deadline given for submission. The Mission paid USD.27,500 (equivalent to UGX.103,134,075) in respect of education allowances direct to its officials instead of their respective educational institutions or schools contrary to Section (E - e) Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Public Service Standing Orders 2010. The Embassy spent USD.21,764.99 (equivalent to UGX.81,625,894.95) on refunds for medical expenses to its officers contrary to the requirements of Section M (m-a) (14) of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2010. USD.18,000 (equivalent to UGX.69,552,175) was paid to Embassy staff as Covid relief allowance during the financial year 2019/2020 in the last month of the financial year. This allowance is not provided for in the Public Service Standing Orders and neither was it budgeted for during the year. JPY.2,591,132 (equivalent to UGX.89,938,192) out of which 2/3 of the amount should have been recovered from the respective staff was incurred on the payments for telephone bills during the period. The recovery was not effected. The fixed assets register maintained by the entity was not in the format prescribed in the Treasury Instructions and lacked details of: cost of some items, maintenance cost, estimated useful life, among others and assets which had already been disposed were still in the assets register.             33.
