    land titles has led to heavy encroachment and grabbing of the Corporation’s land. URC procured four (4) used locomotives at UGX.41,323,768,935. I noted that the bidder did not comply with some requirements within the bid document which were supposed to be the basis of evaluation. Despite the non-compliance at the preliminary stage, the bid was evaluated at the Technical stage without following procurement regulations. Government signed an agreement with Mango Tree (U) Ltd for the rehabilitation and upgrade of the Pamba ferry. However, the vessel was still grounded after a year of signing the agreement. An officer of URC irregularly signed to transfer land measuring 4.452 hectares in Lira (under FRV 220 Folio 13). The land was subdivided into plots 41-63, 52-62, 42-50 and the titles were being processed.

"    I observed slow progress in Construction works and accumulation of loan charges. As of June 30th 2021, the contractor had only achieved 3.42% against 29.18% planned cumulative progress. The total time lapse since commencement of the construction works was 19 months constituting 64.01% of the total contract duration yet only 3.42% construction work had been achieved.

I observed failure to procure Prefabricated Pipe Culvert Units to the project which is delaying project progress. The contractor could not progress through pipe culvert installation due to lack the culverts. There were delays in payments to the contractor that are likely to lead to interest charges. I observed that on 2nd June 2021, the contractor issued IPC No. 3 amounting to UGX 8,303,000,336 which was unpaid by 30th June, 2021 and interest on the late payment was due to commence on 28th July 2021. I observed delayed possession of site and land take over by the contractor. By 30th June, 2021, land acquisition was at 54.8% or 14.605 km of the main expressway where access to and possession was granted. It is to be noted that 100% access to and possession should have been formally handed over after 18 months (that is; 22nd May 2021) from commencement.  UNRA reallocated GOU counterpart funding to other projects for the year ended 30th June, 2020.
