       the entity work plan revealed cases where the reported set targets were not consistent with the set targets in the entity work plans. I observed conflicting in the Council governing laws. Section 51(2) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 requires the Accounting Officer of a public corporation, within two months after the end of each financial year, to prepare and submit to the Accountant-General, a summary statement of financial performance of the public corporation and give a copy of the summary statement to the Secretary to the Treasury. On the contrary, Section 18 (1) Part IV of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 1996 requires the Council to keep proper books of accounts and prepare the annual financial statements of accounts for the immediately preceding financial year not later than three months in the following year. Conflict in the governing laws hampers effective execution of UNMC mandate. Section 4 of the UNMC Act 1996, requires each Council member to be a seconded representative of a particular institution or body and must be appointed by the Minister. However, a review of Council Members records revealed that out of the seventeen (17) members, none of them were seconded representatives of their respective bodies. Good Corporate Governance practices require separation of duties of board members to ensure their independence in the discharge of duties. On the contrary, a review of the composition of the Audit Committee revealed that Chairperson of the full council is also a member of the committee. I noted that the Council had not been managed by a substantive Registrar since 2017. The current Registrar’s initial appointment ran from November 2018 to March 2019. However, management did not provide a valid appointment letter to confirm her appointment after March 2019. A review of the Governing council minute ref FC/08/14/06/2020 revealed that council members were concerned about the significant delays in issuing of Practicing Certificates that hindered the recruitment of nurses in the industry. Furthermore, Management did not avail status reports on certificates that were produced. Payment files and PPDA monthly reports revealed that supplies and service worth UGX 46,183,800 were procured and paid without going through the procurement process given that there were no LPOs or procurement documents availed to confirm that the supplier went through the procurement process. UNMC has three (3) operational vehicles. However, a detailed review of the fleet management revealed that there were no log books maintained to track the vehicle movements as required by the regulations. Further, there were no records being maintained to keep track of vehicle history, performance, servicing, overheads, repairs and maintenance.;;;
7.;Uganda Sanitation Fund (USF) – Ministry of Health Project. 2019/20 Opinion;; A review of the annual work plan and the performance reports for the Uganda Sanitation Fund revealed that there were inconsistencies in planned targets and those reported upon. Furthermore, the planned targets/outputs in the work plan lacked sufficient detail (description of outputs) to facilitate a meaningful comparison with the targets in the performance reports.
