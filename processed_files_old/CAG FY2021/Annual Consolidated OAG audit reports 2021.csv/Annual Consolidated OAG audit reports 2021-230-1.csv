    The Authority awarded multi-year contracts to the tune of UGX.18.7Bn without evidence of approval of these multi-year commitments by the Parliament. This was contrary to Section 23(1) of the PFMA 2015. Planned procurements worth UGX.25.1Bn were not implemented by 30th June 2021. This adversely affects the realisation of critical government programs. Management explained that the delays were due to various reasons, some of which are beyond their control. During the financial year 2020/21, the collaborating institutions under the Tax Registration and Expansion Programme (TREP) registered only 167,211 taxpayers against a target of 436,869 taxpayers representing a 38.27% registration success and a shortfall of 61.7%. In revenue terms, although TREP had a revenue target of UGX.124.58 Bn in FY 2020/21, it had only collected UGX.49.93Bn by 30th June 2021, representing a 40% performance rate. The paltry performance was attributed to COVID-19 effects, riots and the political environment, that hindered field activities. The Ministry of Local Government had planned to implement activities worth UGX.4.4Bn under TREP activities but only implemented activities worth UGX.3.3Bn, leaving un-implemented activities worth UGX.1.1Bn despite receiving all funding. As a result, the e-LogRev objective of simplifying and strengthening the local revenue collection systems for Local Governments may not be achieved in time.;;;
4;URA Revenue Collection Account 2020/21;;The Authority had a total revenue collection target of UGX.22.039Tn for the financial year 2020/21, and collected total gross revenue of UGX.19.649Tn, representing 89% hence a shortfall of UGX.2.39Tn 
;;;(11%). Under collection of revenue affects cash flow performance of
;Unqualified Opinion;;Government and realisation of the planned service delivery targets. Management attributed the performance to the adverse impact of COVID-
;;;19 pandemic.
;;; I reviewed the statement of comparison of target and actual revenue
;;;collection by the tax head and noted that revenues from different sources
;;;worth UGX.86.979Bn were not budgeted for, despite collecting significant
;;;incomes on these tax heads for the past two years leading to under-
;;;budgeting. Lack of budget provisions of the tax heads conceals revenue
;;;potential, distorts revenue projections and may lead to un-appropriate
;;;performance assessments and related bonuses.
;;; Uganda Tax/GDP ratio remained low at 12.5% in 2020/21, compared to
;;;other countries in the region and globally. This performance was similar
;;;to last year's performance. This implies that tax bases have not widened
;;;or deepened enough to tax all potential sources.
;;; There was an increase in total Tax Arrears from UGX.3.009Tn in 2019/20
;;;to UGX.4.519Tn in the financial year 2020/21 representing a total
;;;increase of UGX.1.492Tn or percentage increase in total Tax Arrears of
;;;50%. The Increase denies Government the required resources to deliver
;;;more services.
;;; The contract between the Government of Uganda (GoU) and a private
;;;company had since expired even though the Company had continued to
;;;manufacture motor vehicle registration numbers for taxpayers. Expired
;;;contracts expose the Government to the risk of loss of revenue without a
;;;remedy.
;;; I noted that government had continued to engage only two private
;;;companies, making them monopolies in providing motor vehicle
;;;registration number plates for more than eight (8) years without opening
;;;it up for competition. The Monopoly exposes the taxpayer to high prices
