The Corporation has an operating margin of 1.2%, which is below the 50% compared to 2.1% realized in the previous year 2019/20 representing a reduction of 43% which implies that the Corporation is having a lower proportion of revenues covering expenses rather than profits or income. The Corporation made profits of UGX.32,789,541 after tax in the year under review up from profits of UGX.30,230,727 realized in the previous year representing a rise in profits of 8.5%. However the Corporation had negative retained earnings of UGX.1,441,914,445 as at the end of the financial year which may affect the entity’s ability to meet future contingencies or investments in growth. The corporation posted a return on assets of only 0.4% down from 0.56% posted in the previous year, representing a reduction in ROA of 28.6%. This implies that the Corporation is not making enough income from the use of its assets. The Corporation had a current ratio of 2,123 for the year under review which was far above the desirable range of 1.5 – 2.0. The very high current ratio implies that the Corporation is not efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing facilities.
