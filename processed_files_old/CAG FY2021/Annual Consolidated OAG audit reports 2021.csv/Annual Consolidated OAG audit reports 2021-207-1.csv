       Out of the planned 7 strategic targets/goals, no target was fully achieved, 5 targets were fully achieved and 2 targets were partially achieved. There was a shortfall in NTR collections amounting to UGX.1.85Bn representing 11% performance. Out of the total receipts for the financial year of UGX.4.16Bn, UGX.3.81Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.0.35Bn representing an absorption level of 91.5%. I sampled 5 outputs with a total of 9 activities and actual expenditure of UGX.3.76Bn and observed that 3 outputs with a total of 7 activities and expenditure worth UGX.3.76Bn were fully quantified while 2 outputs with a total of 2 activities were not quantified. I further observed that 2 outputs with 5 activities worth UGX.3.22Bn were fully implemented while 1 output with 2 activities worth UGX.0.674Bn was partially implemented. Funds to the tune of Birr.304,045.69 (equivalent to UGX.23,958,820) were irregularly diverted from the activities on which they were budgeted and spent on other activities without seeking and obtaining the necessary approvals. A review of the 4 quarterly performance reports revealed that the supplementary release of UGX.0.653Bn was not captured at all making the reports inaccurate. The Mission had total collections including balance brought forward from previous year of UGX.707,901,392 out of which UGX.236,256,209 had been transferred to the Treasury for onward transfer to the Consolidated Fund leaving a balance UGX.471,645,183 not remitted.  USD.48,129.83 and BIRR.94,144.96 (equivalent to UGX.183,940,336) 35.
