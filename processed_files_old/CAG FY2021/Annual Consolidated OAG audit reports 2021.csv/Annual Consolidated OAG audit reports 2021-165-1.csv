"           NIRA prepared a strategic plan for the period 2020-2025, which was approved by the National Planning Authority. However, the plan is yet to be approved by the Board of the Authority for implementation. NIRA budgeted to collect NTR of UGX.15.0Bn during the year. However, by the end of the year, NIRA had collected a total of UGX.3.66Bn. Out of the total GoU receipts for the financial year of UGX.55.2Bn, only UGX.53.3Bn was spent by the entity resulting in an unspent balance of UGX.1.7Bn representing an absorption level of 97%. As a result, I noted that of the twenty-four (24) fully quantified activities worth UGX.70.6Bn assessed; 10 activities representing 42% were fully implemented, 12 activities representing 50% were partially implemented, while 2 activities representing 8% were not implemented at all. I assessed the extent of service delivery and noted that only 11% of the planned 1,712,880 citizens were registered during the year, while only 30% of the planned 2,000,000 National IDs were issued. I assessed the progress on registration of births and deaths and observed that NIRA registered 90% of the planned 960,000 births and only 1.3% of the 960,000 deaths. A review of the progress of registering citizens indicated that as of December 2021, 29,713,029 applications, or 69% of all Ugandans, had applied to NIRA for registration. Of these, only 25,557,448 or 86% of the applicants had been registered, and only 16,258,521 (63.6%) have been issued with National Identity cards. Only 16.3 million cards out of the over 19 million national identity cards so far printed have been claimed, leaving over 2.7 million cards unissued or unclaimed. At the time of audit (December 2021), the Authority had over 4.3 million applications yet to be processed. Of these, 3.2 million applications were still being processed, while 1.1 million applications have been rejected. NIRA plans to register at least 28,000 aliens annually and issue them with the relevant identification cards. From 2015 to date, the entity has only received 16 applications for alien IDs, and no Alien ID has been issued. A reviewed the outcome of the initiative to register learners (or school going children within their schools) undertaken in 2017/2018 to determine whether all registered learners had been issued with NINs. I noted that records of over 1.8 million (or 19%) learners’ who registered during that exercise had been rejected and thus not processed for issuance of NINs and Identification Cards. NIRA failed to procure over 4,500,000 million IDs from the Uganda Security Printing Company as the Joint Venture Agreement required. As a result, the entity has recognised a contingent liability of UGX.33.5Bn. National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA). 2020/21 Unqualified 16 Opinion";;;
