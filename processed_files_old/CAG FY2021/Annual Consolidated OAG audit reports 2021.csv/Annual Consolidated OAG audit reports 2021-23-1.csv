;From the procedures undertaken I noted that out of 94 entities;
;sampled, 75 were supposed to prepare strategic plans that were;
;aligned to NDPII. However, out of 75 only 25 (33%) had their;
;strategic plans certified by NPA. The balance of 50 representing 67%;
;were not certified by NPA. There is a risk that activities implemented;
;by these entities during the financial year 2020/2021 were not;
;aligned to the NDP-III which negatively affects the achievement of;
;NDP-III objectives.;

I advised the Accounting Officers to comply with the law and guidance given by the PSST and ensure that in future, all funds received outside the approved budget are appropriated by way of a supplementary. h) Off Budget Financing/Receipts Section 43 (1) of the PFMA 2015 states that all expenditure incurred by the government on externally financed projects in a financial year shall be appropriated by parliament. Paragraph 29 of the Budget Execution Circular for the Financial year states that if an external agency provides funds in the course of implementation of the budget or any funds remain unspent at the expiry of an appropriation, these must be declared and a supplementary issued in line with the Public Finance Management Act 2015. noted that 30 entities received off-budget financing to a tune of UGX.627.124Bn, which was never declared to the PS/ST and was also not appropriated by Parliament. As such, no supplementary appropriation was issued as guided by the PS/ST. These funds were received directly from development partners for undertaking activities not budgeted for. Off-budget financing distorts planning, may result in duplication of activities, contrary to Section 43(1) of the PFMA 2015 and the budget execution guidelines. Accounting Officers explained that this was due to limitations of the PBS system which has no provision for inputting such receipts and in some cases funds are received during the year which were not expected at the time of planning.
